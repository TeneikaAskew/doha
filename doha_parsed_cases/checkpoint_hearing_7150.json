Coacher, Esquire\nFor Applicant: Sheldon I. Cohen, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its denial of Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance. Specifically, it alleged facts which raise concerns under\nGuidelines H, Drug Involvement, J, Criminal Conduct, and E, Personal Conduct. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 20, 2008, and requested a hearing. I was\nassigned the case on April 10, 2008. On April 17, 2008, the hearing was scheduled for\nMay 16, 2008. During the hearing, I received five government exhibits, 23 Applicant\nexhibits, and the testimony of six Applicant witnesses. I received the transcript on May\nJune 19, 2008\n\n2\n27, 2008. After reviewing the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old married man with three children. The two oldest are 13\nyears old and 22 months old, respectively. The third is an infant that he and his wife\nadopted from a developing country in September 2007 (Tr. 187). Applicant has taken\nsome college courses.\nFrom 1996 to 2003, Applicant served in the U.S. Army. He was an industrious\nsoldier with an aptitude for satellite communications technology. He received multiple\nawards including Company Soldier of the Year, and Regional Soldier of the Year in\n1999 (Exhibits H and I, Tr. 194). He frequently worked overtime on projects (Exhibit S at\n1).\nIn May 2000, Applicant was promoted to a non-commissioned officer (NCO)\nposition after completing a non-commissioned officer\u2019s course with honors (Exhibit O).\nYounger soldiers respected him, considering him one of the \u201ccompany father figures\u201d\n(Tr. 56). He was 24-years-old at the time. By approximately 2002, Applicant had a top\nsecret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) (Exhibit 1\nat 14, Tr. 240).\nFrom 1997 to 2003, Applicant smoked marijuana approximately 15 to 20 times\nwith fellow soldiers in two duty locations. In one of the duty locations, he also smoked it\nwith a family member who had been living in his home (Tr. 172). Fearing adverse job\nconsequences, he did not disclose it on a security clearance application completed in\n1999 (Tr. 245). One evening in March 2003 while at a party at a local college, Applicant\nshared two cigarettes laced with cocaine (Tr. 212 - 213). The next day, he was ordered\nto take a random drug test. Over the next two weeks, while the drug test was pending,\nhe used marijuana once more (Tr. 239).\nApplicant tested positive for cocaine (Tr. 214). Subsequently, he was the subject\nof Non-Judicial Punishment/Article 15 proceedings. He was reduced one paygrade,\nordered to forfeit half of his pay for two months, and served 45 days restriction. Also, his\nsecurity clearance was suspended.\nApplicant\u2019s command gave him the option of transferring to another position or\nleaving the military (Tr. 218). He chose the latter option, and was honorably discharged\nin April 2003 (Exhibit A). \nIn November 2003, Applicant began working as a communications engineer for a\ndefense contractor. He worked there for approximately three years. He spent all but two\nweeks of the first two years of his stint with this employer in either Iraq or Afghanistan\ninstalling and maintaining satellite communications systems, and securing radio\nfrequencies (Tr. 116, 121, 222). \n\n3\nThe work was dangerous. Applicant lived outside of the Green Zone in Iraq. He\nwore body armor and carried a weapon (Tr. 224). Once, he and some coworkers had to\nshoot suppression fire at a hostile crowd that was converging on the hotel where they\nwere residing (Tr. 225). On another occasion, part of a convoy that was transporting\nApplicant was destroyed by a roadside bomb (Tr. 136). While in Afghanistan, Applicant\nprovided onsite communications support to teams of Afghani workers, civilian police,\nand U.S. military tasked with poppy eradication (Tr. 138). Much of the area the teams\ncovered was rural, desolate and littered with unexploded ordnance. On one occasion, a\nteam member\u2019s hand was blown off by a land mine (Tr. 139). \nIn September 2005, after returning to the U.S., Applicant accompanied his then-\nsupervisor to the U.S. Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina to help a local police\ndepartment rebuild its communications infrastructure (Tr. 127). The job took\napproximately a month to complete. When he arrived, the municipality was under\nmartial law (Tr. 198). The police department deputized Applicant during this period\n(Exhibit V). The department sheriff is \u201ceternally grateful\u201d for the assistance Applicant\nprovided (Exhibit W).\nApplicant was laid off in August 2006 for reasons unrelated to performance\n(Exhibit 1 at 13). His supervisor characterized him as dependable, hardworking, and\ndedicated (Tr. 121).\nSince October 2006, Applicant has worked for his current employer as a radio\nfrequency engineer. His duties include designing, maintaining, and securing satellite\nnetworks (Tr. 50, 84). He is \u201cwell respected by his colleagues and supervisors and\nrelied upon as an esteemed member of [his] department\u201d (Exhibit U). His current\nsupervisor describes him as \u201csecond to none\u201d (Tr. 98). Also, he is dedicated to his\nprofession, continually researching new software updates and maintenance procedures\n(Tr. 62 - Testimony of Co-Worker).\nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since July 2003 (Exhibit 3 at 2). Since then,\nhe has attended pastoral counseling when not working out of town. He disclosed his\ndrug use history to the state social service agency that facilitated the adoption of his\nyoungest child. Before finalizing the adoption, the agency conducted a home study, and\nrequired him to undergo two months of random drug testing, which he passed (Tr. 177-\n179).\nIn December 2006, Applicant completed another security clearance application.\nIn an effort \u201cto leave no stone unturned\u201d (Tr. 231), he was fully forthcoming about his\ndrug use history.\nApplicant is active in his church. He helps manage the church\u2019s nursery class (Tr.\n170).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The government reposes a high degree of\ntrust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\n\n5\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Here, Applicant\u2019s drug use while possessing a\nsecurity clearance, and the subsequent failed drug test, triggers the application of AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use,\u201d and 25(g), \u201cany\nillegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d\nDuring a six-year-period, Applicant used marijuana approximately three times per\nyear, and used cocaine once. He did not use drugs before then, and he has not used in\nthe five years since then. I conclude his use was not frequent. Its infrequency is\noutweighed, however, by the negative inferences generated by his decision to use\ndrugs while in the Army, entrusted with a top secret clearance and SCI access, and his\nintentional failure to disclose it on a 1999 security clearance application.\nNevertheless, the amount of time that has elapsed since the last use outweighs\nthe negative inferences generated by the nature and surrounding circumstances of his\nuse. There is no bright line definition of what constitutes recent conduct. Instead, it\ndepends on the totality of the record evidence (ISCR Case No. 03-02374). Applicant\u2019s\ndrug abuse occurred between ages 19 and 25. Since then, his employers have\nrepeatedly entrusted him with high-pressure tasks under unusual and/or dangerous\ncircumstances. He has performed admirably. \nApplicant\u2019s personal life has been equally distinguished. He adopted a child from\na developing country, and is actively involved in a local church, attending pastoral\ncounseling, and assisting with the church nursery school. The adoption is particularly\nsignificant because he had to participate in home study that included two months of\nrandom drug testing before it was finalized.\nApplicant has been fully forthcoming about his past drug use during the current\nsecurity clearance investigative process. His testimony reflected a recognition of the\ngravity of his past transgressions. He has always been a talented individual. During his\nyears in the military, however, he lacked the equally important characteristics of maturity\nand good judgement. Throughout the past five years, he has developed these\ncorresponding attributes. Upon considering these facts, in addition to Applicant\u2019s\ncredible, introspective testimony, I conclude that the significant rehabilitation that has\noccurred since he last used drugs mitigates the possibility of recurrence. AG \u00b6 24(a),\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago . . . that it is unlikely to recur . . \u201c, and AG\n\u00b624(b)(3),\u201da demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as an\nappropriate period of abstinence\u201d apply.\nApplicant has mitigated the Drug Involvement Security concern.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder Article 112(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, wrongful use of\nillegal substances such as marijuana and cocaine is a crime. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s\nrepeated marijuana use and one-time cocaine use while in the military generates a\n\n6\nsecurity concern under AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d\nand AG \u00b631(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nFor the reasons set forth in the Drug Involvement section, above, I conclude AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened . . . that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement,\u201d apply. Applicant has mitigated the Criminal Conduct security\nconcern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation,\u201d (AG \u00b615). Here, Applicant\u2019s drug use while in the military led to the\nsuspension of his security clearance in addition to Article 15 proceedings. Ultimately, it\nhastened his departure from the military. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment\nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as . . .engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal professional, or community standing,\u201d applies. \nFor the reasons set forth in the Drug Involvement Section, above, AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201c. .\n. so much time has passed . .  that [the conduct] is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\nApplicant has mitigated the Personal Conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nBy using illegal drugs and lying about it on a 1999 security clearance, Applicant\ncommitted a serious dereliction of his responsibilities as a soldier, and betrayed the trust\nbestowed upon him by his family. He has been drug-free for five years. In that time, he\nhas lived an exemplary life, earning the trust, respect, and admiration of his professional\ncolleagues, and has restored the trust of his family. I conclude the rehabilitation, and the\ntime that has elapsed since the last drug use outweighs the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although Applicant has paid, or is\npaying, all the debts alleged in the SOR, it is simply too early to say whether or not she\nwill be ultimately successful keeping her finances stable.  Even her current success\n3\nrelies on her sister assuming the largest debt alleged in the SOR. \n\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\n4\nthat it is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . .\n5\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c)the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n6\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n\u00b6 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\n8\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n9\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n4\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide Applicant mixed relief.\nHer financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were largely due to\n4\ncircumstances beyond her control if examined from her actually separation from her\nhusband in January 2004, but not if examined from 1997, when they began having\nmarital issues. She certainly did not act responsibly during the course of her financial\nproblems, opening serial accounts. She has certainly been more responsible in\naddressing her debts more recently.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit\n5\ncounseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  The timing of current\n6\npayments calls into question whether these payments constitute a good-faith effort to\nsatisfy her debts.  In the best-case characterization of her current financial situation,\n7\nApplicant appears to have stopped digging a financial hole, and may have crawled away\nfrom the hole a bit. What is not clear is whether she will be able to avoid falling back into\nthe hole. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline E,\nand Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Given her recent financial situation\nI conclude she deliberately concealed her financial delinquencies from the government.8\nShe acknowledges that she knew she had financial problems in the past, yet there is no\nindication anywhere on her clearance application that this was the case. Even if I\naccepted her claim that she had repayment plans on many of the debts, there were\nseveral debts that had no repayment plans, or that had only been paid recently.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose her financial difficulties\nuntil her subject interview.  Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose her adverse finances\n9\ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an\ninterest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant\nbefore making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully\ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when they perceive disclosure\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse\n\n5\ninformation about himself provides some indication of her willingness to report\ninadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the\ngovernment relies on to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of\nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests She is willing to put her personal\nneeds ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On February 20, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\n\n2\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided\nupon the written record.  On September 16, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nHenry Lazzaro denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Of the debts alleged in the SOR,\nApplicant admitted responsibility for four, totaling $15,301, although she provided proof of payment\nfor one of the debts, in the amount of $576.  Applicant claimed to have paid another of those debts,\namounting to $202, but did not provide proof of payment.  Applicant denied knowledge of five other\ndebts totaling $2,859.  Applicant also denied that she falsified her public trust position application\nwhen she stated that she did not have any debts more than 180 days delinquent. \nUnder Guideline F, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to the debt for which she\nsubmitted proof of payment.  He found against Applicant as to the other debts.  Under Guideline E,\nthe Judge found that Applicant did not falsify her application, because she was unaware that she had\ndebts more than 180 days delinquent.  \nIn her appeal, Applicant restates some information which was in the record before the Judge.\nShe objects to the Judge\u2019s conclusions and contends that the Judge should have found her financial\nsituation to be mitigated by her personal circumstances.  Applicant also submits new information\nwhich was not in the record at the time the Judge made his trustworthiness determination.  This\nincludes recent steps Applicant has taken to improve her financial situation, e.g., contesting some\nof the debts on her credit reports and paying a delinquent debt.  Because this information constitutes\nnew evidence, the Board cannot consider it.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1. 29.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 05-\n12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-12130 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,\n2007).  Here, the Judge found some mitigation, but explained why it was insufficient to overcome\nthe government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient\nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant chose to have her case decided on the written\nrecord, with the result that her credibility could not be evaluated in the context of a hearing.  The\nJudge\u2019s decision is sustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned Jean e. Smallin    \nJean E.

The\n1\nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline\nE (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an undated response to the SOR. On March 31,\n2008, she was notified by DOHA that her response was considered incomplete and she\nwas being provided an additional ten days to submit a complete response. Applicant\nsubmitted a second response that was received by DOHA on April 22, 2008.

Applicant was informed she had 30 days\nfrom receipt of the FORM to submit her objections to any information contained in the\nFORM or to submit any additional information she wished to be considered. Applicant\nacknowledged receipt of the FORM on May 20, 2008, but did not submit a response to the\nFORM or object to anything contained in the FORM within the time allowed her. The case\nwas assigned to me on July 22, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 47 years old. She has been employed in the customer support field by\na defense contractor since January 2006. She was employed outside the defense industry\nas an office worker from July 2006 to January 2007, in the customer support field from\nSeptember 2005 to May 2006, and as an accounts representative from June 1997 to\nAugust 2005. She was unemployed from August to September 2005, and again from June\nto July 2006. \nApplicant has been married since April 2006. She has three children, ages 25,\n20,and 18. None of the children apparently live with Applicant, as indicated by her address\nand the addresses of her children as listed in the security clearance application she\nsubmitted in January 2007.\nApplicant admits she is responsible for four debts alleged in the SOR, totaling\n$15,301, that have either been charged off as bad debts or submitted for collection. Each\nof those debts has been delinquent since late 2006 or early 2007. Applicant submitted\nproof she paid one of those debts, owing in the amount of $576, in October 2006. She\nclaims to have paid a second debt, owing in the amount of $202, but she not submit any\nproof of payment. No payment has been made on the other two debts since November\n2006.\nThe SOR also alleges a debt that is past due in the amount of $783, and another\ndebt that has been placed for collection in the amount of $758. Applicant claims to have\nno knowledge of the identity of the creditors listed for these accounts. Each of these\naccounts is listed in her credit reports, dated January 10 and December 10, 2007.\nApplicant also claims to have no knowledge of the three medical accounts listed in\nthe SOR, totaling $1,318, that have been submitted for collection. Again, each of these\naccounts is listed in the credit reports included in the FORM.\nApplicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) in January 2007.\nIn response to questions inquiring whether she was then over 180 days delinquent on any\nfinancial obligation, she answered \u201cNo\u201d.  None of the debts listed in the SOR are alleged\nto have become past due, submitted for collection, or charged off as bad debts earlier than\nJune 2006. \n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n2\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n3\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n4\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n5\n3\nDepartment Counsel correctly noted in the FORM that Applicant\u2019s credit reports\nindicates the \u201cdate of last activity\u201d for the medical bills that have been submitted for\ncollection was a year before she submitted the SF 85P. However, the credit reports also\nindicate those debts were not \u201creported\u201d any earlier than June 2006. There is no other\nevidence to indicate when these debts were submitted for collection or that Applicant had\nactual knowledge of the medical debts prior to issuance of the SOR. Additionally, Applicant\nwrote in her answer to the SOR that she had medical insurance with her former employer,\nmade the required co-pays for health care, and impliedly believed all medical charges were\ncovered by insurance.   \nWithout much elaboration, Applicant attributes her financial delinquency to medical\nproblems that caused her husband to become unemployed from August to sometime\nbefore October in an unspecified year. Presuming his unemployment occurred in 2006,\nwhen the majority of the debts began to become severely delinquent, Applicant fails to\nprovide any justification for her failure to at least begin to resolve the majority of the debts\nbefore now other than some vague references to the economy and the inability of her\nhusband, a self-employed general contractor, to find work.\nApplicant also refers to instances of improper and unauthorized activity involving her\nbank account that caused checks she had written to be returned due to insufficient funds.\nShe also refers to some confusion of her identity with another individual that might have\nresulted in fraud in connection with her account. However, she also admits that four debts\nlisted in the SOR, totaling about $15,000 out of the approximately $18,000 in delinquent\ndebts that are alleged, are her responsibility. Thus, even assuming there was some\nunauthorized activity that may have effected her credit reports, the majority of the\ndelinquent debt alleged in the SOR is clearly Applicant\u2019s responsibility.  \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n2\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.3\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n4\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.5\n\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n6\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n4\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.6\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n7\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n8\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant has a number of delinquent accounts, totalling about $18,000, that were\npast due, submitted for collection, or charged off as bad debts. Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations apply.\nThe accounts listed in the SOR have been delinquent for at least two years.\nApplicant submitted proof that she has satisfied only one of the listed accounts. She\nclaimed to have paid another account, but did not submit any verification in support of that\nassertion. She indicated she has no knowledge of other accounts, but only provided\nevidence that there apparently was unrelated unauthorized activity involving her bank\naccount that does not establish these accounts are not her responsibility.\nApplicant primarily attributed her financial problems to her husband\u2019s unemployment\nand his difficulty in finding customers. She submitted letters from a minister and a therapist\n\n5\nin support of her claim that this has been the cause of her financial problems and that she\nhas sought their advice in dealing with the issues she has experienced. However, each of\nthose letters strongly indicate Applicant\u2019s financial problems are severe and ongoing. On\nMarch 19, 2008, the therapist wrote: \u201cThey have been facing a high level of financial stress\nover the past year and are doing their best to maintain good faith with their creditors.\u201d (Item\n4) On the same day, the minister wrote: \u201cIn recent months (Applicant and her husband)\nhave been plagued with financial and medical issues far beyond their control. . . .\u201d (Item\n4) \nApplicant did not present evidence to what extent the injury suffered by her\nhusband, to whom she has only been married since April 2006, has impacted their ability\nto pay their bills other than the letters from the therapist and minister, what if any loss of\nincome they have suffered, or what affirmative actions she and her husband have taken\nto resolve the financial problems they experienced as a result thereof. Most importantly,\nshe failed to present any reason to conclude that her financial problems will be resolved\nin the near future. \nApplicant is entitled to consideration and at least partial application of MC 20(b): the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. However, there is insufficient record evidence to conclude that whatever\nactions she has taken in attempting to resolve her financial problems have been the\nresponsible course of action under the circumstances.  \nFurther, I have considered all the record evidence and find Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(c): the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control; and 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts do not apply. The remaining mitigating\nconditions have no applicability to the facts in this case. Guideline F is decided against\nApplicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the (sensitive position eligibility) process or any failure to cooperate with\nthe (sensitive position eligibility) process.\nApplicant submitted an SF 85P in January 2007, and in response to a question\ninquiring whether she was then over 180 days delinquent on any financial obligation she\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d. The record evidence is insufficient to establish she had knowledge that any\naccounts were that far delinquent at the time she submitted the SF 85P. Accordingly, the\npersonal conduct concern is decided for Applicant.\n\n6\nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concerns. She has not overcome the case against her\nnor satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. Guideline F is decided against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f-i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

At times, \nhe acknowledged he was drinking too much. He has previously acknowledged he was \nan alcoholic, but no longer believes this to be true. Applicant had an 18 month to two \nyear period where he illegally used Tylox and Valium while holding a security clearance. \nI conclude Applicant has not rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns \nunder Guideline G, alcohol consumption, or Guideline E, personal conduct. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nJuly 16, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 20, 2007, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \n \n \nOn January 14, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn December 20, 2007, I was assigned the case. On March 12, 2008, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on March 27, 2008. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, which were admitted into evidence. The \nrecord was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On April 8, 2008, \nadditional documents were received. Department Counsel did not object to the material \nand it was admitted into evidence as Ex. C. On April 17, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add SOR \nparagraph 1.g to read, \u201cIn October 2005, Applicant was ticketed for public intoxication \nand paid a fine of approximately $90.\u201d (Tr. 28) Applicant did not object and the motion \nwas granted. (Tr. 29) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the factual allegations in the SOR, \nwith explanations, except for \u00b6 1.f, which he denied. \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old scientist/engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since November 2002, and he is seeking to maintain a security clearance. \nCo-workers and supervisors state Applicant has worked tirelessly and reliably, to be of \nexcellent character, maintained a high level of performance for extended periods of \ntime, and demonstrated excellent performance. He is reliable, punctual, organized, and \ncareful in his preparation. (Ex A, Tr. 30) His evaluation ending December 2004, listed \nhis duty assessment between having \u201cmet some expectations\u201d to \u201cexceeded \nexpectations.\u201d His evaluation ending December 2005 evaluates him as having some \n\u201cmet expectations\u201d but more \u201cexceeded expectations.\u201d An evaluation ended December \n2006, rates him as \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d and \u201cfar exceeded expectations.\u201d \n \n \nIn February 1985, Applicant then age 17, drove into a ditch when driving home \nfrom a high school party. He was found guilty of Driving Under the Influence (DUI), \nordered to complete an Alcohol Safety Awareness Program, and fined $50. \n \n \nIn June 1992, Applicant married and has five children who are between the ages \nof 2 and 13. (Ex. 1, Ex. B, Tr. 32) Six months before the wedding, Applicant, then age \n24, asked his uncle for some Antabuse because Applicant thought he was drinking too \nmuch and believed he might have a drinking problem. (Tr. 99) He \u201cwould drink a lot on \nthe weekends at that time.\u201d (Tr. 102) He did not drink the six months before the \nwedding.  \n \n \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n \n \nFrom April 1995 until July 1999, he illegally used the prescription drugs of Tylox \nand Valium approximately several dozen times. His abuse of prescription medications \nwas coupled with alcohol use. (Ex. 2) Applicant suffered from head aches. (Tr. 85) On a \ntrip to visit his in-laws, his mother-in-law offered him Tylox and Valium for which she had \na prescription for chronic back pain the result of a car accident. (Tr. 132) After taking the \nmedication, Applicant felt great. Applicant would visit his in-laws every three to six \nmonths.  \n \nOn his next trip to his in-laws, he took another pill. On following trips he would \ntake one, two, or three pills. (Tr. 34) This progressed to the point where he was taking \nhome handfuls of the pills. (Tr. 35) He never asked for the pills, but simply knew where \nthey were stored in the medicine cabinet. (Tr. 86) Applicant possessed a security \nclearance while taking the drugs. (Tr. 48) \n \nFor two years in 1997 through 1999 (Tr. 149), Applicant attended Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) and stop drinking for a few months at a time. He was encouraged to \ngo because his wife and mother told him he was drinking too much and had an alcohol \nproblem. (Tr. 36, 72, 105) He would go three months without alcohol. Then he would \nvisit his in-laws, get new pills and start drinking again. (Tr. 156) When taking the pills, \nApplicant did not drink as much. (Tr. 36) His drinking increased when he ran out of the \npills. This pattern continued for 18 months to 2 years. (Tr. 157) \n \nIn 1999, at his child\u2019s birthday party, Applicant passed out in a chair due to his \nTylox and Valium usage and efforts to wake him failed. Applicant\u2019s wife and her parents \nconfronted him and forced him to seek help. They were concerned about his drinking \nprior the incident. (Tr. 36) At that time, Applicant believed he was an alcoholic. (Tr. 38) \nAt the hearing, he no longer believes he is an alcoholic, but considers himself to have a \nlifelong \u201cpredisposition for alcohol/prescription drug dependency.\u201d (Ex 2, page II \u2013 3, Tr. \n95, 122) He currently believes he is not an alcoholic because he is not addicted to \nalcohol. (Tr. 122) \n \nFrom July 1999 through September 1999, Applicant attended alcohol and drug \noutpatient treatment for his abuse of Tylox, Valium, and alcohol. He attended outpatient \ntreatment three hours a day, three times a week. Applicant found this program to be \nextremely successful. He was highly motivated because he was \u201csick and tired\u201d of being \n\u201csick and tired.\u201d During the first two-weeks of treatment he underwent daily urinalysis, \nwhich continued to be positive for drug use. (Tr. 37) Applicant claims he had stopped \nhis drug usage. (Ex. 2) Applicant\u2019s insurance refuse to pay for continued treatment so \nApplicant paid $1,500 to complete the eight week program. (Ex 2, Tr. 37) Applicant \nstopped drinking the six months he was in and following treatment. (Tr. 44) For three to \nfour months following treatment, Applicant went to AA, where he would introduce \nhimself as an alcoholic. (Tr. 74)  \n \nFor about 18 months, his job was not going well. He was getting depressed, \neating too much, getting little exercise, and gaining weight. (Tr. 38) From August 2003 \n\n \n \n \n4\nto November 2006, he was treated for depression, insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, and \nalcoholism. (Tr. 39-40) At that time, he requested a prescription for Antabuse. It was not \nuntil early 2007, after he had completed his SF 86, that he learned the diagnosis \nincluded treatment for alcoholism. (Tr. 40) After learning he had been diagnosed as \nsuffering from alcoholism he never confronted his doctor about the diagnosis. (Tr. 96, \n133) Applicant disagrees with the diagnosis of alcoholism, but says his doctor is entitled \nto his expert opinion. (Tr. 97) Applicant has seen this doctor for four and a half years. \n(Tr. 98) His doctor told him he need to cut down on his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 105)  \n \n \nEight or nine years ago, in 1998 or 1999, Applicant had four beers with a late \nlunch, not intending to return to work, but then did return to turn off his computer. (Tr. \n120) He talked with a co-worker who turned him in when she smelled alcohol on him. \n(Ex. 2)  \n \nIn 1994, Applicant began taking Paxil for depression anxiety attacks. (Tr. 65-66) \nApplicant\u2019s first suffered from anxiety when he was working on his senior project in \ncollege and thought he was going to die. (Tr. 139) He thought he was having a heart \nattack. The first attack was followed almost continuously by anxiety attacks for a six \nmonth period. (Tr. 141) In 2001, he had a hypermanic episode. He felt great, felt happy, \nbut could not sleep. (Tr. 61) His thoughts would race. He lost 20 pounds; he suffered \nfrom anxiety attacks for six months that left him unable to think. From late 2001 to \nAugust 2003, he was treated for depression and received one week inpatient treatment. \n(Ex 1, page 29, Tr. 63, 66) In 2004, he started taking a sleep aid twice a week. (Tr. 59-\n60)  \n \nIn 2005, Applicant felt it was safe to resume drinking. However, in October 2005, \nhe was arrested for public intoxication. He was away from home performing business \nrelated activities. The work was done and he had a late morning flight home the next \nday. He parked his rental car at the hotel and walked to a restaurant bar near the hotel \nwhere he intended to have a few drinks following dinner. (Tr. 46)  \n \nAfter eating, Applicant spent the night in the restaurant\u2019s bar with some people \nhe had just met. The evening started out well with Applicant buying rounds of drinks for \nthem. During the evening, he had six to eight Long Island Iced Teas. (Tr. 113) Applicant \nacknowledged he \u201cdid have a lot to drink\u201d that evening. (Tr. 47) Those he was with \u201chad \ngotten pretty drunk.\u201d (Tr. 114) The people turned hostile, got angry at him, and he left. \n(Tr. 46) He thought they were going to harm him, so he paid his bill, and quickly left the \nrestaurant bar. Upon leaving, he did not return to his hotel, but saw a police officer in \nthe parking lot and sought the officer\u2019s protection. The officer noticed Applicant\u2019s \nintoxicated state and arrested him for public intoxication and took Applicant to the police \nstation. (Tr. 47) No chemical test was given to prove intoxication; however, Applicant \nfreely admitted he was intoxicated. (Tr. 139) He paid a $90 fine.  \n \n \nApplicant maintains a prescription of Antabuse as a precautionary measure in \ncase he believes his drinking is becoming excessive or should he wish to avoid drinking \nfor special situations. He has used 30 tablets every two to three years. (Ex. 2) He last \nhad his prescription filled a year ago. (Tr. 70, 145)  \n\n \n \n \n5\n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant completed written interrogatories. (Ex. 2) He \nstated over the past month he was drinking a quart of beer every other night. He also \nstated there were several months when he consumed three to five drinks at one time. \n(Ex. 2, Tr. 119) He acknowledged there were times during the past years when he \ndrank for entire weekends or had six to eight drinks every day for two or three weeks in \na row. (Ex. 2, Tr. 119)  \n \n \nApplicant stated he was getting mildly intoxicated at least two or three times a \nweek after having consumed two or three beers. (Ex. 2, Tr. 119) Applicant states he \nwas last intoxicate a year ago. In September 2007, following the receipt of the written \ninterrogatories, Applicant stopped drinking. (Tr. 43) At Thanksgiving, he resumed \ndrinking. He is not sure but believes he may have gotten intoxicated during Christmas \ntime 2006. (Tr. 57) In the summer of 2006, he remembers being drunk. (Tr. 56, 121) He \nknows he is drunk when the room starts spinning and he starts to feel sick. (Tr. 58) \nApplicant stated: \n \nI mean, I don\u2019t worry about my drinking too much, but, I mean, I \noccasionally drink too much, you know. So there\u2019s always the possibility \nthat if I start to drink too much, then I\u2019ll get myself into trouble. I worry \nabout that. (Tr. 127)  \n \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant met with his doctor who provided a letter (Ex C) \nstating the doctor he saw no evidence of alcohol problems in recent years and thought \nApplicant should be granted a clearance. The doctor has not seen the SOR. (Tr. 125) \nApplicant did not tell his doctor about his October 2005 arrest for public intoxication, \nbeing intoxicated in the summer of 2006, or at Christmas time 2006. (Tr. 133) Since \nJune 2007, Applicant had seen the doctor once before requesting the letter.  \n \n \nIn January 2008, following the receipt of the SOR, Applicant renewed his \nintention to stop drinking. (Tr. 108) Applicant had been unaware of the gravity of his \nalcohol use until the hearing. (Tr. 160) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n \n \n6\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and has a problem with alcohol consumption for 20 to \n25 years. In 1985, Applicant, then age 17, was found guilty of DUI. In 1999, he attended \nan alcohol and drug outpatient treatment program. Applicant has been diagnosed as an \nalcoholic. In 2005, he was arrested for public intoxication. He has frequently drunk to \nthe point of intoxication. The last time he was intoxicated was Christmas time 2006. AG \n\u00b6 22 (a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \n\n \n \n \n7\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22 (c) \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the \npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d apply.  \n \nEight or nine years ago, Applicant returned to work after a late lunch to turn off \nhis computer and was confronted by a co-worker when she smelled alcohol on \nApplicant. Applicant had drunk alcohol during lunch, but the record is insufficient to \nestablish he reported for work intoxicated or in an impaired conditions. AG \u00b6 22 (b) \n\u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or \nimpaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d does not apply. I find for \nApplicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \nI do not find it a security concern that Applicant has a proscription for Antabuse, \nbut is not currently using the medication. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.d. \n \nAt age 24, Applicant knew he was drinking too much and sought Antabuse from \nhis uncle to help him with his problem. The six months before his 1992 wedding he did \nnot drink. However, his sobriety did not continue. For an 18 month to 2 year period from \nApril 1995 until July 1999, he illegally used the prescription drugs of Tylox and Valium \napproximately several dozen times and drank excessively, while possessing a security \nclearance. His abuse started slowly when his mother-in-law offered him Tylox and \nValium for a head ache. His use continued to the point where he was taking home \nhandfuls of the pills. His drinking increased when he ran out of pills. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, in-laws, and mother told him he was drinking too much. From \n1997 through 1999, he received some help through AA and would stop drinking for a \nfew months at a time. The he would return to his in-laws, obtain more drugs, and the \ncycle would start again. The matter came to a head at in 1999 at a birthday party. He \nhad taken Tylox and Valium, passed out, and could not be woken up. At that time, he \nbelieved he was an alcoholic. He no longer believes he is an alcoholic, but considers \nhimself to have a lifelong \u201cpredisposition for alcohol/prescription drug dependency.\u201d  \n \nFor six months following treatment, Applicant abstained from alcohol usage. \nHowever, in 2005 Applicant believed it was safe to drink again. In October 2005, having \nfinished his work, Applicant went to a restaurant bar with the intention of having a few \ndrinks. Over the course of the evening, he drank too much and admits he was \nintoxicated. When he sought protection from a police officer he was arrested, taken to \nthe police station, and later fined for public intoxication. \n \nApplicant\u2019s doctor diagnosed Applicant as suffering from alcoholism. Since \nlearning of the diagnosis, Applicant has not asked his doctor about the diagnosis. \nApplicant believes the diagnosis is wrong, but believes his doctor is entitled to his expert \nopinion. His doctor had told Applicant to reduce his drinking. Applicant supplied a letter \nfrom his doctor stating his doctor had seen no evidence of an alcohol problem in recent \nyears and believed Applicant should receive a clearance. However, Applicant never told \n\n \n \n \n8\nhis doctor of his October 2005 arrest for public intoxication. Each time Applicant saw his \ndoctor, his doctor asked him about his alcohol usage, but Applicant did not think it \nimportant to tell his doctor about his arrest.  \n \nApplicant never told his doctor he had been intoxicated during the summer of \n2006 and during Christmas time 2006. Nor did Applicant show his doctor the SOR. \nThere is no evidence his doctor ever changed his diagnosis that Applicant suffered from \nalcoholism. \n \nEven though Applicant attended an alcohol and drug outpatient treatment in 1999 \nand was diagnosed by his treating doctor with alcoholism there is no diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. Therefore, AG \u00b6 22 (d) \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22 (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d do not apply. Without a diagnosis of alcohol \nabuse or dependence, AG \u00b6 22 (f) \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or \ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d can not apply.  \n \nNone of the mitigating factors listed in AG \u00b6 23 apply. Applicant last drank \nalcohol the end of December 2007. In his past, Applicant had frequently experienced \nperiods of abstinence last from three or four months before resuming his drinking. At the \ntime of the hearing, it had been three months since his last drink. It is too early to predict \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol problem is a thing of the past. He was last intoxicated during \nChristmas time 2006. AG \u00b6 23(a) \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d does not apply because his usage is recent, it was not infrequent, nor did it \nhappen under unusual circumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 23 (b) \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser),\u201d does not apply because Applicant fails to acknowledge his alcoholism. \nHe once thought his was an alcoholic and for two years introduced himself at AA \nmeetings as an alcoholic, he now does not think he is an alcoholic because he does not \nbelieve he is addicted to alcohol. He believes he suffers from a lifelong \u201cpredisposition \nfor alcohol/prescription drug dependency.\u201d He currently does not worry too much about \nhis drinking.  \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 23 (c) \u201cthe individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress\u201d nor AG \u00b6 (d) \u201cthe individual has successfully completed \ninpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of \nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis \n\n \n \n \n9\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d apply. There is no favorable \nprognosis. His doctor\u2019s letter is undercut by his doctor\u2019s lack of knowledge of Applicant\u2019s \ndrinking, intoxications, and 2005 arrest for public intoxication.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant abused Tylox and Valium for an 18 month to 2 year period when he \nheld a security clearance. Additionally, the alcohol problems listed above are alleged \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 16 conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include AG \u00b6 16 (d) \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations,\u201d apply to the drug abuse. None of the mitigating conditions \nset forth in AG \u00b6 17 apply. I find against Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2 b. \n \nSince the alcohol problems are specifically covered by Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption, I find Guideline E, personal conduct, does not apply to the alcohol \nallegations. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2 a. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n \n10\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 40 years old and has \nhad problems with excessive alcohol consumption for 20 to 25 of those years. Others \nhave told him he was drinking too much. At times, Applicant believed he was drinking \ntoo much and took steps to stop drinking. Each time he stopped, he would eventually \nreturn to excessive alcohol consumption. He once thought he was an alcoholic, but now \nbelieves he has a lifelong \u201cpredisposition for alcohol/prescription drug dependency.\u201d His \ndoctor thinks him an alcoholic, but Applicant never questioned his doctor about the \ndiagnosis and believes the doctor is entitled to his opinion even though it is wrong. If \nApplicant does not believe he had a problem he is unlikely to correct it.  \n \nAt that time of the hearing, Applicant had abstained from alcohol for three \nmonths. I give little weight to this because Applicant has abstained from alcohol in the \npast only to return to excessive alcohol consumption. I also give little weight to \nApplicant\u2019s doctor\u2019s most recent letter, because the doctor did not know about  \nApplicant\u2019s most recent incidents of excessive alcohol consumption and it is unclear \nwhat material formed the basis of the letter.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant not mitigated the security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G, Alcohol : \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n11\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal \nConduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn March 4, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 29, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on May 7, 2008. Applicant received the \nFORM on May 16, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. On July 22, \n2008, DOHA assigned the case to me. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations under \nGuideline F, Guideline E, and Guideline J. \n  \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and separated from her husband. She has a 20-year old \ndaughter. Since March 2005, she has worked as a Mess Attendant for a federal \ncontractor. She worked as a cashier at a retail store from October until March 2005, and \nwas unemployed from October 2001 to October 2004. Prior to being unemployed, she \nwas a Runner for a private company for almost two years. From January 1997 to \nFebruary 2000, she was unemployed.

In response to Sections 27d., 28a., and \n28b., concerning unpaid judgments, delinquent debts over 180 days in the last 7 years, \nand debts over 90 days delinquent, she responded \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose a \njudgment and numerous delinquent debts. (Item 3). \n \n \nDuring an interview in March 2007, in which she reviewed a credit bureau report, \nApplicant stated that some of the debts arose because her husband was incarcerated \ntwice over a couple years for alcohol related crimes and was unemployed. She did not \nrecognize some of the debts and ignored others because she does not have the money \nto pay them. Since her husband moved out of their home, his income is no longer \navailable to pay bills. Her net monthly income is $1,700 and her expenses total that and \npossibly more. (Item 9). \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she deliberately supplied incorrect information on the e-\nQIP regarding her finances, because she wanted to obtain a security clearance so she \ncould maintain her position. (Item 9).   \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated September 29, 2006, October 3, \n2007, and January 11, 2008, Paragraph 1 of the SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts, \nincluding one judgment, totaling $17,481, which began accruing in 2001.  All of the \ndebts remain unpaid or unresolved, except SOR \u00b6 1.q for $161.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a) \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise \nsecurity concerns. Based on three CBRs and her statements, Applicant has been \nunable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing in 2001. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated \nwhere Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies \nare numerous and have been ongoing since 2001. Hence, this condition does not apply.   \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant stated that her \nhusband was incarcerated for periods of time, which reduced the family\u2019s income. She \nwas also unemployed for long stretches of time. Both circumstances were beyond her \ncontrol. However, there is no evidence in the record indicating that she responsibly \nmanaged her finances during those difficult periods, which is necessary for full \napplication of this mitigating condition. Thus, AG & 20(b) has limited application.    \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not present any evidence that \n\n \n5 \n \n \nshe received credit counseling and/or that her financial problems are under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ According to the record, only one small debt is paid, and all other debts \nremain unpaid or unresolved; hence, AG & 20(d) does not apply. There is no evidence \nindicating that she disputed any of the debts, which is necessary to trigger the \napplication of AG & 20(e) that applies when \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  The record does not support the application of AG & \n20(f) \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\u201d    \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR that Applicant falsified her answers \nto three questions on the e-QIP, because she failed to disclose specific delinquent \ndebts and a judgment. The Government contended that those omissions may raise a \nsecurity concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation and explained that she falsified her application \nbecause she wanted to obtain a security clearance in order to maintain her job. \nBased on the evidence, the Government established said disqualification.  \nApplicant did not provide any evidence that would trigger the application of any  \nmitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to criminal \nconduct: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of her e-QIP \nconstitutes a violation of federal law, specifically, Title 18, United States Code, Section \n1001, and raises a disqualification under AG \u00b6 31.  Based on the finding under \nGuideline E that Applicant intentionally falsified the e-QIP, the Government established \nthe disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d None of the criminal conduct mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 31 is \napplicable because Applicant failed to sufficiently address or provide mitigating \nevidence that would warrant the application of any of the five conditions.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 40 years old. She has a \nhistory of being unable to meet her bills. Her husband\u2019s legal and alcohol issues \napparently have contributed to those problems. At this time, she did not produce any \nevidence that she has attempted to manage her finances. Without proof that she has \nestablished a plan to resolve her outstanding delinquent debts and a budget to manage \nher finances, similar problems are likely to occur in the future. Although she forthrightly \nadmitted that she did not disclose her financial delinquencies to the Government \nbecause she feared she would lose her employment, there is insufficient information in \nthe record to mitigate the personal conduct concern at this time. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial issues, personal conduct, \nand criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.p:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r and 1.s: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  \nEligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 20, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan e-QIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On December \n21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge \nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nJune 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 16, 2008.1 In a sworn, \nwritten statement, notarized February 2, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. However, on February 13, 2008, pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7., Enclosure 3 of the \nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, Department Counsel requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on February 14, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 15, 2008. Applicant was unavailable to attend a hearing tentatively scheduled \nfor mid-March 2008, so a Notice of Hearing was issued on March 31, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on May 7, 2008. \n \nDuring the hearing, nine Government exhibits and seven Applicant exhibits were \nreceived without objection, and Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \nwas received on May 16, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted seven of the factual allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g. through 1.m. of the SOR.  He denied all other allegations with explanations.  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance. He was previously granted a SECRET clearance in \nDecember 1981, and access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in \nSeptember 1992,2 and has retained his clearance and access through periodic \nreinvestigations.  He was married to his first wife from 1986 until her death in 2003, and \nmarried his current spouse in 2004. He has two children and two step-children. \n \nApplicant earned a B.S. in Electronic Engineering in 1982, and as of February \n2006, was still entered in a program leading to an M.S. in Engineering Management, \nalthough he has not taken a class since late 2002. From March 1994 until the present, \nApplicant has been gainfully employed, initially as a software engineer and currently as \na senior staff software engineer, by a major defense contractor and its successor.3  He \n \n1 Applicant erroneously wrote the date as 2007. \n \n2 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated Feb. 20, 2006), at  8-9. \n \n3 Id. at 3. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nis highly respected by management and co-workers for his character, trustworthiness, \nand integrity. \n \nWithout his knowledge, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties actually commenced \nwhen he followed his father\u2019s recommendation to invest in a limited partnership \nbusiness venture involving genetic engineering of cattle in about 1982.4  At the time he \nentered into the venture, the U.S. Government was offering tax incentives for such \ninvestments.5  Applicant believes there were approximately 4,000 initial investors in the \nventure.6 He invested several thousand dollars on an annual basis, and when he filed \nhis state and federal income tax returns, reviewed by both an accountant and an \nattorney,7 claimed the appropriate business deductions, resulting in tax credits or \nbusiness losses.8  Those credits and losses off set income taxes on his other sources of \nincome, including his salary, and he received refunds of all taxes previously withheld \nbased on his salary.9 For an unspecified period, Applicant claimed to be exempt and \nthat claim resulted in having no income taxes withheld from his salary.10  However, at \nsome point, believed by Applicant to have been in about 1986-87, the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) informed him that the claim of exemption was not appropriate so he \nincreased his exemptions.11 \n \n The IRS eventually notified the investors that it would disallow all partnership \ndeductions.12 That notice was followed up by investigations of the venture by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).13 Despite the controversy, he was advised by \npersons unspecified that the partnership attorneys and the IRS would eventually settle \n \n \n4 Government Exhibit 8 (Statement of Subject, dated Jul. 19, 1995), at 1; But see also Answer to SOR, \ndated Jan. 29, 2008, at 1, wherein Applicant claims he started investing in 1978, while still in college.  During the \nhearing, Applicant stated his father had started investing in the venture in the mid-1970s. (Tr. at 27)  While the \nspecific date is not material, the facts supporting the later date are: (1) Applicant furnished the 1982 date in 1995, \nwhich was only 13 years after the fact, while the 1978 date was furnished in 2008, or approximately 30 years after the \nfact; and (2) in 1995, the IRS challenged the business deductions commencing in 1982, and did not go back to an \nearlier date.  \n   \n5 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 4, at 1. \n \n6 Id. at 2; Tr. at 28. \n \n7 Answer to SOR, supra note 4, at 1. \n \n8 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 4, at 1-2. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Id. at 2. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 Id. \n \n13 Id. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthe matter.14 Nevertheless, litigation ensued involving other partners, but Applicant was \nnot a party. Based on the advice of Applicant\u2019s attorney, both Applicant and his father \nceased their respective investments in the venture in about 1991-92.15 \n \nTax audits conducted by the IRS resulted in all of Applicant\u2019s previous venture-\nrelated deductions being denied, and he was assessed large accumulated interest and \npenalty balances for the tax years 1982 through 1986.16 Large deficiencies were also \nproposed for the tax years 1987 through 1995.17 In 1995, federal and state tax liens \nwere placed against his property on several occasions, and the IRS levied his wages \nand a savings account.18 Because of the loss of salary and savings, through \ngarnishment or levy, to offset his tax deficiencies, he began to experience substantial \nfinancial difficulties and used credit cards to meet living expenses.19 \n \nApplicant subsequently sold stock to pay off some credit cards20 and, to resolve \na tax issue with the state, voluntarily agreed to the sale of a timeshare to satisfy the \nbalance.21 He also cooperated with the IRS, and by a combination of agreed payment \narrangements, and relatively recent overpaid income taxes which would be applied to \nhis unpaid balances, he has been addressing them as well.22  Despite his financial \ndifficulties, Applicant has managed to remain current in all his other accounts.23  \n \nAlthough some of the issues regarding the limited partnership were before the \nU.S. Tax Court, the matter was subsequently dismissed.  Applicant\u2019s attorney advised \nhim the IRS had decided not to pursue the matter any further, and the liens had \nexpired.24   \n \nThe SOR identified 13 allegations, including 10 which purportedly refer to \ncontinuing delinquencies. Applicant contends several of the allegations refer to tax liens \n \n14 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 4, at 1. \n \n15 Answer to SOR, supra note 4, at 1; Tr. at 28. \n \n16 Government Exhibit 9 (Statement, dated Aug. 8, 1996), at 1. \n \n17 Government Exhibit 8, supra note 4, at 3. \n \n18 Government Exhibit 2 (Attachments 1-4 Notices of Federal Tax Lien, various dates), Answers to \nInterrogatories, dated Oct. 1, 2007); Government Exhibit 7 (State Notification of Tax Lien, dated Mar. 7, 1995); \nGovernment Exhibit 9, supra note 16, at 2; Answer to SOR, supra note 4, at 1. \n \n19 Government Exhibit 9, supra note 16, at 2-3. \n \n20 Id. at 2. \n \n21 Answer to SOR, supra note 4, at 2. \n \n22 Id. at 1. \n \n23 Id. at 2. \n \n24 Id. at 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nwhich were, in his opinion, not legitimate because the lien had expired or the balance \nhad been paid off.

Equifax furnished a 2007 Credit Report46 and a 2008 Credit Report.47 While both \ncredit reports list the same five \u201ccurrent\u201d liens and one released lien, the information \nappearing in the credit reports is inaccurate and incomplete. Moreover, the LexisNexis\u00ae \nInternet search revealed only the most superficial information about five federal tax \nliens, but fails to furnish the most salient of information: (1) what was the basis for the \nlien, and (2) what is the current status of the lien. \n \nApplicant remains within a budget,48 and generally has a monthly balance of \nabout $3,126.00 in discretionary funds available for his use.49  His most recent federal \nincome tax filing is anticipated to result in a refund of about $9,000.50 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n \n45Government Exhibit 3 (LexisNexis\u00ae Internet Search, dated Dec. 12, 2007). \n \n46 Government Exhibit 5, dated Dec. 11, 2007). \n \n47 Government Exhibit 4, dated Feb. 14, 2008. \n \n48 Government Exhibit 2 (Attachment 10 \u2013 Personal Financial Statement, undated), supra note 18, \n \n49 Id. \n \n50 Applicant Exhibit G (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return 2007 (Form 1040), undated), at 2. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \n51 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Also, AG & 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as \nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust,\u201d  \n(emphasis supplied) and AG & 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of same\u201d may raise security \nconcerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to substantiate the debts and delinquencies \nset forth in each of the SOR allegations.  \n \nWithout much warning, following tax audits, the IRS \u201chit\u201d Applicant with \nsubstantial income tax, penalties, and interest because of his involvement in a \npreviously approved investment in a limited partnership business venture which the IRS \nsubsequently disallowed. Because of a dispute as to the IRS action, and listening to the \nlegal advice of his attorney, the investment advice of the managing partners, and \nawaiting a decision by the U.S. Tax Court \u2013 a decision which never materialized \nbecause the litigation was dismissed \u2013 Applicant initially took no action in addressing \nthe IRS actions. As a result of his initial inaction, the balances grew, wage garnishments \nwere executed, and tax liens were filed. In one instance during this entire situation, but \nunrelated to it, Applicant overlooked the taxes on a timeshare. When it became \napparent the IRS position would not change, Applicant was not immediately able to \nsatisfy the demanded balances, and his delay in commencing to make payments on \nthose balances constitute both an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and a history \nof not meeting financial obligations. The above actions are sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  \n \nThe issue pertaining to the federal and state tax liens is a different matter.  The \nfederal and state tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS in 1995-96, and some \nof the federal tax liens were refiled in 1998. There is no evidence to establish a failure \nby Applicant to file annual income tax returns as required in AG & 19(g), and the \nevidence supports the opposite conclusion. Likewise, in the absence of a scintilla of \nevidence indicating any criminal action by Applicant, his actions in taking the business \ndeductions, resulting in tax credits or business losses, and setting off income taxes on \nhis other sources of income, does not constitute a \u201cfraudulent filing\u201d of income tax \nreturns or \u201cincome tax evasion.\u201d Moreover, the state income tax liens covering 1983-86, \nand the state tax deficiency for the timeshare were released or otherwise satisfied in \n1999-2000.  The federal tax liens covering 1986, 1993, and 1994, as well as the tax \ndeficiencies covering 1992-94, and 1999, were all satisfied in 2006.  The federal tax \nliens covering 1982-85 were to have expired several years ago and Applicant was \nconvinced they had expired so he took no action on them.  They were actually refiled in \n1998. Applicant has now realized his error and is prepared to continue his efforts to \nsatisfy those liens, but he has been advised by his attorney that the IRS is expected to \nallow the liens to expire in December 2008 without further action.  I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply in this case.  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances\u201d may raise security concerns as well. \n \nApplicant=s initial participation in the business venture commenced because of \nthe advice and guidance he had received from his father and an attorney, as well as \nbased on the information he had received from the managing partners.  Finally, after the \nIRS had altered its original position regarding the venture, and once again relying on the \nadvice he received from his father and an attorney, his participation ceased in about \n1991-92, and has not been resumed.  Given Applicant\u2019s harsh lesson learned, and the \nmoney his investments have cost him, I find the behavior is unlikely to recur, and it does \nnot raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). In this instance, there is clear evidence of \nApplicant having received counseling for his financial issues from his father and his \nattorney, as well as experience gathered from the IRS interpretation and guidance of \nthe law. Moreover, based on his actions, and elimination of the business venture from \nhis continuing activities, there are clear indications that his financial issues have been \nresolved, are being resolved, or are under control.  He no longer has anything to do with \nthe venture and has tried to put the experience behind him. \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@52 As noted \nabove, Applicant sold stock to pay off some credit cards and, to resolve a tax issue with \nthe state, sold a timeshare to generate enough money to satisfy the balance owed. He \n \n52 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nalso cooperated with the IRS, and by a combination of agreed payment arrangements, \nand overpaid income taxes to be applied to his unpaid balances, he began addressing \nthem as well. To his credit, despite his investment-related financial difficulties, Applicant \nhas managed to remain current in all his other accounts, and currently generally has a \nmonthly balance of about $3,126 in discretionary funds available for his use. He \nanticipated a $9,000 refund from his most recent income tax filing. While there is still a \npending federal tax lien covering the years 1982-85, he is clearly on his way to resolving \nhis financial delinquencies and has made tremendous strides in doing so. His actions in \naddressing his debts indicate good-faith efforts on his part as well as showing clear \nindications the problem is now largely under control.  I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply \nin this case. \n \nUnder AG & 20(e), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.\u201d What was once \na legally acceptable business venture in the eyes of the IRS became an unacceptable \nbusiness venture. The U.S. Tax Court became involved, but the litigation was \ndismissed. Applicant was advised that the venture was legal, and then advised the \ncontroversy would be settled. Consistent with the guidance he received from various \nquarters, Applicant believed the tax liens were not legitimate, and he stood his ground.  \nHowever, he has now accepted the newly revised reality.  He has provided written \nstatements and testimony describing his actions and the result of those actions. I have \nconsidered his oral and written statements and examined his demeanor, and consider \nhim to be candid, truthful, and credible.  In these particular circumstances, he acted \nresponsibly. I find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies in this case.  \n \nIt appears several of the SOR allegations duplicate other allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n($159,621) refers to the tax years 1982-85. SOR \u00b6 1.c. ($31,129) refers to the tax year \n1982, which is also part of the other lien. SOR \u00b6 1.d. ($76,216) refers to 1983-85, which \nis also included in the first lien. SOR \u00b6 1.i. ($112,450) refers to a federal wage \ngarnishment on the large amount covering several of the same tax years, plus 1986, but \nthe garnishment was cancelled after $1,000 was taken. By alleging each of the above \namounts separately, without specifying the individual tax years involved, or by failing to \nacknowledge payments already made or resulting official actions already taken, such as \nrelease of liens or cancellation of garnishments, the balance owed is made to appear \nconsiderably larger than the true balance. Furthermore, the general lack of specificity or \naccuracy in the allegations fail to furnish full notice to Applicant and merely serve to \nconfuse the issues. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. On the recommendations of his \nfather, counseling by an attorney, and with the guidance that the investment was \nlegitimate, Applicant participated in the venture. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) Upon learning of \nthe revised IRS position regarding the investment, and with the advice of an attorney, \nApplicant ceased his participation in the venture in about 1991-92. (See AG & 2(a)(3).) \nSince undergoing tax audits, and having federal and state tax liens filed and \ngarnishments established, he has taken affirmative action and made substantial good-\nfaith efforts to pay off or resolve his debts. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it is true there are \nstill liens covering the tax years 1982-85, those liens did not result in a current levy and, \nwhile the liens were refiled in 1998, they are expected to expire in December 2008 \nwithout further IRS action, making the amounts specified uncollectible. (See AG & \n2(a)(8).) Thus, these debts cannot be sources of improper pressure or duress.  Finally, \nbecause of the lessons learned, and considering his monetary losses, the behavior is \nunlikely to recur.  (See AG & 2(a)(9).) \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether his \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence.53 Considering his continuing good-faith efforts, the circumstances behind the \nliens and garnishments, the duplication of some of those debts in the SOR, his \ncontinuing to receive and hold a security clearance and access to SCI throughout this \nentire financial situation without cause for alarm, and his current financial status \nregarding other accounts which never fell into delinquency, his past financial situation, \nand to a degree, the present federal tax liens which are about to expire, is insufficient to \nraise continuing security concerns.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR\nthat was received by DOHA on December 26, 2007. He admitted all allegations except\nthose contained in subparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, and 1.i, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 18, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non January 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 20, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 24, 2008\n\n2\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified, called one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted eight\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-8, and admitted into\nthe record without objection. The record was held open to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documents in support of his case. One additional document was timely received,\nmarked as AE 9, and admitted into the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s\nforwarding endorsement on AE 9 was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and\nincluded as part of the record. The transcript was received on February 28, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 41 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor as a\nsenior programmer analyst since July 2004. He was previously employed by another\ncompany, but working with his present employer under contract, from November 2000 to\nJune 2004. Applicant has been married since March 1996. He does not have any children.\nApplicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s joint family income was between $225,000 and $250,000\nannually before she lost her job in August 2001. Her portion of that income was about\n$150,000. She remained unemployed until August 2002, when she was hired at a salary\nof $60,000 annually. Having established a lifestyle based upon their greatly increased\nfamily income, Applicant and his wife depleted their savings and retirement accounts\nduring her period of unemployment in an effort to maintain that lifestyle. \nApplicant\u2019s wife again became unemployed in 2004, at which time they began to fall\nbehind in payments on their various debts. She has since then been working on\nestablishing a cosmetic business and selling items at flea markets which are only\ngenerating a net monthly income of about $500. Further complicating their financial\nsituation was the need to let a young teenage nephew come and live with them from 2006\nto 2007 in accord with a court order to keep him from being sentenced to a term in jail. His\npresence in the home prevented Applicant\u2019s wife from seeking full-time employment and\nalso prevented them from moving into a smaller and less expensive apartment as they had\npreviously planned on doing. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s unemployment and the resulting severe decrease in family income\nresulted in numerous debts, primarily consisting of revolving credit, becoming delinquent.\nHe contacted a credit consumer counseling service in an attempt to resolve his delinquent\ndebts, but was unable to make the $1,900 monthly payments they were going to require\nfrom him.\nBefore the SOR was filed, DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories inquiring about the\ndebts that were subsequently listed in the SOR and others. Applicant responded to the\ninterrogatories on October 4, 2007, and provided proof that three debts, totaling $1,090,\nhad been paid. He submitted proof with his answer to the SOR that two additional debts,\ntotaling $5,570, had been satisfied. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n3\nThe Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Applicant\u2019s employer testified on\nhis behalf. He described Applicant as a meticulous individual, an outstanding employee,\nand a \u201cstand-up\u201d guy. Applicant informed his employer of the pending hearing on the SOR\nand the basis for the denial of his security clearance about two weeks before the hearing.\nAt the employers suggestion, a $30,000 loan was made to Applicant by the employer at\n5% annual interest to be repaid in 98 bi-monthly installments of $345.10 to be withheld\ndirectly from his salary. The employer made the loan because it\u2019s officers believe Applicant\nis a valued employee who they trust to repay the loan in accordance with the agreed\ncontractual terms or sooner.\nApplicant applied the proceeds of the loan to satisfy all delinquent debt alleged in\nthe SOR with the exception of a debt owing in the amount of $12,154 to a collection\nagency. Applicant testified he was reluctant to contact this creditor directly, as he had the\ncreditors who he has satisfied, because of the abundance of negative information he\nlearned about this creditor through an internet search. He testified he instead opted to act\nthrough an attorney with this creditor. In his post-hearing submission (AE 9), Applicant\nstated the attorney told him to try and negotiate with that creditor directly, that he did so but\nwas unsuccessful in arranging an agreed settlement with that creditor, and he intends to\nresolve the account in the upcoming months with the assistance of the attorney.   \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case.\n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG]) 18\nApplicant\u2019s severe and unexpected decrease in family income from August 2001 to\nAugust 2002, and again since 2004 caused a number of his debts to become delinquent.\nDisqualifying Conditions DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 19(a):\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts apply. \nApplicant and his wife lived within their financial means before she lost her job in\nAugust 2001. They acted responsibly by applying their savings to maintain their lifestyle\nwhile she searched for new employment. Having expended all their savings, they found\nthemselves in a position where they could not service all their credit card debt when she\nagain became unemployed in 2004. The need to take their nephew into their home further\naggravated their financial position and prohibited them from taking more immediate steps\nto begin to resolve their financial distress.  \nApplicant satisfied several delinquent accounts even before the SOR was issued.\nAt his employer\u2019s suggestion, he has obtained a loan that has allowed him to satisfy all\n\n5\nremaining delinquent creditors with the exception of one. He has consulted with an attorney\nabout that debt and credibly asserted that with the attorney\u2019s assistance the debt will be\nsatisfied in the not too distant future. The loan he obtained from his employer is being\nrepaid over the course of the next four years at a modest interest rate by withholding a\nrelatively small sum from Applicant\u2019s salary. \n \nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 20(b):\nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances; 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and\n20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts all apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, specifically to include the trust and confidence his employer\ndemonstrated in Applicant by making a loan to him at its suggestion and with full\nknowledge of the reason and need for the loan,  the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6\nof the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has\nmitigated the financial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against\nhim and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-i:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt that \nhe has been unable to pay for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose around 2001 and continue into 2007. Hence, they are ongoing \nand this condition cannot apply.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant noted that \nsome of his debts arose as a result of his father\u2019s death. However, he did not present \nevidence indicating what he took steps to manage them during that time frame. I find \nthis potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not present any evidence of credit counseling or \ndocumentation of efforts to resolve the delinquent debts, either by payment or \nsettlement. He did not submit any evidence that he is financially sound and able to \nmanage his debt. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 56 year old man, \nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for managing his finances and incurring debt. \nHe has a long work history with his current employer and has held a security clearance \nfor a number of years. While he is not required to be debt free, he is expected to \nmanage his finances in such a way as to meet his obligations. In this case, Applicant did \nnot present any evidence that he has taken steps to resolve and responsibly manage \nhis finances and debts, despite being on notice of the problem for some time. Without \nan established budget and a track record of consistent financial management \ndemonstrating reliability and good judgment, I am concerned that his financial problems \nwill recontinue.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on \nSeptember 6, 2006. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApril 15, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 7, 2007, and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on February 6, 2008, and I received the case assignment on \nFebruary 14, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 21, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for March 13, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which \nwere received without objection. The Government also offered a \u201cdemonstrative \naid,\u201d which was marked Exhibit (Ex.) I without objection. Applicant did not offer \nany exhibits during his hearing, but did testify on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until March 21, 2008 to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE A \nthrough L without objection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel \nby Memorandum dated March 25, 2008 (Ex. II). DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on March 21, 2008. The record closed on March 25, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanation except for \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old security officer, who has worked for a \nGovernment contractor since December 2007. Tr. 15, 88-89, GE 1. He seeks a \nsecurity clearance in conjunction with his employment. Tr. 15. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1990. Tr. 14, 84-85. He \nserved in the U.S. Army from June 1990 to June 1999, and was honorably \ndischarged as a sergeant/pay grade E-5. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve \nfrom June 1999 to August 2002. Applicant was married from May 1996 to August \n2002. That marriage ended by divorce. Applicant and his ex-wife had twin sons \nduring their marriage, age 14. GE 1, Tr. 85-86. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his security clearance application, four credit reports, and \nan interview conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. GE 1 \u2013 6. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 10 separate line items, which included two \njudgments, one state tax lien, five collection accounts, one past due child support \naccount, and one charged off account for a total of $13,204. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.j. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stem from a costly divorce in 2002, \nuncovered medical expenses in 2004/2005, and unemployment/underemployment \nin 2006. He incurred significant medical bills in 2004/2005. His employer did not \nprovide him with health care insurance and he was unable to pay his medical bills \n\n \n3\non his limited salary working in security-related positions. Already financially \nstrained following his divorce, he fell behind on his other bills to include child \nsupport. GE 6, Tr. 16, 75. He has sought informal financial counseling through an \nattorney-friend. Tr. 83-84. \n \nTo address financial considerations concerns raised, Applicant has paid off \nfive collection accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. through 1.h.), has contacted three creditors \nand set up payment plans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.i., and 1.j.), and made a good-faith \neffort to resolve two judgment debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c.). Also, he submitted \ndocumentation that he has made payments on to these two creditors. Tr. 17-68, \nAE A \u2013 I.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is $1,504 judgment. Applicant has determined this debt has \nbeen sold/transferred to a new company. As soon as Applicant determines who \nthe new company is and has contact information, he will make payment \narrangements. SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a $1,320 state tax lien from a state Applicant lived in \nwhile he was stationed in the Army; however, he was never a legal resident in that \nstate. Applicant has contacted a state tax official and is trying to resolve this lien. \nResponse to SOR, Tr. 17-19, 29-35, 83, AE A. I did not detect any recalcitrance \non the part of Applicant in resolving these two debts or any other debts. \n \nApplicant estimates he has a net remainder of \u201c$200 to $300\u201d after paying \nhis monthly bills. Tr. 88. To minimize his costs, Applicant lives with a friend rent-\nfree and does not own an automobile. Rather, he takes public transportation to \nwork. His brother loans him his automobile without charge as needed. Two of his \nthree daily meals are provided by his employer. GE 6. \n \nApplicant provided three employer-related reference letters from his Project \nSecurity Officer, his former Site Manager, and a Vice President of a former \nemployer. These individuals were uniform in their praise of Applicant and \ndescribed him as \u201csecond to none,\u201d possessing \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201ctrustworthiness,\u201d \n\u201cconducts himself on the job in a highly professional manner,\u201d and \u201ctreat[s] clients \nwith the utmost respect and honestly.\u201d All three individuals recommended \nApplicant for a security clearance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \n\n \n4\n                                                          \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as \nto obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern \nis that an Applicant\u2019s \n \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n5\n \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stem from a costly divorce, uncovered \nmedical bills, and unemployment. He has struggled to remain financially afloat; \nhowever, given the unplanned costly life events he has experienced, it has not \nbeen easy. To minimize his expenses, he found a friend he could live with rent-\nfree, takes two of his three employer-provided meals at work, and does not own \nan automobile. For transportation, he uses public transportation and when \nneeded/necessary, he borrows his brother\u2019s automobile. Recognizing he was in \nover his head, he sought informal financial counseling from an attorney-friend. \nAfter he pays all his monthly bills, he has a net remainder of $200 to $300. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial picture has taken a sharp turnaround since he incurred \nthe debts identified in the SOR. His cost saving efforts and steady employment \nhave provided him with the necessary respite needed to place him on the road to \nfinancial recovery. He now has the tools to achieve financial stability. \n \n \nHis work-related reference letters are noteworthy. It is clear Applicant\u2019s \nemployers view him as a conscientious, trusted and valued employee. He also \nmakes a concerted effort to provide for his twin sons and remain involved in their \nupbringing. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt \nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n\n \n6\n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be \nexplained by subject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \nlisted supra, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable or partially \napplicable: \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case.

On January 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 30, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nFebruary 25, 2008. The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on \nFebruary 27, 2008. The case was transferred to me on March 13, 2008. On March 14, \n2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 3, 2008. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - \n2, which were admitted without objection. The Government requested that \nMay 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadministrative notice be taken of one document with 11 attachments. The document \nwas marked as Administrative Notice Document 1 (Admin Not 1) without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted six exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A \u2013 F without objection. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on April 11, 2008.  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic. The United States has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since April 7, 1980. The U.S. Department of State has set forth \nconcerns of the United States with Iran\u2019s policies as: (1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (2) Iran\u2019s support for and involvement \nin international terrorism; (3) Iran\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East \npeace process; and (4) Iran\u2019s dismal human rights record. (Admin Not 1, Doc 1 at 9) \nThe United States has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. (Admin Not 1, \nDoc 6 at 2.)  The government of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses against the Iranian people \ninclude summary executions, lack of fair public trials, disappearances, torture, arbitrary \narrest and detention, political prisoners and detainees, severe restrictions on freedom of \nreligion, discrimination against women, and severe restrictions on civil liberties including \nspeech, press, assembly, association, movement and privacy. (Admin Not 1, Doc 5 at 1; \nDoc 4 at 8.)  \n \n The U.S. State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens and U.S.\u2013Iranian \ndual citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Some elements of the \nIranian regime remain hostile to the U.S. and U.S. citizens. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens \nmay be subject to harassment or arrest while residing in Iran. (Admin Not 1, Doc 3.) \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, and the children of such persons, are considered \nsolely Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Under Iranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, \nunless the Iranian government has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian \ncitizenship. In the past, U.S.\u2013Iranian dual nationals have been denied permission to \nenter/depart Iran using their U.S. passport; they even had their U.S. passports \nconfiscated upon arrival or departure. (Admin Not 1, Doc 2 at 1.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated January 30, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations with noted objections.  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old senior security consultant employed with a Department \nof Defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since January 2005. \nShe has a Master\u2019s Degree in information technology. She is single. This is her first time \napplying for a security clearance. (Tr at 4-5, 42; Gov 1.)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States. Her father, a citizen of Iran, and a \nmember of the Iranian military attended military training for several years at a U.S. base. \nAfter he completed training, the family moved back to Iran. Applicant spent her \nformative years in Iran. She was educated in Iran. In 1999, she received her \nundergraduate degree from an Iranian university. Applicant always wanted to move to \nthe U.S. She decided to leave Iran after graduating.  She traveled to Germany in 1999. \nBased on the advice received from the Swiss Embassy, she traveled to Germany on her \nIranian passport. She received her U.S. passport and social security card from the U.S. \nEmbassy in Germany.  She stayed in Germany for a few months visiting with her sister \nand two of her aunts, all of whom reside in Germany. She also visited an aunt who \nresides in the United Kingdom. (Tr at 14-16.)  \n \nIn December 2000, Applicant moved to the U.S.  She found a job two weeks after \narriving in the United States. She worked full-time and went to graduate school on a \npart-time basis. She purchased a condominium in 2001. She received her Master\u2019s \nDegree in December 2004. (Tr at 59-60; Gov 1; AE E.)  \n \nAs a U.S. citizen, Applicant sponsored her parents and sister to come to the U.S.  \nHer parents moved to the U.S. in 2001. They reside with Applicant when they are in the \nU.S. Her mother is a U.S. permanent resident. Her father became a U.S. citizen in \nMarch 2007. (Tr at 61-63.) Her father retired from Iranian military in 1993 at the rank of \nGeneral.  He currently works for a car dealership in the U.S. Her mother is a retired high \nschool psychology teacher. (Tr at 55-58, 62; Gov 2, question 4.)  Her sister is an Iranian \ncitizen who currently works and resides in Germany. She is applying for German \ncitizenship. (Tr at 78; Gov 2, questions 10, 31.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandparents are citizens of and reside in Iran. She talks to her \ngrandparents about once a month. (Tr at 21; Answer to SOR; Gov 2, question 10.) She  \ntraveled to Iran in 2003, 2004, and 2006 to visit her grandparents. Her visits lasted \napproximately 10 days. Her mother is currently residing in Iran. She lives part of the \nyear in the U.S. and the other part of the year in Iran. She travels to Iran in order to care \nfor her parents (Applicant\u2019s grandparents.) who are elderly and have health issues. \nWhen her mother is living in Iran, Applicant talks to her once a week. Applicant\u2019s father \noccasionally travels to Iran as well. (Tr at 20, 64; Gov 2, questions 10, 31.) \n \nApplicant has two maternal uncles who live in Iran. One uncle is an accountant. \nOne uncle is retired. He is a permanent resident of the U.S. and lives part of the year in \nIran and part of the year in the U.S. She has two paternal uncles who live in Iran. One is \nvery old. Applicant thinks that he is an artist. The other uncle is a civil engineer. He is \napplying for Canadian citizenship and will be moving to Canada soon. (Tr at 65-71; Gov \n2, question 10.) Her contact with her uncles is limited. She talks with them about once \nor twice a year. She visited with them when she traveled to Iran to visit her \ngrandparents. She has a maternal aunt and a paternal aunt who live in Germany and a \nmaternal aunt who lives in the United Kingdom. (Tr at 68-70, 73; Gov 2 at 10.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has an Iranian passport which was issued on June 28, 1997. The \npassport expired on June 28, 2002. Applicant renewed the passport on December 8, \n2003, and it expired on June 28, 2007. (Gov 2, copy Iranian passport.) Applicant used \nher Iranian passport when she visited her grandparents in Iran in 2003, 2004 and 2006.  \nShe used her Iranian passport based on the advice of the U.S. State Department for \nsafety reasons.  (Tr at 60; Gov 2, questions 1-5; Admin Not I, attachments 2, 3.) In the \nfuture, she would like to be able to visit her grandparents in the event of an emergency \nor to attend their funerals. (Tr at 20.)  \n \nApplicant gave her expired Iranian passport to her Facility Security Officer (FSO). \nHer passport was placed in her personnel security file. She was advised by the FSO \nthat if she requested her passport back, it would be reported to the federal government.   \nThe FSO states that the company supports Applicant in her request for a security \nclearance. (Tr at 35-36; AE F.)  Applicant testified that it is likely that she will have to \nrenew her Iranian passport in order to travel to Iran should something happen to her \ngrandparents. (Tr at 75-76.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s second level manager testified on her behalf. Applicant has worked \nfor him for two and half years. He interacts with her periodically, probably on a monthly \nbasis. On past special projects, he worked with her on a daily basis.  He states that \nApplicant is a top performer within the organization. She is being groomed for more \nresponsible positions within the organization. She receives the highest level of \nperformance rating within her peer group. She was promoted last year and will be up for \npromotion this year.  (Tr at 40-45; AE D.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker, who also is a reservist, testified on her behalf. He has \nworked with her on a daily basis for the past two years. He describes her work \nperformance as excellent.  He holds a high opinion of her trustworthiness. (Tr at 47-50.) \nApplicant has received numerous favorable comments about her work performance \nfrom customers, co-workers and superiors. (AE A \u2013 C.) \n  \nApplicant will not share confidential information. She does not agree with the \npolicies of the Iranian government. She owns a condominium in the U.S. and all of her \nassets are here in the U.S.  While growing up in Iran, she always wanted to live in the \nU.S.  She is glad she finally got the opportunity to be here.  She would not be where she \nis today without the freedom that U.S. gave her to use.  She is a loyal U.S. citizen. (Tr at \n27-28.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several Foreign Preference Disqualifying Conditions (FP DC) \nthat could raise security concerns. The following apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n FP DC \u00b610(a) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through foreign citizenship of a family member. This \nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport);   \n \nFP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by \nan American citizen.) \n \nApplicant was born in the U.S., of Iranian parents. Her family moved back to Iran \nwhen she was a very young child.  Having grown up in Iran, it is apparent that Applicant \nexercised dual citizenship. After moving to the U.S., she exercised dual citizenship by \napplying for an extension of her Iranian passport in 2003 and using her Iranian passport \nto travel to and from Iran. It is noted that Applicant traveled with the Iranian passport for \nsafety reasons and based on the advice of the U.S. State Department.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Preference.  Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP \nMC) \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) applies. Applicant\u2019s passport expired on June 28, \n2007. She surrendered her expired passport to her FSO, the cognizant security \nauthority. While Applicant may intend to renew her Iranian passport in the future should \nan emergency happen related to her grandparents, at present, she does not possess a \nvalid Iranian passport.   \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference security concerns. Guideline C is \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \n\n \n7 \n \n \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); and FI DC \u00b6 7(b) \n(connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by \nproviding that information) applies as a result of Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of \nand reside in Iran.  There is a security risk because Applicant\u2019s maternal grandparents \nand mother currently reside in Iran.  Applicant\u2019s mother is currently living in Iran taking \ncare of Applicant\u2019s grandparents. It is clear that Applicant is close to her mother. Her \nmother lives with Applicant when she resides in the U.S. Applicant talks to her mother \nonce a week when she is living in Iran. She calls her maternal grandparents once a \nmonth. She visited them in March 2006, December 2004, and August 2003. She intends \nto travel to Iran in the future should an emergency arise involving one of her \ngrandparents. She intends to travel to Iran to attend their funerals.  \n \nApplicant also has four uncles who are citizens of and reside in Iran. Although \nshe only speaks with them once or twice a year, they raise a security concern based on \nApplicant\u2019s family contacts. Her father occasionally travels to Iran as well. Applicant\u2019s \nforeign relatives create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is a possibility that Iranian agents may exploit the opportunity to obtain \nintelligence, classified, or economic information about the U.S. A potential conflict is \ncreated between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology \nand her desire to help her family members, in particular, her mother and grandparents.  \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) & 7(d) (sharing living quarter \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s parents. Her parents live with Applicant when they are in the U.S.  \nHer mother is a permanent U.S. resident but resides a large part of the year in Iran.  Her \nfather is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran. Although he retired from the Iranian military \nin 1993, his status as a general officer has the potential to create a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. Several Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) have the potential to apply. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFIMC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.) does not apply. Family contacts and ties with persons in a \nforeign country are not automatically disqualifying but require the applicant to present \nevidence in mitigation and extenuation that he or she qualifies for a security clearance. \nIran\u2019s hostile relationship with the United States and the country\u2019s poor human rights \nrecord place \u201ca heavy burden of persuasion on applicant to show his or her family \nmembers do not pose a security risk.\u201d (See, ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 3 (App.Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006.) Applicant has not met that burden. She has close ties to her \ngrandparents. She acknowledges that she will likely renew her Iranian passport should \nanything happen to  them.  Her mother is currently in Iran taking care of Applicant\u2019s \ngrandparents. Although her father is a U.S. citizen, he is a retired general officer of the \nIranian military. While he has been retired since 1993, his status has the potential to \nraise the level of scrutiny by the Iranian government. Applicant\u2019s family ties in Iran are \nsignificant enough to raise foreign influence concerns. The risk is heightened due to the \nnature of the Iranian government.      \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) does not apply.  While Applicant may not have a sense of loyalty or \nobligation to the Iranian government, she does have a sense of obligation to her family \nmembers who reside in Iran that cannot be described as minimal. She contacts her \ngrandparents once a month. She contacts her mother once a week during the time she \nlives in Iran. Her mother lives with Applicant when she lives in the U.S. While Applicant \nhas less contact with her uncles who live and reside in Iran, she did visit with them \nwhen she traveled to Iran to visit her grandparents and speaks with them once or twice \na year, usually during the holidays. While Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1999, her \nsignificant ties to relatives living in Iran raise questions as to whether she can resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s relationship with her mother and  \ngrandparents cannot be considered casual and infrequent.  Although she has limited \ncontact with her uncles, speaking to them only once or twice a year, her contact with her \nuncles cannot be described as casual or infrequent.   \n \nApplicant has not met her burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nForeign Influence.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is highly thought of by her \nsuperiors and co-workers. She is considered a top performer by her company and is \nbeing groomed for advancement. There is no doubt that Applicant has a successful \ncareer ahead of her. However, Applicant\u2019s outstanding work performance does not \nreduce the very significant security threat raised by Applicant\u2019s family members in Iran. \nThe government need not prove an applicant is a bad person before it can deny or \nrevoke access to classified information. Even good people can pose a security risk \nbecause of facts and circumstances not under their control. An applicant with good \ncharacter and personal integrity can pose a security risk because the applicant has \nclose relatives in a country that is hostile to the U.S. (ISCR No. 01-26893, at 9-10 (App. \nBd. Oct. 16, 2002.)  \n \nGuideline B is a security concern that can affect Applicants through no fault of \ntheir own. In fact, under Guideline B, an Applicant\u2019s familial obligations, which are highly \nregarded in other situations, raise security concerns when family members reside in \nanother country. The current nature of the Iranian government and the hostile \nrelationship between Iran and the U.S. make it a substantial burden to mitigate the \nconcerns raised under foreign influence.  Applicant\u2019s favorable work performance and \ncontacts within the U.S. do not outweigh the concerns raised by having relatives who \nare citizens of and reside in Iran. Foreign Influence security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of August 27, 2007, Applicant owed delinquent debts totaling $21,350 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.l) that had been charged off and/or placed for collection. Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 25, 2006, security clearance application (SF 86) by denying that he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts within the seven years preceding his clearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.a) or that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.b). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts but indicated he was paying on those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.j, and would look into the $874 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l as he had medical insurance. As for the Guideline E allegations, Applicant averred he was unaware of his indebtedness, which was taken as a denial of any intentional falsification. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 57-year-old senior designer who seeks to retain his secret-level security clearance (Tr. 54). He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from December 1973 to October 1976, in his state\u2019s National Guard from January 1985 to July 1986, and in the U.S. Army Ready Reserve from July 1986 to October 1988.

On October 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nand Guideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 30, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 19, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 30,\n2007. On December 6, 2007, I received the case assignment and scheduled a hearing\nfor January 22, 2008.\nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing on January 22, 2008, as scheduled. Before the\nintroduction of any evidence, the Government withdrew SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.m\n(duplicate listing of \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.b, respectively). Four Government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and\nfour Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were received into evidence without objection and\nApplicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on\nJanuary 31, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s request, the record was held open until January 29,\n2007, for him to submit documents of his enrollment in a debt repayment program. On\nJanuary 28, 2008, Applicant forwarded documentation of a debt repayment plan that\nwas admitted as Exhibit E without any objections.\nOn February 3, 2008, Applicant submitted a bank draft authorization form related\nto the debt management plan. The Government did not object to its inclusion despite\nthe late submission. The document and Applicant\u2019s forwarding correspondence were\nadmitted as Exhibit F. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of August 27,\n2007, Applicant owed delinquent debts totaling $21,350 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.l)\nthat had been charged off and/or placed for collection. Under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 25, 2006,\nsecurity clearance application (SF 86) by denying that he had been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts within the seven years preceding his clearance application\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) or that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts but indicated he was paying on\nthose in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.j, and would look into the $874 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l as\nhe had medical insurance. As for the Guideline E allegations, Applicant averred he was\nunaware of his indebtedness, which was taken as a denial of any intentional\nfalsification. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior designer who seeks to retain his secret-level\nsecurity clearance (Tr. 54). He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from\nDecember 1973 to October 1976, in his state\u2019s National Guard from January 1985 to\nJuly 1986, and in the U.S. Army Ready Reserve from July 1986 to October 1988. He\nwas honorably discharged from these enlistments (Ex. 1, Tr. 52-53).\nThe father of two grown sons from his first marriage, Applicant married his\ncurrent spouse in December 1978. They have three adult children of their own, two\ndaughters born in September 1978 and December 1979, and a son born in August\n1983.  As of January 2008, their youngest son was living at home during the week and\nhe was not contributing to the household (Ex. 1, Tr. 53, 97-98). \nIn June 1980, Applicant started working for a defense contractor at a different\nfacility than where he is currently employed. He was granted a secret-level security\n\n3\nclearance for his duties in about August 1990. In August 1994, he transferred to his\npresent location to avoid a layoff. He started there as a draftsman and moved up to\nsenior designer (Tr. 36). His clearance was renewed in March 1995 and in August 1998\n(Ex. 1).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse handled the family\u2019s finances with little input from him (Tr.\n37). In 2001, Applicant\u2019s accounts began to fall delinquent. A joint charge account\nopened with a retailer became $548 past due in February 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In about\nJune 2001, a $3,493 credit card balance was charged off after no activity since\nNovember 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In October 2001, an individual revolving charge account\nwas charged off in the amount of $925 and transferred (SOR \u00b6 1.h). A $2,018\ndelinquent credit balance was placed for collection after no activity since February 2001\n(SOR \u00b6 1.j). Another credit card balance of $927 was placed for collection by a bank in\nSeptember 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A $5,956 debt balance in collection for nonpayment since\nNovember 2000 rose to $7,510 as of November 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). A $268 charge off\nbalance was placed for collection for failure to pay since February 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.k).\nSee Ex. 2, Ex. 4.\nIn February 2002, Applicant was injured at home. During the 13 weeks he was\nout of work, Applicant received disability insurance payments that covered his wages for\na 40-hour-work week but not overtime (Tr. 41-42, 47, 55-56). In February 2002, a\njudgment was awarded a medical provider against Applicant in the amount of $581.\nApplicant satisfied the judgment in March 2002. After an automobile accident, Applicant\ndisputed the debt remaining on his loan, but he eventually satisfied a judgment balance\nof $2,175 awarded the creditor in November 2002 (Ex. 4, Tr. 72-74). \nIn May 2002, Applicant paid at least $7,500 toward the $15,000 cost of his\ndaughter\u2019s wedding. He is not sure how he paid for his share (Tr. 57). In December\n2002, a medical provider placed a $615 delinquent balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.l).\nApplicant had therapy on the leg he injured in February 2002 and this cost was not\ncovered by insurance. Applicant received collection notices in the mail but assumed\nsince he had insurance that it was due to a problem with the account number. Applicant\ndid not followup to ensure that the matter was resolved (Ex. 4, Tr. 71-72).\nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law came to live with them. Applicant\u2019s spouse,\nwho had been employed full-time as a bank teller, stopped working but for a seasonal\nposition with a tax preparation firm each Spring (Tr. 49-50). She lost some income that\nfirst tax season as she fell ill with pneumonia and had to be hospitalized in intensive\ncare for five days, but her medical costs were largely covered by insurance (Tr. 58).\nWhile vacationing for their 25  wedding anniversary, Applicant and his spouse\nth\nwere talked into buying a timeshare in October 2003. They fell behind in the payments\n\nThe debt balance as of August 2007 was $7,588 (Ex. 3). The account was placed for collection when it was\n1\npast due in the amount of $3,205 (Ex. 4).\nApplicant provided no proof of payments on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, or 1.j. The credit reports (Ex. 2, Ex. 3) reflect no\n2\nprogress on those debts. Applicant is seeking to have the full $7,510 balance of \u00b6 1.f paid through the debt\nmanagement plan (Ex. E), which calls into question whether he made the $250 monthly payments claimed\nin May 2007. The debt in \u00b6 1.j is not included in the latest debt management plan, Applicant listed an updated\nbalance of $2,812 (Ex. A), which also calls into question whether any payments had been made. As for the\n4\non their loan, and it became past due in the amount of $3,205 (SOR \u00b6 1.c)  (Ex. 4, Tr.\n1\n62-66).\nIn March 2005, a wireless telephone provider placed a $175 balance for\ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant had opened a wireless phone account for his youngest\nson who did not pay the bill (Tr. 70). A telephone service provider placed a $101\nbalance for collection in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) (Ex. 4).\nAt his employer\u2019s request, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for\ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) on October 25, 2006. Applicant responded negatively\nto financial delinquency inquiries: 28a. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28b. \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d (Ex. 1).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 3, 2006, revealed several delinquent\nbalances: $543 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $1,300 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $7,588 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $3,493 (SOR\n\u00b61.d), $7,510 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), $101 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $175 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), $2,812 (SOR \u00b6 1.j),\n$268 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and $874 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). Another creditor had charged off a $925 debt\nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.h), but there was no indication it was being collected (Ex. 4).\nIn January 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis finances. He was shown his credit report at that time (Tr. 74, 94-95). \nIn June 2007, Applicant took out a $25,000 loan from his 401(k) account to\npurchase and refurbish a motor home that he has used twice for camping (Tr. 99-101).\nHe is repaying the loan at $44.97 per week (Ex. B). The motor home sits at a friend\u2019s\nhouse (Tr. 99).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on August 27, 2007, showed Applicant had opened\nnew credit card accounts in December 2006 and May 2007 with respective limits of\n$500 and $300. He owed balances of $440 and $194. His credit report also disclosed\noutstanding balances on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c (balance $7,588), 1.d, and 1.f\n($7,510) (Ex. 3).\nIn a September 2007 response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant indicated\nthat he had no knowledge of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l. He averred the\nwireless services debt in \u00b6 1.i was his son\u2019s and had been paid, and he was making\npayments of $50 monthly on the debt in \u00b6 1.j, and of $250 monthly on the debt in \u00b6 1.f.2\n\nwireless phone debt on an account Applicant opened for his youngest son, he was asked whether his son had\ndone anything to clear up the debt. Applicant responded, \u201cApparently not. I\u2019m going to be stuck with it.\u201d Tr.\n70).\n5\nApplicant attributed his debts to him being out of work for 13 weeks in 2002, to the\nexpense of his daughter\u2019s wedding in May 2002, and to his spouse\u2019s on and off\nemployment in the past five years. Applicant provided a personal financial statement\nreflecting a monthly net remainder of $55 after payment of expenses and $130 on credit\ncards. As for his failure to disclose his debts on his clearance application, Applicant\nstated:\nI am sorry that I misunderstood the question. I thought I was only filling out\nthe questionnaire as to any updates or routine maintenance of my\nclearance. I did not believe that my financial status had any bearing on my\nsecurity clearance. I felt I was not applying for a loan. I have worked here\nfor over 27 years and am a veteran of our armed services.\nEx. 2.\nAfter he received the SOR, Applicant contacted a debt management firm for\nassistance in dealing with his debt. His spouse refused to become involved (\u201cI got a\nhold of them without my wife. She\u2019s refused to get involved with any of this.\u201d Tr. 38). On\nNovember 8, 2007, the debt management firm proposed to address $15,625 in debt\n(including old balances of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, 1.l) on payments from Applicant\nof $534 monthly from November 20, 2007 (Ex. D). \nOn November 27, 2007, Applicant attempted to resolve his debt by applying for\na hardship withdrawal of $36,000 from his 401(k), claiming that his debt was from\nunreimbursed medical expenses, and from attorney fees or court-related judgments. His\napplication was denied. As of January 17, 2008, Applicant had $53,752.80 available for\na hardship withdrawal if he could establish his eligibility (Ex. C, Tr. 38-39).\nOver the December 2007/January 2008 time frame, Applicant contacted his\ncreditors and obtained updated balance information ($597.44 on \u00b6 1.a, $1,422 on \u00b6 1.b,\n$7,588 on \u00b6 1.c, $3,493.34 on \u00b6 1.d, $7,510 on \u00b6 1.f, $110 on \u00b6 1.g, $925 on \u00b6 1.h,\n$2,812 on \u00b6 1.j, $268 on \u00b6 1.k, and $874 on \u00b6 1.l) (Ex. A, Tr. 39-42). On January 23,\n2008, the debt management firm proposed to resolve $13,896.78 of Applicant\u2019s debt\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.l) by January 2011 in return for $498 the first month\nand $449 monthly thereafter. Applicant and his spouse signed the agreement on\nJanuary 28, 2008 (Ex. E). Applicant arranged for automatic withdrawal from his and his\nspouse\u2019s joint checking account in the amount of $449 per month starting February 20,\n2008 (Ex. F).\nApplicant had taken no steps toward resolving the delinquent debt for the\ntimeshare as of January 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The creditor offered to settle the debt for\n$2,000. He told the creditor he would pay it if allowed to take a hardship withdrawal from\n\n6\nhis 401(k). As of January 2008, the lender was holding off on foreclosure action pending\ninformation from Applicant due the date of his hearing (\u201cI was supposed to call them\ntoday, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be happening.\u201d Tr. 66-67). He had not\nconsidered stopping his contributions to his 401(k) to obtain the funds to resolve his\ndebts (Tr. 87-88).\n \nApplicant earned about $71,000 at his defense contractor job in 2006. Due to\nless overtime, he earned about $10,000 less in 2007 (Tr. 47-48). As of January 12,\n2008, Applicant\u2019s hourly wage was $28.05 (Ex. B). His spouse was still handling the\nfamily\u2019s finances (Tr.  48). He estimated they have about $255 available each month in\ndiscretionary funds (Tr. 86). As of January 2008, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was giving\nApplicant about $600 per month, which is sufficient to cover the expense of caring for\nher (Tr. 97). Applicant\u2019s spouse drives a 2007 model year convertible that costs them\n$160 per week. They took out a joint five-year automobile loan in September 2007 (Tr.\n88, 96).\n At his hearing, Applicant testified on direct examination that he understood he\nmade \u201ca grave mistake\u201d by not reporting any debts on his security clearance application,\nbut he was not totally aware of his indebtedness (Tr. 37). When asked to explain on\ncross-examination why he responded \u201cNo\u201d to the debt inquiries if he knew he had some\nindebtedness, Applicant responded:\nTo be honest with you, I kind of struggled through those questions.\nBasically, that was embarrassment, and I did not\u2013at the time, I did not\u2013I\ndidn\u2019t think they were going to run a credit report, to be honest with you. I\nthought it was just updating everything, you know, did we still live at the\nsame address and so on and so forth.\nApplicant thereafter admitted that he knew his answers to questions 28a. and 28b. were\nfalse, and he expressed regret for lying about his financial situation (Tr. 90-91).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n7\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n8\nApplicant and his spouse did not spend wisely and incurred obligations beyond\nwhat they could reasonably afford on their incomes. Beginning in 2001, creditors began\ncharging off and/or referring delinquent balances for collection. While a couple of debts\nthat went to court judgment were eventually satisfied, about $16,000 in delinquent debt\nwas still outstanding when he and his spouse purchased a timeshare in October 2003.\nThey fell behind some $3,205 in that loan as well. With more than $24,000 in delinquent\ndebt to be repaid, Applicant borrowed $25,000 from his 401(k) to buy and refurbish a\nmotor home in June 2007 that sits in his friend\u2019s yard. Security significant concerns are\nraised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)), by \u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of\nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt\u201d (AG \u00b6\n19(b)), by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)), and by\n\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(e)).\nWhen he answered interrogatories in September 2007, Applicant attributed his\nindebtedness to him being out of work following an accident in 2002, to the expense of\nhis daughter\u2019s wedding in 2002, and to his spouse\u2019s seasonal employment since 2003.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), such circumstances are potentially mitigating of financial\nconsiderations concerns (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). However, Applicant has not shown that\nhis financial problems were due primarily to the lack of sustainable income, or to\nmedical expenses. Although he lost the opportunity for overtime earnings during the 13\nweeks of recuperation, his salary was covered by disability insurance. The loss of\nspousal income has been compensated for in part by his mother-in-law contributing\n$600 monthly to the household. Medical costs were largely covered by health\ninsurance. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate the judgment concerns raised by several years\nof disregard for his financial obligations.\nApplicant\u2019s claimed ignorance of his debt (\u201cI was unaware how bad everything\nwas, seriously. I\u2019m not lying to you. I was totally unaware.\u201d Tr. 82) is not supported by\nthe evidence. Even though his spouse handled the family\u2019s finances, he knew of\ncollection notices from at least one creditor pursuing the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l and\nhe did not follow up (Tr. 71-72). He knew he had financial problems when he filled out\nhis SF 86 in October 2006 (Tr. 90), and was shown his credit report in January 2007\n(Tr. 95). He placed his immediate desires ahead of his obligation to his creditors and his\nfuture financial security by borrowing against his retirement to purchase a recreational\nvehicle in June 2007. While he receives some credit for repaying that loan, the decision\nto purchase the motor home is difficult to justify given his more than $26,000 in\noutstanding delinquent debt.\nAfter the SOR was issued, Applicant attempted without success to obtain a\nhardship withdrawal from his 401(k) in November 2007. He contacted a debt\nmanagement firm and took the initial step of obtaining updated debt balance information\nfrom his creditors. These efforts to resolve his delinquencies implicate AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe\n\n9\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d). Yet, even if his claims of satisfaction of the $175 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and of\npayments on those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.j are accepted as accurate, he has not\ndone enough to persuade me that the financial issues are likely to be resolved in the\nforeseeable future. As of his hearing on January 22, 2008, he had not signed off on a\nproposed plan to repay $15,625 of his debt through monthly repayments of $534. After\nhis hearing, he presented a new debt management plan under which he and his spouse\nagree to pay $449 monthly to resolve debts totaling $13,896.78 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d,\n1.f, and 1.l). However, with about $255 in discretionary funds available per month,\nApplicant has not shown that he can afford those payments. He testified that his spouse\nis seeking employment, but admitted she has not had any success (Tr. 86). Given\nApplicant\u2019s credit history and lack of present means to make those $449 payments, it is\npremature to conclude that his financial problems are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthere\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) does not\napply. Moreover, concerns persist that Applicant will continue to engage in discretionary\npurchases that may stress his financial situation further. He took on the financial burden\nof a car loan that costs him about $640 monthly for five years without any significant\nthought:\nQ. And again, given your financial situation, did you discuss the possibility\nof buying a cheaper car, rather than a 2007 model?\nA. No. I see your point.\n(Tr. 88). He also continues to rationalize in his own mind the purchase of the motor\nhome (\u201cI know sometimes people do need some pleasure and enjoyment to get away\nfrom things, even if it\u2019s once a year.\u201d Tr. 112).\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs of October 2006 when Applicant applied for renewal of his secret-level\nclearance, he owed on several accounts that had been delinquent since 2003 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l). In March 2005, a wireless telephone provider\nplaced a $175 balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.i). A long distance services provider\nplaced a $101 balance for collection in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). All these debts should\nhave been reported in response to the financial delinquency inquiries pertinent to debts\n\n10\nover 180 days within the past seven years (section 28a) and to debts currently over 90\ndays delinquent (section 28b).  Applicant instead responded \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. \nUnder AG \u00b6 16(a) personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d Applicant doesn\u2019t contest that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the debt inquiries.\nWhen he answered the SOR, he denied any intentional falsification, and claimed he\nwas unaware of his indebtedness. However, in response to DOHA interrogatories in\nSeptember 2007, Applicant stated in part:\nI am sorry that I misunderstood the question. I thought I was only filling out\nthe questionnaire as to any updates or routine maintenance of my\nclearance. I did not believe that my financial status had any bearing on my\nsecurity clearance.\nEx. 2. If Applicant had no knowledge of his indebtedness, it stands to reason he would\nhave so indicated when he was first confronted. Instead, he attempted to justify his false\nresponses by claiming that he failed to understand that his financial situation had any\nbearing on his clearance. At his hearing, Applicant admitted that he had lied on his\nsecurity clearance application, although he again provided an excuse (\u201cI thought it was\njust updating everything, you know, did we still live at the same address and so on and\nso forth.\u201d Tr. 90). AG \u00b6 16(a) applies.\nConcerns as to whether Applicant understands his obligation of full candor\npreclude me from applying AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts\nto correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts\u201d). The details of his debts first surfaced in a credit report and were not volunteered\nup-front. As recently as November 2007, he continued to justify his negative responses\nto the debt inquiries on his SF 86:\nI admit that I did not answer Question 28A and 28B of [my SF 86]\ncorrectly. I did not fully understand the extent of the investigation that\nwould be taking place. If I could turn the clock back I would mark yes, but I\nstill could not list my debts at that time because I did not know the full\nextent of my financial condition. I was fully unaware of all the collections\netc. I do not see all of the bills that come in.\nSee Answer. His belated expression of regret is noted in his favor, but it is not enough\nto overcome the personal conduct concerns. None of the mitigating conditions apply.\n\n11\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long tenure with the\ndefense contractor, but he has not exhibited good judgment in handling his personal\nfinancial matters. He placed his personal interest ahead of his obligation to his creditors.\nMoreover, as a longtime holder of a security clearance, Applicant knew or should have\nknown of the importance of being completely candid with the Government. Whether\nfrom embarrassment or more likely fear that disclosure of his debts could negatively\naffect his clearance and perhaps his continued employment, Applicant put self-interest\nahead of his fiduciary obligation to the Government. Efforts at reform are too recent and\nincomplete to overcome the considerable concerns about his judgment and reliability.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nWithdrawn\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 17, 2012, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) setting forth security concerns under Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).1 In his notarized Answer of \nSeptember 8, 2012, Applicant denied the allegations. He also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \n \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November 19, 2012, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on December 11, 2012. Department Counsel offered six exhibits, \nwhich I admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and \noffered the testimony of one additional witness. He also submitted 11 exhibits, which I \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended.

On January 15, 2013, I received Applicant's brief (HE II), with \nthree additional exhibits attached. Department Counsel raised no objection. I admitted \nthem as AE L through N.2 Department Counsel submitted a brief dated January 31, \n2013. (HE III) The record closed on February 4, 2013. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter reviewing the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 66 years old and single. He married in 1967, divorced in 1984, and \nhas three adult children. Applicant and his family are native-born U.S. citizens. He \ncompleted a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1969 and a doctorate in computer science in 1987. \nBetween 1969 and 1987, he held a secret security clearance while employed as a DoD \ncontractor.

In about 1998, he started working on defense contracts \ninvolving military health care management.

She respects his professional opinions and considers him an \nimportant member of her team. (GE 1; AE G, H, I, K; Tr. 31-44, 142-143) \n \nIn about 1999, Applicant met Dr. A., a Chinese citizen. A few months after they \nmet, they became roommates and sexual partners. On his January 2006 security \nclearance application, Applicant listed his own street address, apartment number, and \ncity for Dr. A. He testified that providing the same address as his own indicated Dr. A. \n                                                 \n2 AE L through N are cited in Applicant's brief (HE II) as Attachment A through C, respectively.  \n\n \n \n3\nwas his roommate. However, he listed a different state for Dr. A.\u2019s address. He testified \nthat he mistakenly listed the incorrect state. He also testified he \u201cfelt an obligation to \nindicate that I did live with him so that there would be no doubt.\u201d During his May 2007 \nsecurity interview, Applicant stated that Dr. A. resided with him. (GE 1, 2, 4, 6; AE K; Tr. \n69-77) \n \nUnder Section 14/15 of the security clearance application, \u201cYour Relatives and \nAssociates,\u201d the choices include \u201cGuardian,\u201d \u201cAssociate\u201d and \u201cAdult Currently Living \nWith You.\u201d Applicant did not list Dr. A. as an \u201cAdult Currently Living With You.\u201d He \nbelieved that because neither \u201croommate\u201d nor \u201chousemate\u201d was among the options, the \nword \u201cassociate\u201d best described his relationship with Dr. A. The instructions for that \ncategory state, \u201cInclude only foreign national associates with whom you or your spouse \nare bound by affection, obligation, or close and continuing contact.\u201d He chose this \ndescription because he and Dr. A. had close and continuing contact, although Applicant \ndid not feel that they were \u201cbound by affection or obligation.\u201d He also stated on his \nsecurity clearance application that Dr. A. was a Chinese citizen, and that he, \u201chas been \na resident alien since 03/08/99 . . . I am his business partner in the [company name] \nlisted in foreign companies.\u201d (GE 1, 6; AE K; Tr. 69-77) \n \nApplicant did not describe Dr. A. in the 2006 security clearance application as a \ncohabitant. At the hearing, he said the word \u201ccohabitant\u201d was not accurate, because \nthey were not in a spouse-like relationship. In his October 2007 response to DOHA \nforeign influence interrogatories, Applicant described Dr. A. as a \u201ccohabitant, business \nassociate.\u201d However, in his 2008 interview,3 he stated that when he used the word \n\u201ccohabitant\u201d in 2007, he \u201cmisspoke, and didn\u2019t mean we were life partners or in a \nspouse-like relationship. We were just housemates/roommates then, and we are just \nhousemates/roommates now.\u201d Later in that interview, Applicant clarified this statement \nby stating that he and Dr. A. had a sexual relationship which started in 1999 and ended \nin 2006. He added that he could not be blackmailed based on this relationship. Dr. A. \nbecame a U.S. citizen in September 2008.4 They remain roommates, and Applicant \ndescribed their current relationship as \u201cbest of friends.\u201d Applicant pays for the household \nexpenses, and Dr. A. takes care of household duties. (GE 1, 2, 4, 6; AE K; Tr. 69-77, \n91) \n \nDr. A., 57 years old, was an orthopedic surgeon in china before immigrating to \nthe United States. In 1986, he came to the United States to pursue a graduate degree in \n                                                 \n3 Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in May 2007. In \nMay 2012, Applicant reviewed the summary of the interview, made minor changes, and adopted the \nreviewed version as accurate (GE 4) He completed DOHA Foreign Influence Interrogatories in October \n2007. (GE 6) In November 2008, Applicant was also interviewed by an OPM agent over a two-day \nperiod. He reviewed the resulting affidavit, made minor changes, and signed a statement that it was true \nto the best of his knowledge and belief. (GE 2) \n \n4 China does not recognize dual citizenship.

After the \n1989 protests in Tiananmen Square in China, Dr. A. agreed to testify before the U.S. \nCongress about conditions in China. Several years later, in 1999, Dr. A. met Applicant. \nIn 2000, when Dr. A. worked at a university hospital, his employer was hosting a \nconference in China, and asked Dr. A. to accompany the participants. Dr. A. feared he \nmight be on a \u201cwatch list,\u201d and be arrested if he returned to China because of his \nCongressional testimony. Therefore, he asked Applicant to join him on the trip. \nApplicant testified, \u201cHe had a fear that he -- he did not want to return to China by \nhimself. He wanted to in essence have a witness.\u201d Dr. A. was not approached or \ndetained during the trip. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE K, M; Tr. 78-80, 150-153) \n \nFor about six months between 2002 and 2003, Dr. A. and Applicant worked on \nsetting up an exchange program through which American nursing students at a U.S. \nuniversity would receive college credits and experience by working as nurses in China. \nChinese hospitals would also benefit, because they had a severe shortage of nurses. \nDuring their 2002 trip to China, Applicant and Dr. A. visited a nursing school for three \ndays and gave a presentation to school officials about the project. They also presented \nit to a local medical school. Both schools were interested but expressed the need for \nfunding. Applicant and Dr. A. planned to submit a funding proposal to a U.S. federal \nagency. However, the war in Iraq prevented the agency from providing funds, and the \nproject ended. (GE 2, 6) \n \nWhen he was a teen, Dr. A. learned farming because his father, a university \nprofessor, was sent to a farm during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. On one of his trips \nto China in the early 2000s, Dr. A. learned that the Chinese government was offering \nland at a low price to those who would start businesses in an agricultural development \nzone. The Chinese government offered additional benefits if the Chinese business was \nstructured as a joint venture with a foreign company. The benefits included tax-free \noperation for several years, a company car at 40 percent off retail price, and free \nhousing. (GE 2; Tr. 81-83, 87, 101, 108, 135, 153-156) \n \nDr. A. decided to start a company focusing on herbs, fruits, and vegetables used \nin traditional Chinese medicine. Applicant described the business as a \u201cbio-technology \nmicro-propagation and agriculture company.\u201d Dr. A. and Applicant took several \ncompany-related trips to China. Dr. A. conducted business, and Applicant considered it \na vacation. They usually stayed two to three weeks. Dr. A.\u2019s Chinese company, MS,5 \nhad 40 acres of land, and five or six workers to grow the product. The local \ngovernment\u2019s agriculture department provided a three-story building, comparable to a \ntownhouse, for company use rent-free for several years. The Chinese employees of \nCompany MS lived there. Applicant and Dr. A. also stayed there on visits to China \nbetween January 2004 and June 2006. In 2004 or 2005, Applicant attended two or three \nmeetings with city officials when Dr. A. was establishing his farming business. Applicant \n                                                 \n5 Dr. A.\u2019s U.S. and Chinese corporations used slightly different names. The U.S. corporation will be \nreferred to in this decision as Corporation M, and the Chinese company as Company MS. (Tr. 115) \n \n\n \n \n5\nwas not involved in the discussions because they were conducted in Chinese. In 2003 \nor 2004, Applicant also accompanied Dr. A. to a three-day business fair in China for \nnew companies. Applicant did not interact with the local citizens or city officials who \nattended because of the language barrier. (GE 2; AE M; Tr. 81-83, 87, 101, 108, 135, \n153-156)  \n \n \nDr. A. asked Applicant to set up a U.S. company to partner with his Chinese \ncompany so that he could obtain the joint-venture benefits offered by the Chinese \ngovernment.6 In January 2004, Applicant agreed to help Dr. A. In his 2008 interview, \nApplicant stated, \u201cIf my financial help provided some cost-cutting for his business in the \nPRC, then I was more than happy to assist.\u201d He prepared an application to incorporate \nCorporation M, a U.S. limited liability corporation, in his home state, using his and Dr. \nA.\u2019s address as the address of the corporation. Applicant, Dr. A., and four of Dr. A.\u2019s \nfriends comprised the board of directors. Applicant listed himself as the chief financial \nofficer (CFO). Along with Applicant and Dr. A., three or four of the directors were \nChinese citizens.7 Applicant testified they did not establish corporation rules, file \ndocuments, or pay required fees, because it was created solely to enable them to \nestablish Corporation M bank accounts. The state corporation commission terminated \nthe corporation on June 3, 2005, when it failed to pay the annual registration fee. \nApplicant noted in his 2008 affidavit that \u201cit would be fair to say\u201d that he had an informal \nrelationship with China based on his association with Dr. A. and Company MS. (GE 2, \n6; AE B, L, M; Tr. 83-84, 87, 100, 102-103, 108, 146-147) \n \nApplicant accompanied Dr. A. on six visits to China between November 2000 and \nJune 2006.8 He also took weekly Chinese language classes between 2004 and 2006 \nbecause of his frequent travel there related to the Chinese Company MS. He \ndiscontinued the classes in 2006, because Company MS went out of business, and \n\u201ctherefore, there wouldn\u2019t be any foreseeable trips to the PRC.\u201d Applicant visited the \nChinese embassy in the United States 12 times between 2000 and 2005 for travel \nvisas. In China, he sometimes stayed in hotels, and sometimes in the Company MS \ntownhouse. Applicant and Dr. A. also visited Russia for three weeks in December 2001. \nThey visited a medical school in one major Russian city and asked about its nursing \nprogram. They also spent three or four days visiting Dr. A.\u2019s nephew, at the medical \nschool he attends in another major Russian city. They spoke with \u201crandom students\u201d \nabout the nursing program there, talked with numerous professors about Russia\u2019s \n                                                 \n6 Applicant was not required to report foreign travel to his company, but informed his supervisors when \nhe planned to be outside of the United States. (GE 2) He informed his employer of his connection with \nthe Chinese Company MS. (GE 3) \n \n7 Applicant was uncertain if one of the directors, Dr. W., is currently a German citizen, or if he was a \nGerman citizen or a Chinese citizen when the company was incorporated. (Tr. 96) \n \n8 Applicant listed five visits to China between 2000 and 2006 in his January 2006 security clearance \napplication, four visits during his May 2007 security interview, and six visits in his October 2007 \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories.

On his \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant listed the purpose of his trips to China and \nRussia as \u201cpleasure.\u201d Dr. A. paid for Applicant's hotel, meals, and transportation on \nseveral of the trips to China, because Applicant paid for Dr. A.\u2019s expenses when they \nwere in the United States. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE K) \n \nDuring their trips to China in 2000, 2002, and 2006, Applicant and Dr. A. met with \nDr. A.\u2019s sisters and their families. One of Dr. A.\u2019s sisters, a Chinese citizen and resident, \nis a retired 57-year-old doctor. Her husband is a retired engineer, and their adult son is \nunemployed. Dr. A. last spoke to his sister about three years ago. They usually \nexchange Christmas emails, but did not do so in 2012. His other sister is a 65-year-old \ncitizen and resident of China. She is a retired high school teacher. Her husband is 65, \nretired, and has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dr. A. speaks with her monthly by telephone. \nTheir son is a medical doctor at a Chinese hospital. Dr. A. and his nephew speak by \ntelephone once per month, and exchange occasional emails. Dr. A. last visited his \nsisters in 2009. As of 2008, Applicant had no plans to visit China in the future, but stated \nhe would likely go if Dr. A. wished to go for a vacation. In 2013, Applicant and Dr. A. \nstated they have no plans to travel to China. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE K, L, M; Tr. 80, 92) \n \nOn his trips to China, Applicant met numerous farmers and peasants who were \nold friends of Dr. A. Applicant and Dr. A. also met with his former medical school \nclassmates. Applicant noted that some of them had become mid-level Chinese \ngovernment workers.9 The following friends, and one family member, became involved \nin the U.S. and Chinese companies.

Dr. A. believes he is a German citizen. Dr. A. was a \nmedical school classmate of Dr. W. and has known him since 1980. Dr. W. was on the \nboard of directors of Corporation M. He agreed to invest approximately $15,000 in Dr. \nA.\u2019s business. Applicant met Dr. W. once in about 2004 when they were visiting the \nCompany MS business quarters in China. Applicant and Dr. A. had dinner with Dr. W. \nand his mother. When Dr. A. was in the United States, he talked about monthly with Dr. \nW. by telephone. Until about 2009 or 2010, Applicant had brief contacts with Dr. W. if he \nanswered the phone when Dr. W. called Dr. A. at home. Dr. W. spoke little English. As \nof 2008, Applicant stated Dr. A. and Dr. W. were close friends and remained in touch. In \n2013, Dr. A. stated he has not seen Dr. W. since 2004 or 2005, talks to him by \ntelephone every few months, and exchanges emails every three months. Applicant did \nnot list Dr. W. on security documents or in his security interviews because he did not \nbelieve he had \u201cclose and continuing contact\u201d with Dr. W.

He replied that \nhis DoD employment involved professional\u2014but not personal\u2014contact with foreign citizens from \n\u201ccountries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan.\u201d (GE 3) \n\n \n \n7\ncompany. He was a member of the board of directors of the U.S. corporation. In his \n2008 interview, Applicant said he met Dr. Z. in 2000 or 2002 in China, when he and Dr. \nA. stopped by Dr. Z.\u2019s home, and that they had in-person contact two or three times in \nChina. At his hearing, Applicant said he met Dr. Z. one time in about 2003 or 2004 at a \ntea house in China, when Dr. A. was setting up Company MS. Dr. Z. does not speak \nEnglish and Applicant does not speak Chinese, so they did not converse. Dr. A. referred \nto Dr. Z. in conversations with Applicant as his \u201cpharmaceutical company friend\u201d \nbecause he operated a Tibetan pharmaceutical company. Dr. A. has not been in touch \nwith Dr. Z. since 2006. At the hearing, Applicant stated he did not list Dr. Z. on his \nsecurity application or disclose him during his 2007 security interview because he had \nno recollection of their brief meeting.

My only interest \nwas helping [Dr. A.] and hopefully getting my money back, but if I didn\u2019t, \nthen it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. (GE 6) \n \nIn August 2004, Dr. W. wired his investment from a German account to Dr. A.\u2019s \nchecking account (line item 9). Dr. A. partially repaid the approximately $30,000 loan \nfrom Applicant by transferring $23,677 to Applicant's personal checking account in \nDecember 2004 (line item 10). Applicant testified that on his security clearance \napplication and in his 2007 interview, he listed only a $15,000 loan, because he did not \nremember that he had actually provided approximately $30,000 to Dr. A. (GE 4; AE C, \nD, E; Tr. 108-122, 129-130, 139-141) \n \n \nIn late 2006 or early 2007, Dr. A. closed the Chinese company because of lack of \nprofit and inability to run the business while residing in the United States for eight \nmonths of the year. After Company MS closed, Applicant did not close his Corporation \nM U.S. savings account, or move funds from that account. When he was interviewed in \n2008, he remembered that the funds were still in the Corporation M account. The \naccount had earned interest since 2004, and in October 2008, he closed the account \nand transferred $120,867 to his personal account. The Corporation M checking account \nhad $5,000 as of September 2005. In October 2008, Applicant realized that the \nCorporation M checking account still had funds, and he transferred the $5,000 into his \npersonal account. He testified that this $5,000 was a partial repayment of the $30,000 \nhe had loaned to Dr. A. Both Corporation M accounts are now closed. Applicant has no \nfinancial assets in China. (GE 6; AE D, E, F, J, L, N; Tr. 121-126, 141-142) \n \n \nApplicant has also provided Dr. A. with other funds. In 2001, Dr. A.\u2019s nephew \ncould not pay his tuition at medical school, and Dr. A. asked Applicant for help. \nApplicant's nephew was attending school in Russia. Applicant wired $2,000 from his \npersonal bank account to a Russian Foreign Students Department. Applicant did not \nnote in his 2008 interview whether Dr. A. repaid this loan. Applicant also paid the rent \nfor a photography business that Dr. A. operates in their local area. Applicant paid \n$4,000 per month for about 16 months in 2006 and 2007, for a total of about $64,000. In \ndescribing the money he has given to Dr. A. over the years, Applicant listed a $100,000 \nline of credit for Company MS, and an additional $100,000 for Dr. A.\u2019s \u201cpersonal and \nbusiness needs.\u201d Dr. A. has repaid about $20,000 to $30,000. Applicant does not \nrequire Dr. A. to repay these funds, because Applicant is financially comfortable. He \nearned $160,000 per year as of 2008, and he provided documentation showing that his \nnet worth at the time was approximately $1,200,000. He stated in 2008 that if Dr. A. \n\n \n \n12\n\u201cneeded money for something in the future, then I would probably help him out.\u201d (GE 2; \nAE D, E, F, J. M) \n \nIn December 1986, Applicant inappropriately touched a six-year-old child. He \ntestified that he was going through a stressful period related to child support and \ncustody issues with his ex-wife. He was a federal employee and held a security \nclearance. He was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault. The court \norder of October 1991 lists the charge as sexual assault of a child. At court in about \nApril 1987, he was given a choice of pleading guilty, and being held in jail each night for \none year; or pleading \u201cno contest\u201d and receiving \u201cshock probation,\u201d which required \nspending two continuous months incarcerated in the state penitentiary, followed by five \nyears of supervised probation, during which he would report to his probation officer \nmonthly. Applicant pled \u201cno contest\u201d and was sentenced to \u201cshock probation,\u201d starting \non August 13, 1987. Applicant was also required to attend counseling, which included \nweekly individual counseling for six months, and monthly group counseling for the \nremainder of his probation.12 Applicant satisfied the court\u2019s order. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE A, \nK; Tr. 61-68) \n \nOn October 18, 1991, the court ended Applicant's probation after he served \nslightly more than four years. The court order also set aside the conviction and \ndismissed the indictment. Applicant's attorney at the time told Applicant that he could, in \ngood faith, say that he had never been convicted, been in jail, or on probation because \nthese events were dismissed by the court. On his security clearance application, \nApplicant disclosed that he had been \u201ccharged with or convicted of\u201d a felony offense In \nDecember 1986. He noted the charge as \u201caggrivated [sic] sexual assault,\u201d listed the \nname and address of the court, and stated that it was \u201cdismissed 10-91.\u201d During his \n2007 security interview, he provided a copy of the court documents showing the case \ndisposition. He testified that he believed that providing the final disposition and the court \ninformation on his security clearance application would \u201cflag\u201d the arrest so that \ninvestigators could locate the court records for the details. His employer and family \nmembers are aware of these facts. (GE 1, 4; AE A, K; Tr. 61-68, 138-139) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China is geographically vast, with a population of more \nthan a billion people. Its authoritarian government, controlled by the Chinese \nCommunist Party, has a poor human rights record. It suppresses political dissent, \nengages in arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as forced confessions and torture of \nprisoners. The government does not respect freedom of speech, assembly, press, \nreligion, or academic or artistic freedom. Chinese authorities monitor communication \ndevices such as telephones, faxes, emails, text messages, and internet servers; and \n                                                 \n12 Applicant's testimony that he attended counseling for the entire probation period conflicts with his \naffidavit, in which he stated that he attended counseling from June 1987 to June 1988. (GE 2 at p. 104) \n\n \n \n13\nopen domestic and international mail. The U.S. Department of State warns that foreign \nvisitors may be placed under surveillance; hotel rooms may be monitored onsite or \nremotely; and personal items in hotel rooms may be searched without the owner\u2019s \nconsent or knowledge. Visitors are expected to register with the police within 24 hours \nof arrival in China. \n \nIn its 2012 Annual Report to Congress, the Office of the Secretary of Defense \nstated that the PRC is one of \u201cthe world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and economic \ninformation will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and persistent \nthreat to U.S. economic security.\u201d Based on cases prosecuted in 2007 and 2008, the \nU.S. Department of Justice indicated that China ranked second only to Iran as the \nleading destination for illegal exports of restricted U.S. technology.  \n \nA 2011 DoD report on Chinese military and security developments found that \nChina uses \u201ceconomic espionage, supported by extensive open source research, \ncomputer network exploitation, and targeted intelligence operations to obtain \ntechnologies to supplement [its] indigenous military modernization efforts.\u201d In \ndiscussing China\u2019s acquisition of defense technology, the report noted that the network \nof government-affiliated companies in its military-industrial complex often  \n \nenable[s] the PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] to access sensitive and dual-\nuse technologies or knowledgeable experts under the guise of civilian \nresearch and development. The enterprises and institutes accomplish this \nthrough technology conferences and symposia; legitimate contracts and \njoint commercial ventures; partnerships with foreign firms; and joint \ndevelopment of specific technologies.\u201d  \n \nThe same report stated that  \n \nChina continues to leverage foreign investments, commercial joint \nventures, academic exchanges, the experience of repatriated PRC \nstudents and researchers, and state-sponsored industrial/technical \nespionage to increase the level of technologies and expertise available to \nsupport military research, development, and acquisition. \n \nIn its 2009 Annual Report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission noted that \n \nChinese intelligence personnel are more inclined than other foreign \nintelligence services to make use of sympathetic people willing to act as a \n\"friend of China.\" While this most clearly has been seen in PRC-targeted \nrecruitment of Chinese-Americans, PRC agents also have used U.S. \ncitizens of other ethnic backgrounds as sources. \n \n\n \n \n14\nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be an impartial and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.13 Decisions \nalso reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole-person\u201d factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines are followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent policy \nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest14 for an applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it falls to \napplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.15 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to safeguard \nclassified information. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation in favor of the Government.16 \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \n                                                 \n14 Directive \u00a7 6.3. \n15 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n16 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n17 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n \n15\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nI have considered the conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that may be disqualifying, \nespecially the following: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. Applicant \nplaced himself in a position of risk of foreign exploitation when he had close and \ncontinuing contact with his roommate, Dr. A., who was a foreign citizen until 2008. \nApplicant traveled to China six times with Dr. A., and with Dr. A.\u2019s friends and \nprofessional associates, all of whom were Chinese citizens. They stayed several \nweeks at a time, and Applicant sometimes stayed at their homes, and socialized with \nthem and their family members. He also met the Company MS Chinese on-site \nmanager and employees. He participated in \u201cnew business\u201d fairs that promoted \nCompany MS. He sat in on business meetings with city officials about the company. \nThe fact that the country at issue is China is an important factor in a heightened risk \nanalysis. China is an aggressive perpetrator of economic espionage. Through such \nespionage, it obtains sensitive technologies to enhance its military modernization \nefforts. It targets both Chinese-Americans and those of other ethnic backgrounds to \ngain sensitive information.  \n \n\n \n \n16\nDr. A was a Chinese citizen during the years the foreign business, Company \nMS, was being developed. Applicant's name was listed as the CFO and a member of \nthe board of directors of the U.S. company that partnered with Company MS. \nTherefore, Applicant's name was submitted to Chinese government officials in relation \nto supporting this business as a joint venture and obtaining the government\u2019s joint-\nventure benefits. Applicant's activities with Dr. A., his family, and his friends, and his \nassociation with the Chinese company, created a heightened risk of foreign influence \nor coercion. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) also applies. Applicant's conduct in the years between 1999 and 2008 \ndemonstrates his close relationship with Dr. A., who was a Chinese citizen. They lived \nand traveled together and had a sexual relationship for seven years during that time \nperiod. In addition to the $170,000 related to the Chinese company, Applicant paid \nabout $100,000 in rent and other expenses for Dr. A. Contrary to Applicant's assertion, \nthese facts show that they had a close, spouse-like relationship. It is significant that \nApplicant chose to assist Dr. A. with his business, despite knowing that involvement \nwith a foreign company would pose a security concern for him if he applied for a \nclearance. Applicant's conduct raises a potential conflict of interest between his desire \nto help Dr. A. and the need to protect sensitive information.  \n \nApplicant shared living quarters with a Chinese citizen from 1999 to 2008. At the \ntime, Applicant did not hold a security clearance, but had access to proprietary and \nsensitive information. Applicant continued to share living quarters with Dr. A. after he \nbecame a United States citizen in 2008, and currently they remain roommates. Based \non his conduct over the past 13 years, it is clear that Applicant has feelings of affection \nand obligation for Dr. A. The risk of coercion or manipulation is greater where an \napplicant has daily close contact with a person who represents a security concern. \nAlthough Dr. A. is now a U.S. citizen, he represents a security concern because he has \nfamily members who are citizens and residents of China with whom he maintains \ncontact. He is in touch with one sister about yearly, but talks with his other sister \nmonthly, exchanges emails with his nephew several times per year, and talks with him \nmonthly. AG \u00b6 7(d) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(d) also applies because Applicant shared living quarters with numerous \nChinese citizens during his six visits to China. He lived in the Company MS townhouse, \nprovided by the Chinese government, on each visit between January 2004 and June \n2006. For two to three weeks during these visits, he shared the residence with the \nCompany MS operating manager, Dr. A., and five or six Chinese employees. Each visit \npresented a risk of foreign manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nApplicant provided approximately $140,000 as a line of credit for the Chinese \nCompany MS. Applicant wired two additional loans from his Corporation M savings \naccount to a Chinese bank: $15,000 of his own funds and another $15,000 to cover the \nprospective contribution from Dr. W. Applicant was willing to place a substantial portion \nof his assets at Dr. A.\u2019s disposal to assist a foreign-owned and -operated business. \n\n \n \n17\nApplicant provided these funds at a time when Dr. A. was a Chinese citizen. Most of \nthe $30,000 loan has been repaid, and the two companies no longer exist. Although \nApplicant has no current foreign investments, AG \u00b6 7(e) applies to the period when \nApplicant provided substantial funds to enable a joint venture with a foreign business. \n \n \n \nI have also considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant no longer has contact with Dr. A.\u2019s friends and associates who joined \nhim in the Chinese business venture. However, his conduct demonstrates that he has \nstrong ties to Dr. A., who has family in China. Applicant met Dr. A.\u2019s family during at \nleast three of his trips to China. He has been willing to help Dr. A.\u2019s family in the past. \nThe nature of a country\u2019s government is relevant in assessing vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion.17 The risk of coercion is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, or conducts intelligence operations against \nthe United States. China has an authoritarian government that seeks out both Chinese-\nAmericans and other ethnic groups in its attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information. Applicant could be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween foreign and U.S. interests. AG\u00b6  8(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has worked for the United States government for years, both as an \nemployee and as a contractor. He has held a security clearance in the past. He \n                                                 \n17 ISCR Case No. 09-06831 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011) (\u201cthe nature of the foreign government and its \nintelligence-gathering history are important considerations that must be brought to bear on a Judge\u2019s \nultimate conclusions.\u201d)  \n\n \n \n18\ntestified that he enjoyed his work and wished to continue. However, Applicant's \nrelationship with Dr. A. raises a potential conflict of interest. Applicant has shown that \nhe was willing to acquiesce to requests from a foreign citizen to become involved in a \njoint venture with a foreign company, and provide access to significant sums of money \nas part of the venture. He became involved despite the fact that he knew his \ninvolvement with a foreign company could pose a security concern. Given his conduct \nover the past 13 years, resulting from his strong ties to Dr. A., I cannot confidently \nconclude that he would resolve a potential conflict of interest in favor or the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply. \n \n \nDr. A. has ongoing contact with his sister and nephew in China, speaking with \nthem monthly, and exchanging emails with his nephew. Although there is no evidence \nthat Applicant has contact with them, he has demonstrated his willingness to help Dr. \nA.\u2019s foreign family. Applicant provided funds to Dr. A.\u2019s nephew tuition at a Russian \nmedical school as a favor to Dr. A., even though Applicant had met Dr. A.\u2019s nephew \nonly once before he wired the funds. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \n \nCorporation M and Company MS no longer exist. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies because \nApplicant currently has no financial interests in a foreign business.. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n\n \n \n19\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application in January 2006, \nhe and Dr. A. had been roommates and sexual partners for about seven years. But \nApplicant did not select the choice that would have accurately described his \nrelationship with Dr. A. -- \u201cAdult Currently Living with You.\u201d Instead, he indicated Dr. A. \nlived with him by listing the same address as his own; however, he listed it in another \nstate. His claim that he wanted to disclose that Dr. A. lived with him is contradicted by \nhis failure to list Dr. A. as \u201cAdult Currently Living with You.\u201d During his investigation, \nApplicant also gave conflicting information about their relationship. He described them \nas \u201ccohabitants\u201d in 2007, but in 2008 he claimed his statement was inaccurate, \nbecause they were not in a spouse-like relationship. However, they had shared a home \nand had a sexual relationship for seven years, Applicant paid Dr. A.\u2019s living expenses, \nhe visited Dr. A.\u2019s family in China, and placed large sums of money at Dr. A.\u2019s disposal. \nThe facts show that they did share a close, spouse-like relationship, and were bound \nby ties of affection and obligation, and Applicant deliberately failed to disclose it. \n \nIn his security clearance application and during his 2007 security interview, \nApplicant disclosed that he loaned Dr. A. $15,000 for the Chinese business. However, \nthis amount is substantially less than the $140,000 he actually placed in the \nCorporation M account. Applicant was aware that involvement with a foreign company \nrepresented a security issue, and expressed that concern to Dr. A. in 2004. I find that \nApplicant deliberately minimized his financial involvement with a foreign company \nwhen he reported a substantially lower amount on his application and during the \ninterview.  \n \nDuring his investigation, Applicant did not disclose that he had met and \nsocialized with several foreign citizens associated with Company MS during his trips to \nChina, and that he was a co-member with them on the Corporation M board of \ndirectors. He testified that he did not report them because he did not have close and \ncontinuing contact with them. The security clearance application does limit the \n\u201cassociate\u201d category to those with close and continuing contact. I conclude Applicant \nwas not required to list the foreign nationals on his security clearance application, \nbecause their interactions did not meet the \u201cclose and continuing contact\u201d requirement. \n \nHowever, the 2007 foreign influence interrogatories asked Applicant to list \nbusiness or professional associates who were foreign citizens or residents, and did not \nlimit that category to those with whom Applicant had close and continuing contact. \nNevertheless, he failed to disclose his contacts with the Chinese citizens involved in \nCorporation M and Company MS. I conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose the foreign nationals on his interrogatory response when he failed to list any \nforeign citizens or residents with whom he had a business or professional association.  \n \nApplicant also did not disclose his contacts with the foreign associates in his \n2007 subject interview. He did disclose his contact with Dr. A., who was a foreign \ncitizen at the time. I cannot determine if Applicant was asked at this security interview \nabout contacts with other foreign citizens. He did discuss the foreign business \n\n \n \n20\nassociates at his two-day interview in 2008. From the evidence presented, I cannot \nconclude that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his foreign business associates \nduring his 2007 security interview. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application, he disclosed his \ncriminal history by answering \u201cYes\u201d to the question that asked if he had ever been \n\u201ccharged or convicted of\u201d a felony. He then provided the name and date of the charge \nand stated it was dismissed. He also provided the name and the location of the court \nthat held the documentation about his court case. He could have been more precise by \nproviding details about his conviction and probation. However, I conclude that \nApplicant provided the government with sufficient notice of his criminal conduct, and \nwas not deliberately attempting to conceal his history.  \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his degree of financial involvement in \nCorporation M and Company MS; the extent of his relationship with Dr. A.; and his \nassociation with several foreign nationals on the board of directors of Corporation M. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (b) apply. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions are relevant: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. The record contains no evidence that Applicant \nsought to correct or supplement any of his documentation. In 2007, Applicant was sent \ndetailed interrogatories specifically related to foreign influence. He did not list the \nforeign contacts he made related to Company MS and stated he loaned Dr. A. only \n$15,000 for the foreign company. In 2012, Applicant had an opportunity to review, \ncorrect, and supplement the report of his 2007 security interview. He made a few minor \nchanges, but did not disclose his contacts with foreign citizens in China, or his financial \ninvolvement with the foreign company. AG \u00b6 17(c) cannot be applied. Although most of \nthe case documentation dates from 2006 through 2008, Applicant had a more recent \nchance to disclose the true facts when he reviewed his interrogatories in 2012. He \nagain was not forthcoming. Falsification of information provided to the government \ncannot be considered minor misconduct because it undermines the security process, \nwhich depends on frank and candid answers. Applicant's failure to be forthcoming \ncasts doubt on his reliability and good judgment. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n21\nWhole-Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited \nguidelines, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nIn evaluating the whole person, I considered that Applicant has provided \nevidence of a strong work ethic and high-quality job performance. He is a U.S. citizen \nand has lived and been educated in the United States. He has been U.S. government \nemployee, a DoD contractor, and has held a security clearance. \n \n \nHowever, the facts presented raise serious security concerns. Applicant was a \nmature adult of more than 50 years when he developed a spouse-like relationship with \nDr. A., a Chinese citizen. Because of that close relationship, he acquiesced to \nbecoming involved with a foreign business that Applicant knew raised security \nconcerns. He agreed to Dr. A.\u2019s request to put up a substantial portion of his assets at \nthe time \u2013 approximately $170,000 in total \u2013 to help Dr. A. qualify for joint-venture \nbenefits from the Chinese government. He met with Dr. A.\u2019s sisters and their families \nduring at least three of his visits to China. He wired funds to a Russian school to help \nDr. A.\u2019s Chinese nephew with tuition. He visited the Chinese embassy 12 times in \nrelation to his six trips to China, where he participated in foreign business fairs, sat in \non foreign business meetings with Chinese officials, resided with Chinese workers, or \nresided in hotels \u2013 which are monitored and searched by the Chinese government.  \n \n \nApplicant also developed a close relationship with Mr. QL, a Chinese nurse. \nBetween 2002 and 2004, Mr. QL lived in Applicant's home for several weeks on two \ndifferent occasions. Applicant also paid him and provided him with other benefits while \nhe cared for his mother, and they were in close contact during that period. Mr. QL had \na key to Applicant's home, and he used Applicant's telephone to call family in China. \n\n \n \n22\nApplicant stayed with Mr. QL\u2019s family in China for one week. They discussed U.S. and \nChinese medical standardization, and Applicant sent him materials about the topic. In \n2007, Applicant offered his home as a residence for Mr. QL\u2019s son, who wished to come \nto the United States.  \n \n \nCurrently, Applicant remains in a relationship with Dr. A., who is now a U.S. \ncitizen, no longer involved with a foreign company, and operates a business in the \nUnited States. However, Dr. A. has family in China with whom he maintains contact. \nApplicant has helped Dr. A.\u2019s family in the past, which raises questions as to future \ninvolvement. Doubts also remain about the poor judgment Applicant exercised by his \nwillingness to engage in conduct that he knew to be a security concern because of his \nattachment to a foreign citizen. A fair and commonsense assessment of the available \ninformation shows Applicant has not eliminated the security concerns raised under the \nguidelines for personal conduct and foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.f  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 20, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On May 12, 2008, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which established that he was\nmaking significant efforts to resolve his outstanding tax debts.  In support of his contention,\nApplicant summarizes the evidence he presented below, and argues that it is sufficient to support a\nfavorable decision under the whole-person concept.  Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations, including the failure to pay state and federal taxes for multiple years.  At the time the\ncase was submitted for decision, Applicant still had a substantial outstanding debt, and had only\nrecently undertaken significant action to try to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered\nthe possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to\nmany of the SOR allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App.\nBd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 3, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 10, 2008, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.4 Applicant provided a two-page letter with four \nenclosures. Applicant\u2019s submission was received at DOHA on April 30, 2008. \nDepartment counsel did not object to consideration of the documents Applicant \nsubmitted in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted responsibility for seven \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e, 1.g and 1.h), said he paid one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and was \ncurrent on his debt payments for one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j)(Item 2).

The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Mar. 13, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated Apr. 1, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nhe had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n5Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nnot used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has never used illegal drugs while in \na sensitive position.  \n \nOn his security clearance application, he disclosed that a lien had been placed \nagainst his property for failure to pay debts. He described a $74,000 lien for tax years \n1995 to 1998. He also said he was current with all taxes for the last seven years (1999 \nto 2005). For financial delinquencies, he disclosed a delinquent credit card debt for \n$3,712.  He explained, \u201cI realize that my debts should be paid on time. I just want to say \nthat I have spent the last 26 year[s] raising my 4 children and helping them through[] \ncollege and their entrance into adult life. My income has gotten better and my burden is \nless.\u201d (Item 4 at page 35).   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR lists nine debts that were delinquent in the last 25 years, and a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy. He was self-employed between 1986 and 1998 (FORM Response). He \nfiled tax returns, but did not pay or sometimes fully pay his taxes (FORM Response). \nSome of his tax debts were subsequently paid and some lapsed due to the Internal \nRevenue Services\u2019 (IRS) failure to file a levy on his accounts. In 2008, he refinanced his \nhome and paid his last remaining, legally enforceable federal tax debt. Specific \ninformation about each of the SOR allegations listed in \u00b6 1 follows:  \n \na. On April 14, 1993, the Federal IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for \n$64,698 for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1984, 1986, and 1987 through \n1991. On May 19, 1997, and August 15, 1999, the IRS issued Certificates of Release \nfor the tax liens because more than ten years had elapsed since the assessments.  The \nunpaid balance of assessment was $64,698 according to the certificate filed on August \n15, 1999. \n \nb. On June 2, 1986, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $4,399 \nfor taxes and additions assessed for the tax period ending on March 31, 1985. On \nMarch 10, 2002, the IRS issued a Certificate of Release for this tax lien.  \n \nc. In March 1993, Applicant\u2019s state tax authority filed a state tax lien against \nApplicant for $10,516. As of August 31, 2007, his state tax authority reported Applicant \nhaving no outstanding tax liability to his state of residence.  \n \nd. On April 30, 1993, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $5,021 \nfor taxes and additions assessed for tax year 1992. On August 15, 1999, the IRS issued \na Certificate of Release for this tax lien.  \n \ne. On May 23, 1996, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $18,896 \nfor taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1993 and 1994. In May 2005, Applicant \npaid the account balance owed for taxes and additions assessed for tax year 1993. In \nAugust 2007, his account balance of $5,144.00 for taxes and additions assessed for tax \nyear 1994 was cleared due to a statutory expiration. On September 6, 2007, the IRS \n\n \n4 \n \n \nissued a Certificate of Release for the tax lien, which listed an unpaid balance of \nassessment of $18,896.  \n \nf. Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in May 1996. This Bankruptcy \ndischarge was effective in August 1996.  \n \ng. In March 1999, Applicant\u2019s state tax authority filed a state tax lien against \nApplicant for $7,497. As of August 31, 2007, his state tax authority reports Applicant \nhad no outstanding tax liability to his state of residence.  \n \nh. On February 18, 2005, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for \n$74,730 for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. In \nSeptember 2007, his account balance of $11,260.00 for taxes and additions assessed \nfor tax year 1995 was cleared due to a statutory expiration. As of September 17, 2007, \nApplicant still owed $58,825.00 for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1996, \n1997, and 1998.  On February 29, 2008, he paid the IRS $35,457, resolving this debt. \n \ni. As of August 20, 2007, Applicant owed about $1,362 on a credit card account. \nOn November 22, 2007, Applicant paid this debt in full (Item 2 (Encl to SOR Response, \nletter from creditor, dated Dec. 3, 2007)). \n \nj. As of August 20, 2007, Applicant owed about $4,000 on an account that was \npast due. On July 30, 2007, he paid $681, and the creditor indicated on August 22, \n2007, the debt was $2,067 (Item 6). \n \nApplicant had ample warning about the security concerns of his delinquent debt. \nOn August 8, 2007, he responded to interrogatories from DOHA (Item 5). He explained \nthat his four children attended college in the following years: (1) 1998-2002; (2) 1999, \n2004-2007; (3) 2001-2006; and (4) 2003-2007. He described August 2007 as his \u201cfirst \nmonth of financial freedom from our Children in 27 years.\u201d  His plan was to borrow \nagainst the equity in his home to pay his tax debt.  A mortgage statement attached to \nItem 6 indicates on July 30, 2007, Applicant\u2019s mortgage balance was $121,302; his \nmonthly payment was $1,708; and this included a payment on a past due amount of \n$6,661 (about half of this amount was for past due late charges).  He subsequently \nbrought his mortgage to current status.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax returns for the last seven years show the following adjusted gross \nincome (AGI): 2001-$104,857; 2002-$105,940; 2003-$122,822; 2004-$64,112; 2005-\n$69,252; 2006-$98,701; and 2007-$147,467 (Item 6 and FORM Response). His AGI \nover those seven years totals $713,151 and his average AGI is $101,878. Applicant \npaid all state taxes owed from 2000 to 2006 (Item 6, statement from state tax authority, \ndated Aug. 1, 2007).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross salary is $12,582, his monthly net salary is $8,800, his \nmonthly expenses are $3,710 and his monthly debt payments are $3,483 (Item 6).  His \nmonthly net remainder is about $1,600 (Item 6). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant refinanced his home and on February 29, 2008, and paid the IRS \n$35,457, resolving his last remaining, legally enforceable delinquent tax debt (Form \nResponse). The IRS provided a release for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2001 \n(Form Response). Applicant does not currently have any delinquent debt. See credit \nreport dated April 15, 2008, showing no delinquent debt (Form Response). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n6 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides one Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case. The government \nestablished AG \u00b6 19(c), which states, \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 19(g) does not apply because Applicant did file a federal tax return each year. \nApplicant\u2019s profound history of delinquent tax debt is documented in his response to \nDOHA interrogatories, his SOR response and his FORM response. He has a history of \nexcessive and chronic indebtedness. Although he recently made significant progress \nresolving his SOR-listed debts, his tax debts were delinquent for so many years that his \nrecent efforts do not fully undercut the government allegations. AG \u00b6 19(c) fully applies.   \n \n7 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant avoided paying some of his federal taxes because the IRS failed to \naggressively pursue payment though filing of tax levies.8 He became aware of the \nsecurity significance of his financial problems on August 9, 2007, when he responded to \nDOHA inquiries concerning his delinquent debts. The importance of resolving his debts \nwas reinforced when he responded to the SOR on December 3, 2007. His effort to \nresolve his debts in February 2008, when he refinanced his residence, was the type of \naction he should have taken earlier. His decisions over most of the last ten years to \nemphasize paying for his children\u2019s college educations over his responsibilities to pay \nhis delinquent federal and state taxes is not an appropriate prioritization of payments. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) because \n \n8 A levy must be made or proceeding in court begun to collect a federal tax lien within 10 years \nafter a tax assessment is made. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502; United States v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114, 119 \n(2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a bankruptcy proceeding, see United \nStates v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d 796 (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements (made before Dec. 20, 2000), see \nUnited States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101, 1106 (11th Cir. 2007), or while an offer in compromise (made on or \nafter Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. Id. I infer that collectibility of some of his federal tax liens was barred by \nthe 10-year statute of limitations.    \n    \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nhe did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts.9 His \noverall conduct pertaining to state and federal taxes over the last ten years casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nApplicant does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he did not \nprovide evidence that he received financial or credit counseling. There is record \nevidence of \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d and \nhe receives substantial credit because his current financial condition as of February 29, \n2008, is excellent.  \n \nGuideline \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to \nestablish that Applicant showed good faith10 in the resolution of his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \nnot applicable because he did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis \nof the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to his \nSOR debts.  \n \nApplicant did not show sufficient responsibility under the circumstances to fully \nmitigate security concerns. He has been employed for the last seven years, and his \nadjusted gross income for those seven years averaged over $100,000 per year. He \nshould have showed a consistent track record of significant, delinquent tax debt \nreduction. His financial problems may recur. He should have been more diligent and \nmade greater efforts over a longer period of time to resolve his delinquent debts. He has \nnot carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of \nthe record evidence as a whole, I conclude the passage of time has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to most of his financial problems, and I find For Applicant \n \n9\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \non all SOR paragraphs except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h. No mitigating conditions \nsufficiently apply to remediate all security concerns. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. His stable marriage \nand his dedication to the welfare of his four children support approval of his clearance. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. Aside from his tax problems, he is a law \nabiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant was well aware of his tax responsibilities, and had ample resources to pay his \nfair share of taxes.  He did not become truly serious about paying his back taxes until he \nbecame aware of the security significance of these debts. His efforts to resolve his tax \ndebts were insufficient when compared to available income that he could have used to \naddress his delinquent debts, especially from 2001 to 2003. He did not show adequate \nactions for timely resolution of his tax debts. Instead he chose to rely on the IRS\u2019 failure \nto file tax levies against his income and property. In sum, he did not make sufficient \nefforts to repay or resolve tax debts prior to 2008, and those actions were not adequate \nto fully resolve security concerns.         \n \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 25,\n2005. On May 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nDecember 31, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 1, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July\n17, 2008. I received the case assignment on July 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on July 24, 2008, for a hearing on August 27, 2008. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered eight exhibits (Exhs 1-8) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted 22 exhibits (Exhs. A-V) that\nwere admitted without objection. She testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 8, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to\nkeep the record open until September 25, 2008, to submit additional evidence. On\nSeptember 19, 2008, she submitted five additional exhibits (W 1-5). They were admitted\nwithout objection. At my request a current report on her finances was requested and\nsupplied (Exh. X). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a government contractor working as a\ncomputer data modeler in support of an Air Force program since May 16 2006.\nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted four and denied three financial allegations in\nthe SOR relating to over $ 35,000 in delinquent debts. She disputes one of the denied\ndebts and avers that the other two have been paid. She admitted the single personal\nconduct allegation related to testing positive for cocaine in January 2005 from a use in\nDecember 2004. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from her employment is approximately $78,000. She\nhas modest savings of over $2,000. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer\nscience in 1986. After graduation she was employed by a major U.S. company until\n1993. Between 1993 and 1997, she worked for several companies as an independent\ncontractor traveling extensively in the U.S. She then held positions between 1997 and\n2003 in data modeling and management and with two companies that paid her over\n$80,000 per annum. She was terminated for absenteeism on July 24, 2003, and was\nunable to find work for 22 months until she obtained her present employment 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s absenteeism was the result of a serious auto accident in the late\n1990's, followed by a second more serious accident in 2001 that resulted in spinal\nsurgery and extensive therapy (Exh. O). She was able to take two months of medical\nleave under the Family Medical Leave Act, but her employer did not provide any\nadditional sick leave so she missed a significant number of work days. It was during this\ntime that her husband left her with two daughters ages eight and three. \nApplicant received unemployment compensation for some of the duration of her\nunemployment (Exh. P), but went into debt to support herself and her children. During\nthis period she sold her home and made a profit of $13,000 which partially\nsupplemented her unemployment compensation. She now rents her home for $1,200\nper month.\n\n3\nApplicant is now a single mother with two daughters ages nine and fourteen. The\nfather of her older daughter is her divorced husband. The father of the younger\ndaughter is a former fianc\u00e9 whom she did not marry. Applicant first married her husband\nin 1993 and was divorced in 1996. She married him again in 2000 and he moved out in\n2002 after her second auto accident. He expressed a desire to adopt the second\ndaughter but did not. However, he has a paternal interest in her since she has never\nknown another father. He paid child support for his own daughter during the period\nbetween 1996 and 2000 but has not paid any child support for either girl since that time.\nHowever, he now voluntarily contributes health insurance through his employer for both\nchildren. \nApplicant met with a credit repair service in September 2007 and engaged the\ncompany in January 2008 (Exh. R). However, she discovered that their charges were\nexcessive and more than she could afford (Exhs. Q). She terminated the service after\npaying some fees but proceeded to resolve the debts on her own. She attempted\nnegotiation with some of her creditors with success. She has paid or settled all but two\nof the debts alleged plus some that were not alleged (Exh. D, Tr. 30). The remaining\ndebts are the two largest that were alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. c., and e). Both of those\ncreditors refused any settlement, compromise, or scheduled payments. Each insisted\non payment of the full amount of the debts which she could not do. Applicant now has\nsecured a bank loan for $18,000 made with her father as co-signer (Exh. W 1). She is\nmaking monthly payments on this loan until final arrangements are made for funds to be\ndisbursed to those creditors (Exhs. X 1 and 2). She has developed a budget showing\nsufficient income to pay her bills and the remaining two debts (Exh. W 2). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts as alleged on the SOR and their status are as\nfollows:\n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a. Cable service debt of $397. Paid in full (Exh. F) (Tr. 23). \n2. SOR \u00b6 1. b. Discover Card debt of $2,139. Settled for $1,083 (Exh. G) (Tr. 24).\n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c. USAA Savings Bank credit card debt of $14,790 charged off but\nattempts to negotiate have been conducted since January 2008 and now subject\nto negotiated settlement of $11,000 to be paid with new loan co-signed with\nApplicant\u2019s father.(Exh. H and W 1) (Tr. 24). \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d. AT&T bill of $585 was paid in full in January 2008. (Exh. I) (Tr. 26).\n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e. Chase Bank credit card debt of $18,290 in collection. Attempts to\nnegotiate have been conducted since February 2008 and now subject to\nnegotiated settlement of $8,000 to be paid with new loan co-signed with\nApplicant\u2019s father (Tr. 27) (Exh. J and W 1). \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f. Target charge account of $1,126. Had a settlement offer that was\nwithdrawn but paid in full in June 2008 (Tr. 28) ( Exh. K).\n\n4\n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g. Applicant disputes this $540 debt in correspondence with collection\nagency over four months without success (Tr. 29). It is still in dispute but she will\nresolve it if the dispute is unsuccessful. \nApplicant\u2019s problems with her former husband has resulted in two civil allegations\nof unfitness. The first occurred in 2004 and the Child Protective Service (CPS) cleared\nher of culpability. The second occurred in January 2005 when she was given a hair\nfollicle test that found traces of cocaine that she had used at a party in December 2004.\nShe acknowledged this one time use. The CPS removed her daughters from her care\nand gave them to her former husband for two months at which time they were restored\nto her custody. She was employed several months later by her present employer who\ngives random drug tests to employees. She has never tested positive since then. This\npositive test for cocaine is the subject of the single allegation under Guideline E. \nApplicant had no reason to believe that this one time drug experimentation was\nan indicator of a drug abuse problem that required drug treatment or counseling and did\nnot have it. However, she has taken counseling for the stress issues in her life that has\ncaused her to make some bad choices (Exh. W 5). She has received medical attention\nfor these concerns and problems relating to work and stressors in her life (Exh. 7). She\nexpressed remorse for her 2004 drug use and has learned a great lesson since it cost\nher the custody of her daughters for a short period. \nApplicant is highly regarded by the senior government leader in the office where\nshe works to support a government program. Also, she is regarded as trustworthy,\nconscientious, and reliable by fellow employees who have worked with her over the past\nthree years. They admire her ability to be a successful single mother of two very active\ngirls, and hold a responsible position with a government contractor in industry (Exhs. T,\nU, and V).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR several\n\n6\nyears ago and had not resolved them with her creditors. Thus, the evidence clearly\nraises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(e) the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated when the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the problem, and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue. He disputed both debts through his credit repair service but\nlater acknowledged their existence and has taken steps to pay or settle them. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20.(a.), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Most of Applicant=s financial\nproblems arose as a result of her divorce and unemployment for 22 months before her\npresent employment in 2005. She has been working to resolve her accumulated\ndelinquent debts. She paid or settled all of them except the two largest credit card debts.\nShe attempted to settle them or pay them in installments but the creditors would not\nagree to anything except full one time payments. Through a loan co-signed by her father\nshe is now capable and prepared to resolve those debts and pay off the bank loan in\nregular installments. \nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is\na potentially mitigating condition under AG & 20 (c). Applicant engaged a credit repair\nservice but discovered that the charges were excessive and terminated the service.\nThen she proceeded to resolve the debts on her own. She has received professional\ncounseling for the stressful issues in her life that has been part of the cause of the\ndifficulties involved in this matter. \nAG & 20.(d) provides a mitigating condition where the evidence shows the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts. While it not necessary that all of the delinquent debts be resolved for mitigation to\napply, it is necessary that a significant portion of the debts be settled or paid. I conclude\nthat all of the above cited mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout and an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\n7\nConditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include under\nAG \u00b6 16 (c):\nCredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole person assessment\nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of condor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\nThe guideline also provides certain mitigating conditions two of which are\napplicable to this matter. The first is under AG \u00b6 17.(c) that the offense is so minor, or so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement. While any use of a harmful\ndrug is not minor, here the use occurred four years ago and was a one-time incident\nwhich is not likely to recur. The MC applicable. \nThe second MC is under AG \u00b6 17.(d) in that the individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused the inappropriate behavior\nand such behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant has acknowledged the behavior and\ntaken steps to alleviate the circumstances that caused it by counseling with a women\u2019s\ntherapy group to help her cope with some of the stressful issues in her life (Exh. W 5).\nShe did not seek drug counseling because she believed the one time experimental use\nwas not an indicator of a drug use or abuse. She admitted her positive test for use of\ncocaine in 2004, and the circumstances surrounding it on her SF 86 and in her answer\nand interrogatories. She has been candid about the marital difficulties she has had and\nher medical problems. The record is replete with information most of which she has\nvoluntarily supplied. The MC is applicable. II see no likelihood that any similar conduct\nwould recur or cause problems in the future. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be\n\n8\nan overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of\nthe guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance at this time. I recognize her present expressed interest to resolve these\nfinancial issues to restore her credit rating and obtain a security clearance. The\ndelinquent debts arose over several years both during and after her unemployment. She\nhas had a good salary over the past three years with her present employer and has\nresolved the majority of the debts. She is now able to resolve the remaining two debts,\nand will do so.  \nApplicant was impressive in her testimony about her family, her employment, the\ndifficult years of medical problems, and her unemployment. She is now well-employed in\na firm that values her services. She is able to stay out of debt with her current budget.\nThe incident with drugs occurred over four years ago. She is sincere in her regret that it\nhappened. She has learned a valuable lesson and will never let it occur again. There is\nno reason that she should not be granted a security clearance.\n                          Formal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\n\n9\n                       Conclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted. \nCHARLES D. ABLARD  \nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 29 years old and unmarried. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Mail Room Supervisor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted her Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-\n86) on January 23, 2006.  On November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on January 19, 2008, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on April 25, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 1, 2008, and the\nhearing was scheduled for June 2, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\nseven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.  The Applicant\npresented two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.  She also testified\non her own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 12, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 29 years old and unmarried.  She is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Mail Room Supervisor and is seeking to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant is indebted to 31 separate creditors totalling approximately\n$40,000.00.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 22, 2006; August 20,\n2007; October 3, 2007; and March 5, 2008, reflect each of these delinquent debts.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7).  The Applicant denies many of the delinquent debts\nlisted in the SOR, specifically allegations 1(b), 1(c), 1(f), 1(h), 1(i), 1 (j), 1(k), 1 (l), 1(m),\n1(n), 1(q), 1(r), 1(s), 1(u), 1(w), 1(x), 1(z), 1(dd), and 1(ee).  She admits the others.\nAlthough she testified that two of the debts were paid through garnishment, she\npresented no documentary evidence to establish that she has paid any of the debts\nlisted in the SOR. \nIn 1999/2000, the Applicant claims that two people, namely her best friend and\nher aunt, stole her identity and used it to obtain credit in her name, which is reflected\namong the debts listed in the SOR.  The Applicant is uncertain as to which debts listed\nin the SOR were fraudulently incurred by the perpetrators.  She filed a police report of\nthe incident.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nIn 2001, the Applicant got married, and they separated in February 2004.\nFollowing a one night stand, not with her husband, the Applicant found herself nine\nmonths pregnant and homeless for about a month in 2005.  When she did find a place\nto live, her living arrangements were not stable. Her divorce from her husband was final\nin February 2006.  Some of the debt listed in the SOR are joint debt incurred during the\nmarriage.  Other debts listed in the SOR, the Applicant is aware of and has not paid\nbecause she cannot afford to, and others she simply has no knowledge of.  She has few\nfinancial records as they were destroyed by water damage caused from a leak in the\nApplicant\u2019s trunk.  The Applicant has not contacted her creditors for over a year to\ndetermine the status of the debts or for any other reason.   \nThe Applicant started working for her current employer in January 2006.  She\nearns $14.25 per hour and works full time and overtime when she can get it.  In 2006,\n\n3\nshe moved into her present home, which is low income housing.  She is a single parent\nwho provides all of the financial support for herself and her son, including his medical\ninsurance, medicine and co-pays for health care.  She does not receive any public\nassistance such as food stamps or Medical.  After paying her regular monthly expenses\nsuch as her rent, car payment, groceries, cell phone and utilities, she often has to ask\nher mother and aunts for money.  She has no bank accounts or assets of any kind.  She\nindicates that she is willing to pay her debts, but can only make small payments\nbecause she does not have much money.  (Tr. p. 53).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nher personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions dated\nJanuary 23, 2006.  Section 28 (a) asked her if in the last 7 years, has he been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant responded, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit\n1).  This was a false answer.  Question 28(b) of the same application asked her if she\nwas currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant again answered,\n\u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 1).  This was also a false answer.  The Applicant should\nhave answered \u201cYES\u201d to both questions  as evidenced by the numerous delinquent\ndebts set forth in her credit reports.  The Applicant explained that when she completed\nthe security clearance application, she was assisted by an individual who worked at her\ncompany.  The Applicant contends that she told the individual that she had financial\ndelinquencies and that she was a victim of identity theft.  The individual told her to\nanswer, \u2018NO\u201d to the questions because she was presently current with her student loan\npayments and other debts.  The Applicant testified that the individual who assisted her\nin completing the application is no longer employed with the company as there is a big\nturnover.   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.  (a) Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n6\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has experienced some difficult times\nincluding identity theft, a separation and divorce, a pregnancy out of wedlock,\nunemployment and homelessness.  However, since 2006, she has been employed full\ntime but has done nothing to straighten up her delinquent financial affairs.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\nare applicable.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Her financial problems remain\ncurrent, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith\neffort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts. \nIn addition, the Applicant intentionally failed to answer questions 28(a) and 28(b)\naccurately and truthfully on her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing.\nRealizing the extensive nature of her delinquent debts and her past credit history, it is\nclear that she deliberately failed to acknowledge her delinquent debts in response to the\nquestions.  Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Disqualifying Conditions 16(a)\nDeliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I\nfind that the Applicant intentionally sought to conceal material information from the\nGovernment on his security clearance application.\n    I have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The Applicant has not even begun the process of financial rehabilitation\nand she has a long way to go before her financial affairs are in order.    \nThe Applicant has not demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\n\n7\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n   \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.y.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.z.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.aa.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.bb.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.cc.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.dd.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.ee.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.ff.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 8 May 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nH, and E.  Applicant submitted an undated answer, and requested a decision without\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 26 September 2008. The record in this case\nclosed 24 September 2008, the day Department Counsel indicated no objection to\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.b. He is a 37-year-old\ndata monitor employed by a defense contractor since October 2005. He has not\npreviously held a clearance.\nWhen Applicant completed a clearance application in October 2005 (Item 4), he\ndisclosed a one-time use of marijuana in August 2001 (question 24), his non-judicial\npunishment for a positive urinalysis in October 2001 (question 23), and his resulting\ngeneral (under honorable conditions) discharge from the military in December 2001\n(question 19). He failed to disclose that he had used marijuana in 1998, before enlisting\nin the military. He failed to disclose that he resumed using marijuana while in the military\nin 2001. He failed to disclose that he had used marijuana in summer 2005, just months\nbefore applying for his clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use while in the military resulted in positive urinalyses in\nAugust 2001, October 2001, and December 2001. He received non-judicial punishment\nfor these offenses in December 2001, and was processed for administrative separation\nfrom the military effective the end of December 2001.\nWhen military law enforcement officials began investigating Applicant\u2019s positive\nurinalyses in October 2001, Applicant denied having ever used any illegal drugs,\nincluding marijuana. Applicant made this false statement because he was trying to\nprotect himself (Item 5). When Applicant answered government interrogatories in\nOctober 2007 (Item 5), he misrepresented the extent of his drug use, claiming to have\nused marijuana once in summer 2005, and once in June/July 2001. He stated an intent\nto not use illegal drugs in the future.\nApplicant asserts that he has not used marijuana since summer 2005, and has\nno intent to do so. He claims he does not associate any more with marijuana smoking\nacquaintances. He cites his increased maturity, his marriage in September 2003, and\nhis trying to start a family with his wife as reasons he will not use drugs in the future.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) .\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\n3\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b6 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n5\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\n3\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s sporadic marijuana use 1998 and summer 2005.  However,\n3\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns. There was nothing unusual about the\ncircumstances of his marijuana use, so I cannot conclude that the marijuana use is\nunlikely to recur.  He has not demonstrated intent to not abuse these drugs in the\n4\nfuture.  Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred in three different periods of his life, before,\n5\nduring, and after his military service. All the marijuana use occurred after he was 27\nyears old. Without some corroboration of his changed circumstances or his character\nand work, his past falsifications make it difficult to credit his claims of rehabilitation.\nUnder these circumstances I cannot conclude that Applicant is unlikely to use drugs in\nthe future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal\ndrug use during a criminal investigation in October 2001, and misrepresented the extent\n\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n6\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n4\nof his marijuana use in October 2005 and October 2007.  He did so knowing that these\n6\nissues were of security concern to the government.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. His eventual disclosures cannot be considered\neither forthright or prompt.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use and financial issues\ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an\ninterest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant\nbefore making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully\ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be\nprudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information\nabout himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its denial of Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance. Specifically, it alleged facts which raise concerns under Guideline F.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 28, 2007, and requested an\nadministrative determination. On March 19, 2008, the government prepared a File of\nRelevant Materials (FORM). Applicant replied on April 22, 2008, and the case was\nassigned to me on May 2, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nMay 29,2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.p through 1.q. I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old woman with five children. She is estranged from her\nhusband, who is currently incarcerated. They are seeking a divorce. She has custody of\nthree of her children. It is unclear from the record who has custody of the other children.\nShe works as a receptionist for a defense contractor. The record contains no evidence\nof her highest level of education.\nApplicant has approximately $15,000 of delinquent debt. She owes\napproximately $10,000 of this delinquency to an automobile creditor (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.r), and approximately $1,000 consists of several medical accounts\n(SOR subparagraphs 1.f through 1.l). All of these debts were accumulated while\nApplicant was living with her husband. He is not assisting with debt repayment (Reply).\nThe SOR alleges approximately $7,000 of delinquent child support payments\n(SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.n). Applicant denied these debts and provided evidence\nthat they were current. She provided no evidence supporting her contention that the\nother contested delinquencies, as noted above, were either satisfied, in the process of\nbeing satisfied, or were not her responsibility.\nApplicant contends that she is in the process of satisfying the admitted SOR\ndelinquencies. She provided no supporting documentation. Also, she presented no\ndocumentation of any financial counseling or other efforts to repair her finances.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n3\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The government reposes a high degree of\ntrust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). \nApplicant successfully contested SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.n. I resolve\nthese in her favor.\nThe remaining debts listed in the SOR continue to be delinquent. AG & 19(a), \u201can\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\n\n4\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were accrued during her marriage, and her estranged\nhusband, currently incarcerated, has not assisted her in satisfying them. She has not,\nhowever, provided any evidence that she has taken any steps to either resolve the\ndelinquencies or seek professional counseling. Consequently, although her financial\ntroubles were caused by circumstances beyond her control, she has not established\nthat she has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\ndoes not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to demonstrate efforts at rehabilitation also renders the\nremaining mitigating conditions inapplicable. She has not mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nWith five children to support, and an estranged, incarcerated husband who\nprovides no help, Applicant is facing an extraordinarily difficult situation. She has not,\nhowever, demonstrated any evidence of efforts to improve her situation. Although her\ncontention that she cannot currently afford to make progress on her debts is\nunderstandable, she failed to demonstrate efforts at exploring alternative avenues of\nmitigation including financial counseling, and assistance with budgeting. Absent\nevidence of payment or efforts at organizing her finances, I cannot conclude that the\nfinancial considerations security concern has been mitigated.\n\n5\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot\nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award\nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once and a\nlifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and\nmitigating, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant\u2019s current circumstances, a\nclearance is not recommended, but should she be afforded an opportunity to reapply in\nthe future, having developed a payment plan, sought counseling, and begun paying\ndelinquent obligations, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security\nclearance worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted. Having\nevaluated the whole person factors in the analysis set forth in the Financial\nConsiderations section above, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.o - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern under\nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer, requesting a hearing, on November 27,\n2008. I received the case assignment on December 20, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on January 24, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 7,\n2008. During the hearing, I received three government exhibits, three Applicant exhibits,\nand the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. Applicant attempted to move a fourth\nexhibit into the record. Department Counsel objected because she had not seen it\nbefore the hearing. I identified it, reserving judgment on its admissibility until\nApril 17, 2008\n\nThe proposed exhibit was 43 pages long.\n1\n2\nDepartment Counsel had an opportunity to review it after the hearing . Department\n1\nCounsel reviewed it and withdrew her objection, whereupon I received it. I received the\ntranscript on February 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nPreliminary Ruling\nSOR subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i allege delinquencies owed to \u201cunknown\u201d\ncreditors. Because these allegations are vague and overbroad, I have resolved them in\nApplicant\u2019s favor without further discussion. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old, married woman with one adult child. Both she and her\nhusband are professional truck drivers. He has a twelfth grade education (Tr. 34).\nIn 1997, Applicant and her husband started a trucking business. They financed\nthe purchase of two eighteen-wheelers for approximately $230,000. Typically, they\ndrove one together, and either leased the other or hired employees to drive it (Tr. 46,\n49).\nThe business struggled. Applicant and her husband had trouble finding\ncompetent employees, and they underestimated the vehicles\u2019 maintenance costs (Tr.\n46). When Applicant experienced a serious medical crisis in 2001, everything\n\u201csnowballed\u201d (Tr. 25). Because they had no medical insurance, they incurred\ntremendous out-of-pocket health care expenses and grew increasingly unable to pay\ntheir business expenses.\nIn October 2000, Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nprotection (Exhibit D). The court discharged approximately $290,000 of business and\npersonal debt (Exhibit D at 11). \nAlthough Applicant and her husband had to return one of the trucks to the\ncreditor as part of the bankruptcy process, they were able to continue operating the\nbusiness. They failed, however, to set aside funds in an escrow account to pay their\nfederal income taxes (Tr. 50). In 2002, they were unable to pay them when due (Id.).\nWith the help of their accountant, Applicant and her husband arranged an installment\nplan and paid an average of $200 per month (Tr. 49-51, 64).\nApplicant and her husband were again unable to pay their federal income taxes\nin 2003 and 2004. They arranged installment plans for those years also (Tr. 50). In\n2003, they \u201csaved up and splurged\u201d on two Caribbean vacations (Tr. 42, Exhibit 1).\n\n3\nWhen Applicant and her husband were unable to pay their federal income taxes\nin 2004, their accountant advised them that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not\nallow taxpayers to arrange installment plans for more than three consecutive years (Tr.\n51). They then did not file their 2004 income tax return (Tr. 56).\nApplicant experienced another major medical problem requiring surgery in 2005\n(Tr. 70). In early 2006, Applicant and her husband filed both their 2004 and 2005\nincome tax returns. At that time, they had paid approximately $2,735 toward the 2002\nand 2003 delinquencies through the installment plans (Exhibit E). Through their\naccountant, they then began negotiating an offer and compromise (Tr. 57). \nThe accountant worked on a settlement with the IRS for approximately a year\nbefore quitting abruptly (Tr. 57). In December 2007, the IRS froze their bank account,\nobtained a lien against their property for $61,838, and began garnishing Applicant\u2019s\nhusband\u2019s wages (Exhibit C, Tr. 29). Currently, Applicant\u2019s husband has paid\napproximately $970 through the garnishment (Exhibit B). Their bank account remains\nfrozen (Tr. 29, 33). \nApplicant also owes approximately $11,000 in delinquent medical expenses, as\nalleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.g. She denied the debt listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.d. She has not notified the creditor of her dispute.\nOver the years, Applicant has intermittently made payments ranging from $10 to\n$240 on her medical delinquencies (See Exhibit E at 6-13). She has not made any\npayments since June 2007 (Exhibit 6 at 9). She intends to resume payments after she\nand her husband satisfy their remaining income tax delinquencies.\nApplicant and her husband have retained another accounting firm to help resolve\nthe tax delinquencies (Exhibit A). Their goal is to satisfy the tax delinquencies, then\n\u201cmove on to a plan that will pay the medical [bills]\u201d (Tr. 25).\nApplicant has not sought money management counseling. Recently, he read a\nself-help book by a prominent money management expert, and has been incorporating\nthe book\u2019s lessons into their daily financial plan (Tr. 35). Applicant and her husband\nestimate their delinquencies wil be satisfied in three years.\nApplicant and her husband ended their business in 2005. Since then Applicant\nhas been working for the same company.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems, and failure to file her 2004 federal\nincome taxes on time triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d 19(e), \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d\nand 19(g), \u201cfailure to file Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were originally caused by her struggling business and her\nillness. When they became overwhelming, she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection\nin 2000. Shortly after the court discharged her debts, however, Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems recurred. In 2003, as Applicant was increasingly losing control of her finances\nagain, she spent money on two Caribbean vacations. Consequently, although her\nproblems were originally caused by circumstances beyond her control, she did not deal\nwith them responsibly enough for AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d to apply.\n\n5\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions and conclude they do not\napply either. Applicant and her husband have outlined a debt repayment plan, and have\nretained an accounting firm for assistance with their taxes. However, the plan is sketchy\nat best, and the only payments they has made thus far have been through her\nhusband\u2019s wage garnishment. Moreover, Applicant denied one of the delinquencies but\nhas taken no steps to resolve the dispute. I conclude Applicant\u2019s finances remain a\nsecurity concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s struggling business and her major medical problems contributed to\nher financial problems. Her limited education was also a factor. However, her financial\nproblems recurred after a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Although she has taken\nsteps to get her finances under control, it is too soon to conclude they no longer pose a\nsecurity concern in light of the remaining amount of the delinquencies and their\nrecurrent nature. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems remain a security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h - i.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 24, 2007 (mistakenly dated \nDecember 24, 2006), and again on January 23, 2008.  He admitted the 20 allegations \nunder Guideline F, but did not directly respond to the allegation under Guideline E.  \nHowever in his written response, he denied intentional falsification of his security \nclearance application.  He provided an explanation for his financial issues.  He \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on February 11, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on February 13, \n2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 19, 2008, for a hearing on May 1, \n2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered nine exhibits, \nmarked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 9, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant submitted one document, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A, \nreceived without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  The record was left \nopen for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant twice requested an \nextension to submitted additional documents which were granted.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted an additional document, marked App. Ex. B, which was admitted into the \nrecord without objection from Department Counsel (Gov. Ex 10).  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008.  The record closed on June 16, 2008.  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied \n \nProcedural issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel request that the SOR be amended to add another \nallegation, 1.u, under Guideline F.  Applicant had no objection to the amended.  The \namendment was granted and allegation 1.u was added to the SOR. (Tr. 8-12) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has been a training specialist for a defense \ncontractor for over four years.  He served 24 years on active duty in the Navy as an \noperation specialist and retired as a chief (E-7).  He has been married three times but \nhas no children born from any of the marriages.  He does have two stepchildren from \nhis present wife living at home that he supports. (Tr. 29-33; Gov. Ex. 1, security \nclearance application, dated March 31, 2006)  Applicant has monthly income of $5,582, \nwhich includes his retired pay from the Navy.  His monthly expenses are approximately \n$4,065, leaving him $1,387 in discretionary funds monthly.  His wife had worked in real \nestate but earned very little.  She is now employed full time and is starting to contribute \nabout $1,000 monthly to the family income. (Tr. 53-58)  \n \nCredit reports and the SOR show 21 delinquent debts for Applicant: a collection \naccount for a cell phone for $545 (SOR 1.a); a collection account to a finance company \nfor $330 (SOR 1.b); two medical accounts for collection for $70 and $164 (SOR 1.c and \n1.d); a collection accounts for $78 (SOR 1.e); a collection account on a returned check \nfor $332 (SOR 1.f); a charged off account for a university for $348 (SOR 1.g); a \ncollection account passed due more than 120 days for $437 (SOR 1.h); a collection \naccount for a sports store for $78 (SOR 1.i); an account more than 120 days past due \nfor a credit card for $2,012 (SOR 1.j); a charged off automobile loan for $14,936 (SOR \n1.k); a credit card debt for $1,142 more than 180 days past due (SOR 1.l); a delinquent \nautomobile loan charged off for $6,627 (SOR 1.m); a charged off health club debt of \n$974 (SOR 1.n); two collection account to the same creditor for $675, and $570 (SOR \n1.0, and 1.p); a collection account for $1,650 (SOR 1.q); an account more than 180 \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndays past due for $381 (SOR 1.r); a judgment for a furniture company of $3,257 (SOR \n1.s); a judgment for $1,142 (SOR 1.t); and a judgment to a landlord for $1,250 (SOR \n1.u). (Gov. Ex. 2, credit report, dated January 23, 1982; Gov. Ex. 3, credit report, dated \nSeptember 28, 1996; Gov. Ex. 4, credit report, dated April 22, 2006; Gov. Ex. 5, dated \nAugust 27, 2007; Gov. Ex. 6, Interrogatories with attachments, dated October 24, 2007; \nGov. Ex. 7, Judgment, dated January 11, 2004; Gov. Ex. 8, Judgment, dated November \n13, 2007; Gov. Ex. 9, credit report, dated April 23, 2008). \n \nApplicant admitted all of the debts listed in the SOR.  He intends to file a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy to address his debts. (Tr. 24-25; See, response to SOR, dated January \n25, 2008)  Applicant provided an explanation for his debts and his action plan to security \ninvestigators. (See, Interrogatories, dated October 24, 2007, at Enclosure A)  The \nproposed action plan was in some instances different than the explanation below \nprovided at the hearing. \n \nApplicant had no information on SOR allegation 1.a.  He had phone service with \none cell carrier and switched to another.  He thought the first carrier\u2019s bill had been paid.  \n(Tr. 33)  He has no information or explanation for the debts listed as SOR allegation 1.b \n(Tr. 34), SOR allegation 1.e (Tr. 40); SOR allegation 1.h (Tr. 41); SOR allegation 1.i (Tr. \n41); SOR allegation 1.j (TR. 41-42); SOR allegation 1.l (Tr. 42-43); SOR allegations 1.o, \n1.p, 1.q, 1.r (Tr. 43), and SOR allegation 1.t (Tr. 44).   \n \nSOR allegations 1.c and 1.d are for medical bills for his step-children or wife.  \nApplicant has health insurance for his family through his employer.  He has no \ninformation on the medical charges and he has not inquired about them from the \ncreditor. (Tr. 34-38)  SOR allegation 1.f is for a delinquent debt for a credit card.  \nApplicant has an active credit card with the creditor so he has no information or idea \nabout the delinquent debt.  He has not inquired about the debt. (Tr. 68-69)  SOR \nallegation 1.g is to a university.  Applicant took some on-line course from the university \nbut always paid by student loans.  He does not know why he has a charge from the \nuniversity.  He has not inquired about the debt. (Tr. 41)   \n \nSOR allegation 1.k and 1.m pertain to different automobiles that were returned to \nthe seller because of mechanical problems.  One car had mechanical problems and \nApplicant told the manufacturer to retrieve the car.  He believes the car was \nrepossessed and the debt is the remainder of the debt after the car was sold.  The other \ncar was purchased to replace the original car.  It also had mechanical problems and \nwas returned to the seller.  Applicant believes SOR allegation 1.m was the debt \nremaining after sale of that car. (Tr. 42-43)  \n \nSOR allegation 1.n is for a health club debt.  Applicant thought his fees were \nbeing paid by an automatic bank deduction.  However, he was unsure of any payments \nand had no documentation of payments made. (Tr. 43)  SOR allegation 1.s was a debt \nfor furniture.  Applicant stated the debt was paid in full but did not provide any \ndocumentation of payment at the hearing. (Tr. 43-45)   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR allegation 1.u is a judgment entered by Applicant\u2019s landlord.  Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s family came to live with Applicant and his wife for three months when they moved \nto the area.  Applicant\u2019s landlord told him he had to pay additional rent because there \nwere more people living in the house.  Applicant informed the landlord that the people \nwere there only temporarily and not living in the residence.  The landlord told Applicant \nhe had to pay the additional rent or move, and Applicant moved.  The judgment is for \n$1,250, the additional rent while the relatives lived in the residence.  Applicant paid a \ndeposit of $2,500 when he rented the residence.  Applicant claims he is owed money by \nthe landlord and the judgment was improperly entered against him.  The matter is still in \ndispute. (Tr. 18-19, 27-29) \n \nApplicant contacted a credit counselor to consolidate his debts for easier \npayments.  However, the credit counselor required up-front payment over a few months \nbefore any payments were made to creditors.  Applicant did not believe this was in his \nbest interest so he terminated. (Tr. 44-45, 50-52; Gov. Ex. 6, Interrogatories, at \nenclosure B) \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy after the hearing.  The record was kept \nopen for Applicant to provided documentation of the bankruptcy. ( Applicant Exhibit B, \nlist of debtors, undated)  The payment plan has not been finalized and no payments \nhave been made on the plan.  \n \nIn response to questions concerning his finances, Applicant listed the two car \nrepossessions noted in SOR allegations 1.k, and 1.m.  He did not list any judgments but \ndid comment that he was working with a consumer credit counselor to resolve debt and \nthat any debts were due to his divorce.  He further noted that he answered the \nquestions to the best of his ability.  In response to finance questions concerning the \nlength of delinquent debts, he answered no to having any delinquent debts in the last \nseven years over 180 days or delinquent debts currently over 90 day.  He further noted \nthat he was not aware of any debts over 45 days delinquent. (Gov. Ex. 1, security \nclearance application, dated March 31, 2006)  Applicant noted he was meeting a \ndeadline when he completed his security clearance application.  He was in a hurry and \nhad other task to do because he was retiring from the Navy and starting a new job.  He \ntold the clerk assisting him with the application that he may have other debts because \nhe was not able to get a current credit report.  He knew that security investigators would \nlook at his financial records and raise any issues concerning his debts. (Tr. 25-27) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts admitted by Applicant and listed in credit \nreports are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions \n(FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  There are 21 debts ranging from \nphone bills, to medical debts, to credit card debts, to car repossessions, to judgments, \nand additional rent.  The debts are not infrequent.  Most debts have not been paid and \nare not current.  The debts were incurred in the normal course of events, and not under \ncircumstances that may not recur again.  The number of debts and the size of the debts \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply.  Applicant noted an impact \non his finances because of his divorce and his wife\u2019s efforts to start a real estate career.  \nHowever, he did not provide specifics as to how these events impacted on his ability to \npay his debts.  In fact from the number and type of debts, it seems that these events \nwould have limited impact on his ability to pay the type of debts he incurred.  He did not \npresent information to show he acted reasonably under the circumstances. \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts since he has sufficient discretionary funds \neach month to use for debt reduction.  Applicant knew of the delinquent debt since he \nreceived interrogatories concerning the debts in October 2007.  He did nothing to \ndevelop a systematic concrete method to handle his debts until he filed for bankruptcy \nafter the hearing.  While the bankruptcy has been filed, the payment plan has not been \nfinalized and no payments have been made on the plan.  It is commendable that he has \ntaken action on his debts, but without a proven track record of debt payment, Applicant \nhas not established a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answer to a \nfinancial questions on his security clearance application raises a security concern under \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, to \ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  Applicant listed the debts he was well \naware of, the car repossessions, and noted that he was working with a credit counselor.  \nHe stated he answered the questions to the best of his ability.  While he did not list any \ndebts over 180 or 90 days past due, he did state that he was unaware of any debts over \n45 days.  He credibly testified that he complete the application in a hurry to meet a \ndeadline and did not check his credit reports.  He was aware of security procedures \nbecause he held a security clearance for over 20 year.  He knew security investigators \nwould question him about his credit since he raised the car repossessions.  While there \nis a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in \nany written document or oral statement submitted to the government when applying for \na security clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully.  Applicant listed the repossession and noted he was working \nwith a credit counselor alerting security investigators that he had some financial issues.  \nWhile he was not more specific because of lack of knowledge, he did not deliberately try \nto conceal his debts.  The available information shows his failure to list delinquent debt \nmore than 180 or 90 days past due was not knowing and willful.  Applicant established \nhe did not deliberately provide false information on the security clearance application \nwith intent to deceive.  I find for Appellant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potential disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant\u2019s 24 years of \nhonorable service in the Navy.  I considered Applicant recently filed for a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy as the plan to pay his debts.  However, his actions were so recent that it \ndoes not establish that he acted responsibly to address his financial matters.  Applicant \nin the future may be able to establish a consistent track record of debt payment under \nbankruptcy thus enabling him to be favorably considered for access to classified \ninformation.  But without such a track record now, he has not established responsible \naction on his debts.  His finances and his handling of his financial obligations create a \nsecurity concern.  Since he did not act responsibly towards his finances, he may not act \nresponsible towards his obligation to handle classified information.  He provided \nincomplete information on his security clearance application but not with the intent to \ndeceive.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  He has mitigated the security concerns for personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact During his testimony, Applicant changed some of the answers he previously filed in his written Answer to the SOR. Applicant admitted some of the allegations contained in the SOR and denied others. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: Applicant is 56 years old and divorced. He completed high school and a couple semesters of college. He has been married twice and has two children, ages 32 and 30, from his first marriage. He was married to his second wife from June 1999 to August 2003. They did not have children. (GE 1). In December 2007, he moved into his girlfriend\u2019s home. From approximately October 2002 to the present, Applicant has worked as a mailroom assistant for a federal contractor. He earns $12.50 per hour, for an annual salary of $26,250. Prior to this job, he worked as a clerk for a private company from October 2001 to February 2002. He was unemployed from June 2001 to October 2001, during which time he received unemployment compensation of approximately $150 per week. (Tr. 123). He was a dock building maintenance worker for a company from August 1984 to June 2001. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in 1999 while married to his second wife and subsequent to their August 2003 divorce.

On April 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about June 6, 2008, and requested a hearing.  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on July 16, 2008, and issued a Notice of Hearing on \nSeptember 23, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nJuly 16, 2008. The case was heard on July 31, 2008, as scheduled.  Department \nCounsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through F into evidence without objection. At the \nconclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until August 15, 2008, to give Applicant \nan opportunity to submit additional information. On July 31, 2008, post-hearing, \nApplicant submitted three exhibits that I marked as AE G through I, and admitted into \nthe record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on August 20, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant changed some of the answers he previously filed \nin his written Answer to the SOR.  Applicant admitted some of the allegations contained \nin the SOR and denied others. His admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and divorced. He completed high school and a couple \nsemesters of college. He has been married twice and has two children, ages 32 and 30, \nfrom his first marriage. He was married to his second wife from June 1999 to August \n2003. They did not have children. (GE 1). In December 2007, he moved into his \ngirlfriend\u2019s home.  \n \n \nFrom approximately October 2002 to the present, Applicant has worked as a \nmailroom assistant for a federal contractor. He earns $12.50 per hour, for an annual \nsalary of $26,250.  Prior to this job, he worked as a clerk for a private company from \nOctober 2001 to February 2002. He was unemployed from June 2001 to October 2001, \nduring which time he received unemployment compensation of approximately $150 per \nweek. (Tr. 123). He was a dock building maintenance worker for a company from \nAugust 1984 to June 2001. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 1999 while married to his second wife \nand subsequent to their August 2003 divorce. Without the advice of counsel, he \nexecuted a divorce settlement agreement, in which he assumed his ex-wife\u2019s many \ndebts. Afterwards, he began learning of the magnitude of those debts, which totaled at \nleast $10,000. (Tr. 24). Since his divorce, he has paid off several debts, including a \n$1,000 judgment. (GE 1 at 8). He paid a $6,000 state tax delinquency, which also \naffected his financial situation. (Answer). By next month, he will have paid a $1,200 \ngarnishment in full. (AE G). \n \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant received a set of Interrogatories inquiring about \nthe status of 32 delinquent debts. In response, he submitted a copy of his budget and a \npayroll stub, but did not address any of the debts. (GE 2).  He subsequently contacted \nsome credit counseling firms about resolving his delinquencies, but did not hire any of \nthem because he did not have the initial $200 to $300 fee. (Tr. 131). The week before \nthis hearing, Applicant met with a debt consolidation company. (Tr. 28). On July 31, \n2008, he signed an agreement and paid $100 to the firm to begin resolving his \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ndelinquent debts and credit problems. (Tr. 131; AE I). He admitted that he was not \ndiligent in pursuing a resolution and waited until the week of this hearing to take \nadditional steps. (Tr. 132). \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated October 2006 and September \n2007, the SOR alleges 29 debts, totaling about $29,000, which became delinquent \nbetween 2002 and 2007. Applicant denied many debts because he does not recognize \nthem and thinks some could belong to his father or brother. He telephoned some \ncreditors, but not all of them. The status of the debts is as follows:  \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $237 debt owed to a creditor that Applicant does not \nrecognize. He denied the debt.  It is unresolved. \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $698 debt owed to a gasoline company. He admits the \ndebt. It is unresolved.    \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $613 debt.  He admitted the debt. It is unresolved. \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $424 debt owed to a check cashing facility. He admitted \nthe debt. It is unresolved.  \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $119 debt owed for medical services he received. He \nadmitted the debt. It is unresolved.  \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $1,329 debt owed to a cable company. He denied the \ndebt. It is unresolved. \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $57 debt owed to the same cable company listed above. \nHe admits the debt. It is unresolved.  \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a $145 debt owed to satellite TV company. He denied the \ndebt. It is unresolved. \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a $720 debt owed to a cellular phone company. He denied \nthe debt and thinks it may be his former wife\u2019s debt. It is unresolved. \n10. SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a $195 debt owed for a personal loan. He admitted the \ndebt. It is unresolved. \n11. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a $658 debt owed to a gasoline company. He admitted the \ndebt. It is unresolved. \n12. SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a $735 debt owed to a credit card company. He denied the \ndebt. It is unresolved. \n13. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a $968 debt. He denied the debt. It is unresolved.  \n14. SOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a $1,028 debt owed to a gasoline company. He admitted \nthe debt. It is unresolved.  \n15. SOR \u00b6 1.o alleges a $103 debt owed to a telephone company. He denied the \ndebt. It is unresolved.   \n16. SOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a $922 debt owed to a credit card company. He denied the \ndebt. It is unresolved. \n17. SOR \u00b6 1.q alleges a $540 debt owed to a cellular phone company. He denied \nthe debt. It is unresolved. \n18. SOR \u00b6 1.r alleges a $13,350 debt owed on a car loan. He admitted the debt. \nHe sent the creditor $50 several months ago and called the company to seek \na payment plan. The company wanted $300 per month. It is unresolved. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n19. SOR \u00b6 1.s alleges a $555 debt owed to a cellular phone company. He denied \nthe debt. It is unresolved. \n20. SOR \u00b6 1.t alleges a $780 debt owed to a retail store. He denied the debt. It is \nunresolved. \n21. SOR \u00b6 1.u alleges a $1,529 medical debt. He denied the debt. It is \nunresolved. \n22. SOR \u00b6 1.v alleges a $488 debt. He denied the debt. It is unresolved.  \n23. SOR \u00b6 1.w alleges a $423 debt owed to a short loan company. He admitted \nthe debt. It is unresolved.  \n24. SOR \u00b6 1.x alleges a $328 debt owed to an insurance company. He admitted \nthe debt. It is unresolved. \n25. SOR \u00b6 1.y alleges a $207 debt owed to the same insurance company as \nabove.  He denied the debt.  It is unresolved. \n26. SOR \u00b6 1.z alleges an $851 debt. He denied the debt. It is unresolved.   \n27. SOR \u00b6 1.aa alleges a $79 debt. He denied the debt. It is unresolved.  \n28. SOR \u00b6 1.ab alleges a $144 medical. He denied the debt. It is unresolved.   \n29. SOR \u00b6 1.ac alleges a $562 debt. He denied the debt and believes it is related \nto a mix-up with his bank. It is unresolved.   \n \n \nIn summary, all of the 29 debts remain unresolved or unpaid. There is no \nsubstantive evidence that the debts Applicant denied have been disputed or are not his \ndebts.  \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $1,754, and includes about $300 he earns \nfrom disc jockey work. He does not pay rent to his girlfriend, who covers many of his \nliving expenses, and has loaned him money to pay debts. After paying his monthly \nexpenses and $200 to his girlfriend, he has about $454 remaining that could apply to a \nrepayment plan. (Tr. 135). He is convinced that he will be able to obtain financial \nsolvency in the future, humbly citing several difficult obstacles that he has overcome \nthroughout his life.  \n \n  \nIn September 2006, Applicant submitted a SF 86. In response to \u201cSection 28: \nYour Financial Delinquencies. A. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d he answered yes and listed one debt alleged in the SOR. \nHe did not list any other debts. In response to Section 27, requesting information about \nbankruptcies, garnishments, tax liens or judgments, he disclosed a current garnishment. \nWhen he completed a security clearance application in 2006, he knew he had a few \ndebts, but did not believe they were delinquent three to six months. He did not review a \ncredit bureau report until he met with a government investigator in September 2007. (Tr. \n129). He did not intentionally attempt to defraud the government. (Tr. 51).   \n \n \nSection 23(d) on the SF 86 inquired about his police record: \u201cHave you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d In response to \nthat question, he answered \u201cNo\u201d and did not disclose that in 1980 he was charged with \nDriving Under the Influence and ordered to attend an alcohol education class.  Applicant \ndid not disclose that incident because someone from his company\u2019s human resources \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ndepartment advised him that he did not need to disclose information more than eight \nyears old. He also checked with his site manager, who gave him the same information.  \n(Tr.  52). \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s site manager wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He considers \nApplicant to be a valued employee with a \u201ccan-do attitude.\u201d (AE D). In March 2007, the \ndeputy site manager nominated Applicant for a \u201cThank You Award\u201d for his outstanding \nservice to the company, noting that in a specific situation Applicant \u201cexceeded \nexpectations by performing a requested task competently and promptly.\u201d (AE F).  \nApplicant\u2019s Performance Evaluation from May 2007 to February 2008 documents his \naverage performance in most categories. His supervisor noted that he \u201chas never had \nan attendance problem and always adheres to policy.\u201d (AE A). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt in 1999 \nwhile married to his second wife and after their divorce. Those debts continued to \naccrue through 2007, and are noted on an October 2006 and September 2007 CBR.  All \nof the debts remain unresolved, despite Applicant\u2019s denial of numerous debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial worries arose around 1999 and continue into 2008. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply because the problems have been ongoing for almost nine years \nand do raise questions about his reliability and good judgment. Some of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are attributable to his second wife and their divorce agreement, and, \na period of unemployment in 2001. Those conditions were \u201cbeyond his control.\u201d \nHowever, there is no evidence that while accumulating the debts he took steps to \nmanage his obligations. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application.  On July 31, 2008, \nhe entered into credit counseling and a debt consolidation plan to manage his debts. \nTo-date there is no \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol,\u201d which is necessary to warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(c). However, \nexecuting the agreement is some evidence that he is making a good faith effort to \nresolve the debts, triggering a limited application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) or AG \u00b6 \n20(f). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out \nin AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b that Applicant falsified answers \nto two questions on his SF 86: In response to Section 28. Your Financial Record, he \nfailed to disclose all of the debts listed in the SOR; and, in response to Section 23. Your \nPolice Record, he failed to disclose a 1980 DUI. The Government contended that those \nomissions may raise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally omitted information about his delinquent debts \nand the old DUI. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant knew that he had some debts, but did not realize the scope of those \ndelinquencies or the length of time they had been outstanding. The first time he ever \nreviewed his credit report was in September 2007, after he completed the SF 86. He did \nnot disclose the DUI on the advice of two people at his office. Given his truthful and \ndetailed disclosure of one delinquent debt and a garnishment, and his discussion with \nsomeone from the human resources department, I find these explanations plausible. \nThe omission of the information was negligent and not intentional. Hence, the evidence \ndoes not establish deliberate falsification. This Guideline is found in his favor. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 56-year-old man, who \nhas a six-year successful work history with his current employer. He began \nexperiencing financial difficulties in 1999 when he married his second wife. In 2001, he \nwas unemployed for four months and in August 2003 he agreed, without legal counsel, \nto assume many of his wife\u2019s debts in their divorce settlement. Prior to that marriage, \nthere is no evidence of delinquent debts.  Subsequent to the divorce, he managed to \npay an outstanding judgment and became current with unpaid taxes. \n  \nIn October 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and notified the \nGovernment of his financial troubles. In September 2007, the Government sought \nspecific information about 32 delinquent debts that accrued from 2002 through 2007. He \nnever responded to that inquiry until the SOR was filed in April 2008, after which he \ndenied many of the debts. Four months later, at the hearing, he had not resolved one of \nthose debts, even those for small amounts. A week before the hearing, he contacted a \ndebt consolidation and counseling company. Immediately after the hearing he executed \nan agreement with company to begin investigating his debts and credit problems. His \nlack of timely attention to the Government\u2019s security concerns demonstrates poor \njudgment and leads me to believe that similar financial problems will recur, until he \naddresses the 29 debts and establishes a track record of managing his obligations. \nWhile employing a company to assist him in addressing his debts is an affirmative step \nof fiscal responsibility, he waited two years to take that step.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  Against Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.n that Applicant was delinquent on 14 debts totaling $40,121.99. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 12, 2007, admitted all of the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. Aside from a four-month lay-off in 2005, he has been 3 employed as a security guard by a defense contractor since May 2003. He has been steadily employed in a variety of jobs since at least August 1987. (Gx. 1) Applicant has been married twice. His first marriage started in October 1992 and ended in divorce in March 1997. He and his current wife were married in May 1998. They have two children, ages 9 and 6. Applicant attributes most of his financial problems to his current wife\u2019s failure to properly attend to the family finances. He testified she suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of their younger child in 2001. This caused her to completely disregard their bills and other financial obligations. (Tr. 39 - 40) He further testified that, in February 2003, his wife refinanced their mobile home by forging his signature on the loan documents. Because he disagreed with the decision to extend the period of the loan from 15 years to 30 years, he allowed the trailer to be repossessed and now owes approximately $23,136 on the balance after resale.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn October 1, 2003, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance for his employment\nwith a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On October 28, 2007, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nApril 7, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n This may account for the delay in completing the investigation / adjudication of his application for clearance.\n3\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to an administrative judge on December 10, 2007. On December 17, 2007,\nthe case was re-assigned to me, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on January 24,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx.\n1 - 4). Applicant testified in his own behalf and submitted two exhibits (Ax. A and B).\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 1, 2008. \nProcedural Issues\nApplicant did not receive DOHA\u2019s Notice of Hearing, which is dated January 9,\n2008, until January 14, 2008, less than 15 days before the hearing date. At the hearing,\nhe waived the right to 15 days of advance notice provided by Section E3.1.8 of\nEnclosure 3 to the Directive. (Tr. 5 - 8) \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.n that Applicant was delinquent on 14\ndebts totaling $40,121.99. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 12, 2007,\nadmitted all of the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. After a thorough review of\nthe pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 38 years old. Aside from a four-month lay-off in 2005,  he has been\n3\nemployed as a security guard by a defense contractor since May 2003. He has been\nsteadily employed in a variety of jobs since at least August 1987. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage started in October 1992 and\nended in divorce in March 1997. He and his current wife were married in May 1998.\nThey have two children, ages 9 and 6.\nApplicant attributes most of his financial problems to his current wife\u2019s failure to\nproperly attend to the family finances. He testified she suffered from postpartum\ndepression after the birth of their younger child in 2001. This caused her to completely\ndisregard their bills and other financial obligations. (Tr. 39 - 40) He further testified that,\nin February 2003, his wife refinanced their mobile home by forging his signature on the\nloan documents. Because he disagreed with the decision to extend the period of the\nloan from 15 years to 30 years, he allowed the trailer to be repossessed and now owes\napproximately $23,136 on the balance after resale. (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 40 - 46, 84; Gx. 3;\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nGx. 4) Applicant also blames his wife\u2019s postpartum depression for the repossession of\ntheir car in December 2003. He still owes approximately $5,867 after the resale of that\ncar. (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gx. 1; Tr. 47 - 48)\nApplicant has had two vehicles repossessed and his pay has been garnished to\nrepay delinquent debts. (Gx. 1) In 2003, he discovered $500 in his bank account to\nwhich he knew he was not entitled, as the bank had made an error in his favor.\nNonetheless, he withdrew the money (Tr. 51 - 53) and the bank has obtained a civil\njudgment against him for $525. This is one of at least five judgments totaling\napproximately $4,756 against him for delinquent debts (SOR 1.c - 1.g; Gx. 2 - 4). \nApplicant also owes approximately $6,270 for six other accounts that are past\ndue and / or placed for collection. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j - 1.n) The debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.I is\na duplicate of the debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.j. Three of the debts he owes are for less than\n$100 each and have been unpaid for up to 10 years. He has not paid or otherwise\nresolved any of the debts listed in the SOR. \nDuring his background investigation, Applicant was interviewed in November\n2006 by a government investigator, who suggested Applicant take action to resolve his\npast due debts. (Tr. 80 - 81) In 2003, Applicant consulted a bankruptcy attorney about\nfiling for Chapter 7 liquidation of his debts, but he never followed through. Applicant\nblamed his failure to file on the attorney\u2019s lack of attention to his case, but averred he\nwill file a Chapter 7 petition soon. (Tr. 79, 81, 97)\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors at work are pleased with his performance there. They\nconsider him to be an asset to their company and do not feel he is a security risk.\nHowever, the letters they submitted in support of his request for a clearance do not\nexpress any knowledge of the factual matters at issue in his case. (Ax. B and C)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.h and 1.j - 1.n that Applicant owes in excess of $40,000 in delinquent\n\n5\ndebts. The record further supports a conclusion his debts resulted from and are\nperpetuated by his deliberate neglect of his finances dating as far back as 1998, and\nthat he has taken no action to pay even the smallest of his debts. The record also\nreflects one instance of financial (and possibly criminal) misconduct stemming from his\nwithdrawal of funds from his account to which he knew he was not entitled. The facts\nestablished by the government\u2019s exhibits and Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony\nrequire application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), at AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and at AG \u00b6 19(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account\nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust). \nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant has attempted to place\nthe blame for his financial problems on his wife\u2019s postpartum depression. However, he\nprovided no information documenting her condition nor did he indicate how long her\ncondition lasted. His assertion that depression following the birth of their youngest child\nin 2001 affected her ability or willingness to pay bills does not explain her decision in\n2003 to refinance their home to reduce their monthly payment. Indeed, his claim that his\nwife forged his signature on the refinancing documents is itself not plausible. If that were\nthe case, the lender would have been easily persuaded to void the deal rather than be a\nparty to a fraudulent transaction.\nEven assuming his wife\u2019s decisions contributed to their debt problems, Applicant\nhas completely abdicated his responsibility in these matters. It is not unusual for a\nperson to rely on their spouse to pay the bills and manage the household finances.\nHowever, when a problem arises and is brought to the other partner\u2019s attention, he\nshould not be allowed to escape responsibility by using their arrangement as an excuse.\nApplicant has known about the debts in question for several years yet has done nothing\nto resolve them. Indeed, he has failed to pay even those debts less than $100, some of\nwhich were incurred around the time his first marriage ended and which he has been\nable to pay all along. \nApplicant provided no credible information on which to base application of any of\nthe mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20. Accordingly, he has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 38 years old and\nhas been gainfully employed for most of his adult life. His work record is satisfactory\nand, aside from his finances, there is no adverse information about other facets of his\nlife. However, available information suggests he has been willfully irresponsible when it\ncomes to his finances. Nor has he presented any information that would satisfy the\ngovernment that his financial matters will be resolved anytime soon and that he will not\ncontinue to ignore his responsibilities in this regard. \n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n6\nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s finances present an unacceptable\nrisk to the national interest were he to be granted access to classified information. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s\n8\nfinances shows there are still doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\nnational interest.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:  \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j - 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on August 3, 2005. On \nFebruary 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H, E, and J. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 13, 2008; answered it in \npart on February 28, 2008; completed his answer on April 22, 2008; and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the completed answer and \nrequest for a hearing on April 24, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nMay 12, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on May 14, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on May 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 16, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 12 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. The record \nclosed on June 16, 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 27, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of drug abuse in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old technical support engineer employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2005. He is married \nand has a son. He received an interim clearance in October 2003, and he has held a \nfinal clearance since December 2004 (Tr. 16).  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana about 10 times from 1996 or 1997 through 2000, used \necstasy once in 2001, and used illegal anabolic and androgenic steroids from March \n2002 to May 2006. Applicant and his friends usually purchased steroids in sufficient \nquantities to share them, and they would routinely exchange drugs when one of them \nran out of a particular drug (GX 5 at 2).  \n \nIn June 2002, Applicant and two friends purchased steroids from a pharmacy in \nMexico where they could be sold legally without a prescription. Applicant carried some \nof the steroids into the U.S. in his luggage (GX 5 at 2; Tr. 67). He purchased steroids \nover the internet about six times, and he had them sent to a post office box instead of \nhis home to avoid detection (Tr. 66-67).  \n \nApplicant began using steroids to improve his overall health, but he continued to \nuse them against the advice of his personal physician, knowing his steroid use was \nillegal (GX 5 at 1). He consulted with his physician in 2006 about chronic fatigue and \nwas advised that his fatigue may have been caused by his prior steroid use (Tr. 65). He \ninjected himself with steroids one time in May 2006, found that it did not ameliorate his \nfatigue, and has not used them again because of concerns about his health (Tr. 66). He \nno longer has any contact with his fellow steroid users (Tr. 55-56). \n \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) \n(GX 3). He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27, asking if he had used any controlled \nsubstance since the age of 16 or during the last seven years. He did not disclose his \nuse of marijuana, illegal steroids, or ecstasy.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Security Clearance \nProcessing (e-QIP) in August 2005 seeking eligibility for access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI). In response to question 24 about using controlled \nsubstances during the last seven years, he disclosed using of illegal steroids about 10 \ntimes, but he did not disclose any use of marijuana or ecstasy.  \n \n \nA security investigator interviewed Applicant in September 2005. During this \ninterview, Applicant admitted using marijuana about ten times between 1996 or 1997 \nand 2000, and using steroids from 2002 to mid-2004. He described the cyclic pattern of \nhis steroid use, ingesting increasing quantities over a period of four to six weeks, \nfollowed by decreasing use and then abstinence for one or two months. He admitted \npurchasing steroids over the internet on about six occasions. He told the investigator he \nhad stopped using steroids but still possessed some of them because he was fearful of \nplacing them in his personal trash (GX 9 at 1-2; GX 11).  \n \n \nAnother security investigator interviewed Applicant in February 2006. During this \ninterview he admitted using marijuana about ten times between the ages of 17 and 20. \nHe also purchasing steroids over the internet and using steroids about ten times during \na two-year period. He told the investigator he stopped using steroids in August 2004 \n(GX 6; Tr. 31-32). \n \n \nAn investigator interviewed Applicant in June 2006. During this interview \nApplicant admitted using marijuana about ten times between 1996/1997 and 2000 and \nusing steroids between 2002 and November 2004. He told the investigator he threw his \nremaining steroids into the trash in March 2005. He denied purchasing drugs over the \ninternet. He denied using steroids after November 2004. He also denied ever using \necstasy (GX 5; Tr. 39-43). \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed again by an investigator in September 2006. The \ninvestigator\u2019s summary of this interview reflects that he told the investigator he still \npossessed a quantity of steroids, that he sold $160 worth of steroids to a friend, and \nthat he used steroids once in May 2006, and he consumed one-half of an ecstasy pill in \n2001 (GX 9 at 2-3; GX 12). \n \n \nApplicant was denied eligibility for access to SCI in October 2006 (GX 9). The \ndecision recited findings that he used marijuana between 1996/1997 and 2000, used \necstasy on one occasion in 2001, used steroids from 2002 to July 2004 and again in \nMay 2006, and sold steroids to a friend for $160 in August 2006. He appealed, but the \ndecision to deny eligibility was upheld in January 2007 (GX 8). \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in June 2007, Applicant disclosed \nhis marijuana use and his use of steroids. He told the investigator he obtained the \nsteroids from his friends, who purchased them over the internet. He denied purchasing \nsteroids directly over the internet, and he denied ever selling them. He admitted giving \nsteroids worth about $160 to a friend (GX 5 at 1-2). He stated he threw his remaining \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsteroids into a dumpster in March 2005 (GX 2). He denied using ecstasy at any time \n(GX 5 at 3). \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he did not remember denying direct \npurchases of steroids over the internet. He denied selling steroids, denied possessing \nand using steroids in 2006, and admitted using ecstasy on one occasion in 2001. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted his marijuana and steroid use. He admitted \nusing steroids once in May 2006 (Tr. 56). He testified he failed to disclose this use of \nsteroids in his June 2007 security interview because he had forgotten about it (Tr. 60, \n62). He admitted purchasing steroids over the internet, and he also admitted one over-\nthe-counter purchase of steroids in Mexico (Tr. 54). He denied selling steroids, but \nadmitted giving steroids worth $160 to a friend (Tr. 54). He recanted his earlier \nadmissions to using ecstasy, stating that on one occasion he pretended to consume \npart of an ecstasy pill given to him by a friend but \u201ctossed it aside\u201d instead of consuming \nit (Tr. 57, 75).  \n \nApplicant denied falsifying his various security clearance applications or \nintentionally misleading security investigators (Tr. 51-54, 59-63), but he admitted he did \nnot tell the \u201cfull truth\u201d when he told an investigator he disposed of all his steroids in \nMarch 2005 (Tr. 68). He testified he disclosed ten instances of steroid use on his e-QIP \nin August 2003 because that was his best estimate of his instances of steroid use; but \nhe admitted he went through about four cycles of use, with each cycle running four to \nsix weeks, during which he used steroids at least once a week (Tr. 72-73). \n \n \nApplicant submitted a written statement of intent to refrain from further illegal \ndrug use, offered to undergo a polygraph to verify his testimony at the hearing, and \nagreed to automatic revocation of his clearance for any further violations (AX A at 5). \nApplicant informed his supervisor of his history of drug use before the hearing (Tr. 73). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana from 1996/1997 through 2000 (\u00b6 \n1.a), used ecstasy in \u201cat least\u201d 2001 (\u00b6 1.b), used illegal anabolic and androgenic \nsteroids from \u201cat least\u201d March 2002 to late 2004 and in 2006 (\u00b6 1.d), purchased illegal \nanabolic and androgenic steroids (\u00b6 1.d), sold an illegal anabolic steroid to a friend in \nAugust 2006 for about $160 (\u00b6 1.e), gave an illegal anabolic steroid to a friend in about \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2002 (\u00b6 1.f), and used illegal anabolic and androgenic steroids while holding an interim \nsecurity clearance (\u00b6 1.g). \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline H is set out in AG & 24 as follows: \nAUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.@ Substances encompassed by this guideline include \u201cdrugs, \nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, \nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use \nof a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical \ndirection.@ AG \u00b6 24(b).  \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse,@ and \nAillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.@ AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c).  Applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana, ecstasy, and steroids raises these two disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise these disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first clause of AG \n\u00b6 26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recency of drug involvement. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use ended eight years ago, and his one-time use of \necstasy was about seven years ago. His regular use of steroids ended in November \n2004, with one additional use in March 2006, and he stopped using steroids because of \nconcerns about his health. His previous drug use is not likely to recur. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n26(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4). Applicant no longer associates with his friends with whom he used \nsteroids. He has abstained from steroid use for a significant period of time, and he \nsubmitted a signed statement of intent. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because Applicant has not received any drug treatment. He has, however, \nreceived advice against further steroid use from his personal physician and apparently \nhas heeded it. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his SF 86 in October 2003 by deliberately \nfailing to disclose his use of marijuana, ecstasy, and steroids (\u00b6 2.a); falsified his e-QIP \nin August 2005 by deliberately failing to disclose his use of marijuana and ecstasy (\u00b6 \n2.b), and deliberately failing to fully disclose the extent of his steroid use (\u00b6 2.c). It also \nalleges he falsified material facts during a security investigator in June 2007 by failing to \ndisclose his purchases of steroids through the internet (\u00b6 2.d), and failing to disclose his \nsale of steroids to a friend in August 2006 (\u00b6 2.e). It further alleges he falsely stated he \nthrew his remaining illegal steroids in the garbage in March 2005 (\u00b6 2.g), and falsely \ndenied using ecstasy in 2002 (\u00b6 2.f). Finally, it alleges he used illegal steroids while \nholding a security clearance (\u00b6 2,g). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline can be raised by \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). A disqualifying condition also can be raised by \n\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official \ngovernment representative.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not \nprove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge \nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the \nomission or misstatement. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant testified his failure to disclose his use of marijuana, ecstasy, and \nsteroids on his SF 86 in October 2003 and his failure to disclose his use of marijuana \nand ecstasy on his e-QIP in August 2005 were not intentional omissions, but he gave \nno plausible explanation for the omissions. He is well-educated, intelligent, and \narticulate, and he gave no indication he misunderstood the questions. I conclude the \ngovernment has presented substantial evidence to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a and 2.b. \n \n \nApplicant testified his disclosure in his e-QIP of using steroids ten times was an \nestimate. He admitted going through about four cycles of steroid use, each cycle lasting \nfour to six weeks, and he admitted taking steroids at least once a week during each \ncycle. Based on his own testimony, he probably used steroids at least 16 times. I \nconclude his disclosure on his e-QIP was another instance in his pattern of understating \nhis drug involvement. I conclude the government has presented substantial evidence to \nsupport the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c. Based on the evidence supporting SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, \nand 2.c, I conclude the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nThe allegations of falsification in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.h all arise from \nApplicant\u2019s interview by a security investigator in June 2007. In that interview, he denied \npurchasing steroids over the internet (\u00b6 2.d), selling steroids (\u00b6 2.e), and using ecstasy \n(\u00b6 2.h). He stated he last used steroids in November 2004 and threw the remaining \nsteroids in the trash in March 2005; and he failed to disclose his possession and use of \nsteroids in May 2006 (\u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g).  \n \n \nThe investigator\u2019s summary of an interview of Applicant in September 2005 (GX \n11) reflects that Applicant admitted purchasing steroids over the internet and still having \nsome in his possession. This interview summary does not mention selling steroids or \nusing ecstasy. An investigator\u2019s summary of another interview in September 2006 (GX \n12) reflects that Applicant admitted selling steroids, and consuming one-half of an \necstasy pill. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he did not recall denying that he \npurchased steroids directly on the internet. He denied selling steroids, denied using and \npossessing steroids in 2006, and admitted using ecstasy in 2001. At the hearing, he \nadmitted purchasing steroids directly on the internet, possessing steroids in 2006, and \nusing them. He denied selling steroids. He testified he only pretended to consume one-\nhalf of an ecstasy pill, an explanation he had not previously tendered.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nBased on all the evidence, including my observations of Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nduring the hearing, I conclude that in his June 2007 interview he intentionally and \nfalsely denied purchasing steroids over the internet, falsely denied using ecstasy, and \nfalsely stated he last used steroids in November 2004 and threw away his remaining \nsteroids in March 2005.  \n \n \nI also conclude that the investigator\u2019s summary of the September 2006 interview, \nreflecting an admission of selling steroids is probably inaccurate. It is inconsistent with \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of use, in which he and his friends shared their drugs, and is \ninconsistent with all the other evidence in the record.  \n \n \nI conclude there is substantial evidence to support all the allegations in under \nGuideline E except SOR \u00b6 2.e. I further conclude the evidence is sufficient to raise the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(b). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.i cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s use of illegal steroids while holding a \nclearance, also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g under Guideline H. A disqualifying condition under \nGuideline E can be raised by \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(c).  \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201ccredible adverse information that is \nnot explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d). This disqualifying condition encompasses \u201cuntrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior\u201d and \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1) and \n(3).  \n \n \nOn its face, AG \u00b6 16(d) appears to cover only information \u201cthat is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline.\u201d The Appeal Board, however, has construed AG \u00b6 \n16(d) more broadly, holding: \u201c(1) it continues the longstanding tenet that specific \nbehavior can have security significance under more than one guideline and (2) by \nfocusing on the concepts of questionable judgment and irresponsibility, it contemplates \nthat behavior will have independent security significance under Guideline E in a broad \nrange of cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008), 2008 WL 2002589 \nat *4.   \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cpersonal conduct, or \nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person\u2019s personal professional, or community standing, or (2) while in \nanother country, engaging in activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that \ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or \npressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e). \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cassociation with persons involved in \ncriminal activity.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(g).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal steroids while holding a clearance, while his application \nfor SCI eligibility was pending, and after being interviewed by his illegal drug use by a \nsecurity investigator in September 2005 demonstrates questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nIt also made him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress to protect his \nprofessional standing. His transportation of illegal steroids into the U.S. made him \nvulnerable to exploitation or pressure. His conduct raises AG \u00b6 16(c), (d), and (e). His \nassociation with two friends who purchased and used illegal steroids raises AG \u00b6 16(g). \nThus, the burden is on Applicant to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted \nwith the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant had an opportunity to correct the omissions from \nhis October 2003 application when he submitted another security clearance application \nin August 2005, but he did not do so. He did not fully disclose his drug abuse when \ninterviewed by security investigators in September 2005, February 2006, and June \n2006. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications were felonies, as discussed below under Guideline J. His \nmisconduct was not infrequent, nor did it occur under unique circumstances. His latest \nfalsifications were recent, occurring during a security interview in June 2007. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant acknowledged his drug abuse at the \nhearing, but he acknowledged only some of his falsifications, and he maintained he did \nnot deliberately falsify his security clearance applications. He apparently has stopped \n\n \n11 \n \n \nusing illegal steroids because of health concerns, but continues to have problems with \ncandor. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual has taken \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant has stopped using illegal drugs, and his employer is now \naware that his SCI application was denied because of his drug use. I conclude this \nmitigating condition is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). \nApplicant has stopped associating with the two friends involved in illegal purchases and \nuse of steroids. I conclude this mitigating condition is established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s falsifications alleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.h \nwere felonies in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The concern raised by criminal conduct is \nthat it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. Deliberately false answers on a security clearance application and false \nanswers to a security investigator are serious crimes within the meaning of Guideline J. \nApplicant\u2019s false answers on his SF 86 and e-QIP, and his false statements to a security \ninvestigator concerning material facts raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) \nand (c), shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s most recent falsifications occurred in \nJune 2007, in connection with his current application for a clearance. They did not occur \nunder unusual conditions, and they raise doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by \u201cevidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). This \nmitigating condition is not established because the falsifications occurred as recently as \nJune 2007, and Applicant persisted in his lack of candor at the hearing by recanting his \nmultiple admissions to using ecstasy.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred when he was young and immature. He \nstopped using marijuana in 2000, and he used ecstasy only once in 2001. He used \nillegal steroids to improve his physical fitness, and he eventually stopped when he \nrealized that they endangered his health. I conclude he has mitigated the security \nconcerns under Guideline H. However, he has not mitigated the security concerns \nbased on personal conduct and criminal conduct. He used illegal steroids while holding \na clearance, and he repeatedly and deliberately omitted material facts on his two \nsecurity clearance applications and in multiple interviews by security investigators. His \nbreach of trust by using illegal drugs while holding a clearance, and his lack of candor \nduring the current security clearance process raise grave doubts about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, E, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement, personal \nconduct, and criminal conduct.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Jason Thomas, PhD, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn April 21, 2004, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On August 18, 2004, she re-signed it. On September 25, 2007, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline C for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 31, 2007. She answered \nthe SOR in writing on November 9, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 15, 2007. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on November 29, 2007, and I received the case \nassignment on December 3, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 20, \n2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 23, 2008. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C into the record without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 1, 2008. The \nrecord remained open until February 14, 2008, to give Applicant additional time to \nsubmit documents.  She timely submitted five exhibits that I marked as AE D through I \nand admitted into evidence without objection.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nAfter Applicant testified, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by \nadding \u00b61.g, alleging Applicant maintains an Israeli identification card. (Tr. at 46.) \nApplicant did not object to the motion. Said motion was granted.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Israel. (Tr. 11). The request and the attached documents were \nincluded in the record as Administrative Exhibits (AE) I through VIII. Applicant did not \nobject to my consideration of those exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated November 9, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f and 1.g of the Amended SOR, with \nexplanations. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.e of the SOR. She also provided \nadditional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and was born in the United States. She graduated from \na U.S. university in 1994.  She earned her last semester of undergraduate college in \nIsrael in 1993. After completing that semester, she traveled around Europe for a \nsemester before going home. (Tr. 20). In June 1996, she returned to Israel to attend \ngraduate school. In November 1999, she earned a Master\u2019s Degree in Israeli Politics, \nwith a focus on counter-terrorism. She chose to attend the Israeli university because of \nits renowned faculty and reduced tuition. After graduating, she came home for a couple \nmonths and then moved back to Israel to live and work, while pursuing a romantic \ninterest with an Israeli man. (Tr. 22). For the next two years she worked for a \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncommunications company. (Tr. 24).  She returned home in April 2002 where her family \nlives. Recently, she became engaged to an American citizen. \n \n \nBased on her Jewish background, Applicant obtained Israeli citizenship in July \n2000. As a result of that citizenship, she received some tax advantages related to salary \nand health benefits. (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 32 and 37). In February 2001, she voted in the prime \nminister election, basing her candidate decision on the United States\u2019 interest. (Tr. 33 \nand 36). That was the only time she voted in an Israeli election. (Id.). She never \nobtained an Israeli passport, but traveled with her U.S. passport.  (Tr. 31). She still has \nan Israeli identification card that she used to travel within the state because she thinks \nshe may need it to renounce her citizenship. (Tr. 39).  (At the hearing, she offered to \ntender the document for destruction.) (Tr. 45). The only property she held in Israel was \na checking account for purposes of convenience.  (GE 2). \n \n \nAfter working for the wireless communications company for a year, Applicant \nbegan searching for another job in September 2001. She saw a newspaper ad by an \nunnamed company that piqued her interest because it advertised for analysts, a position \nmore suited to her background. (Tr. 25).  She and some of her friends thought the \ncompany might represent the Israeli Intelligence Service (Mossad).  She decided to \nsubmit a resume. Four months later, she received a call in response to her application \nand made an appointment for an interview.  The caller did not disclose the name of the \ncompany.  In the interim, her relationship with her boyfriend was not working out. After \ngiving that situation more thought and considering the possibility that the potential job, if \nMossad, could jeopardize her future and work at home, she decided to return home. \nShe called the company and cancelled the appointment. (Tr. 27 and 34; GE 2 and 3; \nAnswer). In April 2002, she returned home. (Tr. 23).  She never intended to live in Israel \npermanently. (Tr. 38). She has not visited Israel since then and has no plans to return. \nShe maintains limited contact with four friends living in Israel, three of whom are U.S. \ncitizens. (Answer). \n \n \nSince April 2004, Applicant has worked as a research analyst for a federal \ncontract that provides assistance to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. (Tr. 30).  She \nworks on projects involving terrorism and natural disaster responses by the federal \ngovernment. (Tr. 31).  She speaks a foreign language fluently and has done extensive \nwork and research in the area of terrorist organizations, as noted in her extensive  \nMaster\u2019s thesis on counter-terrorism. (AE A).  \n  \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation from colleagues in support of \nher security clearance application. One individual, a Director for a program with the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, has worked with her over a year. He wrote that \nApplicant \u201cdemonstrated strong traits of leadership during this process and also \nmaintained a high degree of loyalty toward the best interests of the U.S. Government.\u201d \n(AE E).  Another colleague at that office, a retired Air Force member with 24 years of \nactive duty service who held a Top Secret security clearance during his career, refers to \nApplicant as trustworthy and \u201ca loyal U.S. citizen [who is] extremely passionate about \nher projects that support US homeland security.\u201d (AE F).  He perceives no security \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthreats by her. (Id.). The president of a research institute, her current employer for the \npast three and a half years, noted in his letter that Applicant has been given principal \nroles in projects involving national planning and preparation for terrorist attack or natural \ndisasters \u201cbecause of her demonstrated ability, integrity, and interest in helping secure \nthe nation\u2019s homeland.\u201d (AE G). A vice-president of that organization mirrored the \npresident\u2019s recommendation and confidence in her loyalty. He has \u201cno qualms \nwhatsoever in recommending [Applicant] for a Secret clearance.\u201d (AE H).  \n \nThroughout the investigation and during the hearing, Applicant indicated that she \nwould willingly formally renounce her Israeli citizenship. (Answer; Tr. 32 and 53). In her \nMay 2005 Affidavit she stated, \u201cIf asked by the United States Government or a \nperspective employer, I am willing to denounce my Israeli citizenship.\u201d (AE 3). In March \n2007, she affirmed in her affidavit \u201cI am willing to relinquish my Israeli citizenship if \nasked. I have never been asked to do so by anyone and as such have never taken any \nsteps to relinquish my Israeli citizenship.\u201c (AE 2 at 2). Her November 2007 Answer \nreiterated her willingness to renounce the Israeli citizenship. \u201cI told each interviewer that \nif my clearance was contingent on surrendering my Israeli citizenship, then I would \ngladly do so. However, I was told that citizenship itself is not the problem and that \nusually the issue is having dual passports.\u201d At the hearing, she stated it was her \nintention to renounce her citizenship. (Tr. 49). On February 5, 2008, she flew to another \ncity to file her renouncement papers with the Israel Consulate General. (AE H and I). \nShe was informed that the process could take a year to complete. (AE D).  \n \n \nApplicant stated that her decision to travel to Israel was based on her \ndesire to help the United States in its fight on counter-terrorism in the Middle East.  \n\u201cThis is why I went to Israel to study, this is why. I was interested in counter-terrorism. \nIt\u2019s all because I want to perform a service for the United States, and I think at every \nturn I tried to do what you\u2019re supposed to do to get that done.\u201d (Tr. 58).   \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Israel is a stable parliamentary \ndemocracy whose prime minister heads the government and exercises executive \npower. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy that is growing at \nabout 5.2% per year, and the United States is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. Almost \nhalf of Israel\u2019s exports are high tech and its major industrial sectors include high-\ntechnology electric and bio-medical equipment. The Israeli government generally \nrespects the human rights of its citizens and does not support or sponsor terrorism or \nterrorist organizations. It is a strong U.S. ally in fighting terrorism. Commitment to \nIsrael\u2019s security and well being has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East \nsince Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, and the two countries are bound closely by historic and \ncultural ties, as well as mutual values and interests.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n5 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern, two of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case and are noted below: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial, or business \ninterests in another country; \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and, \n(7) voting in a foreign election; and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nApplicant was born in the United States. From approximately 1996 until 2002, \nshe lived and attended school in Israel. While there, she became a citizen, in order to \nreceive educational, medical and economic benefits. She voted in one election and \nobtained citizenship identification. Based on that evidence in the record, including \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to six of the SOR allegations, the Government produced \nsubstantial evidence of disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) and 10(a)(7), and  \n\u00b610 (b). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those conditions, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 \n\n \n7 \n \n \n11 provides eleven conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Only one of the \nconditions is potentially applicable to the disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 11(b) applies \nwhen \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d \nApplicant expressed her willingness to renounce her Israeli citizenship after \ncompleting the security clearance application and learning that it could adversely affect \nher application. She repeated that willingness in May 2005, March 2007, November \n2007, and during the hearing in January 2008. Shortly after the hearing, she flew to \nanother state to begin the renunciation process. Prior to that time, she did not fully \nappreciate the significance of formally renouncing her citizenship rather than informally \nvolunteering to do so.  She understood that it was important to surrender a passport, if \nshe possessed one, but not the importance of formally renouncing citizenship for this \napplication.  \nIn addition to taking formal steps to renounce citizenship, Applicant has \ndemonstrated her loyalty to the United States, based on many strong connections to it, \nintention to live here permanently, and a persistent desire to use her background and \ntraining to assist in the war on terror. As a result of her consistent willingness to \nrenounce the Israeli citizenship and her longstanding ties to the United States, I \nconclude AG \u00b6 11(b) applies.   \nIn support of its application, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s opinion in ISCR Case No. \n03-4300 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006) that held the following: \nIn concluding Applicant had mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her acts of foreign preference by application of Guideline C Mitigating \nCondition 4, the Administrative Judge articulated a rational explanation for \nher determination\u2014basing it on such factors as the Applicants\u2019 strong ties \nand loyalties to the United States, the extensive effort undertaken by the \nApplicant to surrender her passport and renounce her Russian citizenship \nbefore the close of the record, and the fact that Applicant\u2019s lack of \nawareness concerning the requirements expressed in the ASDC3I memo \nand the Guideline C Mitigating Conditions may have affected the timing of \nher renunciation actions. There are no stated requirements in Guideline C \nMitigating Condition 4 concerning when an applicant is required to comply \nwith its provisions.1  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n                                                          \n1 Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 4 under the previous adjudicative Guideline C, stated as \nfollows: \u201cIndividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d E2.A3.1.3.4. The ASDC31 \nmemo referenced does not have applicability to this case and pertained to the surrender of foreign \npassports. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential \nconcern under Guideline C resulted from choices made by her while in graduate school \nand during a previous romantic relationship. She was 24 years old when she decided to \nmove to Israel and 30 years old when she returned home.  For the past five years she \nhas lived and worked in the United States her home country. One of the reasons she \nchose to attend school in Israel was its reputation and faculty that is world renowned for \nits expertise in counter-terrorism, her chosen area of study.  Her decision to obtain \nIsraeli citizenship related to economic, educational and medical benefits afforded to her \nas a student and young person living there. She voted in one Israeli election and had \nthe U.S. interests in mind.  While her inquiry into employment with a company that \n\u201ccould have been\u201d the Mossad, may not have been prudent, given her goal to secure \nemployment in the field of counter-terrorism and the United States, she cancelled her \ninterview and returned to the United States before taking additional steps in that regard. \nRecently, she formally renounced her Israeli citizenship by filing appropriate documents \nwith the Israeli embassy. Currently, four colleagues and supervisors, who have worked \nwith her since she returned return, support her assertions of commitment to her job and \npreference for the United States.  I do not believe she is a threat to the United States, \nbut rather an honest, hard-working woman, who possibly made uninformed decisions \nearly in her career, which she will never repeat.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nregarding personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SOR issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn November 19, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR allegations by\nconstructively denying all substantive allegations raised. The case was assigned to an\nadministrative judge on January 7, 2008. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to\na February 28, 2008, hearing date and a Notice of Hearing was issued on January 22,\n2008. Due to caseload considerations, the case was reassigned to me on February 26,\n2008. \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n Tr. 30.\n    1\n Tr. 68; 75 (W hen asked whether she was unhappy about her imminent promotion, Applicant stated: \u201cNo\n    2\nI was not.

Department Counsel submitted three\nexhibits (Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-3 without objection. Applicant testified\nand submitted 10 exhibits, which were accepted as Exs. A-J without objection. One\nwitness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 7, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old information coordinator who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since January 2004. Retiring from the U.S. military after 20 years of\nservice in 1999, Applicant soon found civilian employment with the military, working in\nthe area of intelligence. She remained with the military until the end of 2003. Currently\nsingle, she has two grown daughters and an infant grandchild.\nWhen Applicant first started civilian government work at the end of 1999, she\nwas hired as a computer specialist. She was then moved to the Freedom of Information\nAct/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) Office, where she served as an intelligence specialist\nprocessing status up-dates on security clearances and working with non-complex\nFOIA/PA cases.  She did not check on current security clearance statuses, but passed\n1\non requests of that nature to her superior. In July 2002, she was promoted to\nintelligence assistant, processing completed intelligence products. Before leaving for\nher new job, Applicant checked the progress on her security clearance with a contact in\na military central clearance facility (CCF) so she would know of its status when she\nstarted pursuing private sector employment.  A more lucrative job offer from the private\n2\nsector would be orally extended to Applicant sometime in the latter part of November\n2003, at which time Applicant would orally apprise her superiors that she would be\ntaking another position once the paperwork had been finished.\nIn the interim, during the autumn of 2003, the husband of a division chief from\nApplicant\u2019s workplace called the sister of a manager at Applicant\u2019s workplace. She\ncalled her brother to tell him that the man\u2019s wife \u201cwas mad that someone has spread a\nrumor that she had a daughter.\u201d  Rumors apparently also arose concerning the child\u2019s\n3\nparentage. Unbeknownst to Applicant, an informal investigation was initiated on\nNovember 24, 2003.  The appointed investigative officer was charged with investigating\n4\nan allegation that personal information had been improperly disclosed from military\nrecords. The alleged disclosure concerned the division chief. There is no mention of\nApplicant in the memorandum appointing the investigating officer. \n\n Case File, Military Investigative Records Repository File (Ex. 7, Statement of Dec. 4, 2003).\n    5\n Case File, Military Investigative Records Repository File (Ex. 8, Statement of Dec. 16, 2003).\n    6\n Id.\n    7\n Case File, Military Investigative Records Repository File (Ex. 7, Statement of Dec. 4, 2003); Case File,\n    8\nMilitary Investigative Records Repository File (Ex. 8, Statement of Dec. 16, 2003).\n Ex. H. (Employment Offer, dated Dec. 12, 2003).\n    9\n Ex. I (Resignation letter, dated Dec. 23, 2003); Ex. J (Notification of Personnel Action, effective January\n    10\n5, 2004, citing reason for departures as \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d).\n Some testimony stated the date as Dec. 16, 2003, but Ex. 1, supra, note 6, shows that Applicant signed\n    11\nher sworn statement on Dec. 12, 2003. Unbeknownst to Applicant, a leak of personal information regarding\nthe former division chief was the subject of the interview.\n3\nA December 4, 2003, interview of the division chief indicated that, based on what\nshe had been told by another co-worker, she suspected Applicant may have been the\nsource of the rumor.  That other co-worker later gave a statement directly citing\n5\nApplicant as the source of the rumor.  In that statement, the woman also detailed her\n6\npersonal observations of what she described as improper behavior by Applicant\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s contacting former colleagues to find out security clearance\nstatuses of current co-workers. She stated she observed such incidents dating back as\nfar as nine months, most of it never previously reported. Her depiction included\ninstances of her own gossiping with Applicant, including chat about the woman at issue\nin the investigation. She admitted that she had asked Applicant to help her find out the\nstatus of her own security clearance in August 2003.  She explained that she did so as\n7\npart of her covert efforts to discover who was giving Applicant information on employee\nsecurity clearance statuses, although she never explained why she failed to report her\nfindings until she was sought out for interview in December 2003.  Of all the\n8\ninvestigative interviews conducted, only the statement of the woman whose privacy was\nthe subject of the investigation and the statement of the woman who told her Applicant\nwas the source of the rumor suggest Applicant gossiped about the investigation\nsubject\u2019s marriage. \nWhile the informal investigation proceeded, Applicant received her job offer in\nwritten form by letter dated December 12, 2003. It confirmed the offer of a salary of\napproximately $79,000 and a competitive benefits package.  This was a large economic\n9\njump from her then-current salary of $47,000 per year. She was excited that, with her\nhigher salary, she could help her daughter finish school and, perhaps, return to school\nherself. She informed her superiors that the job offer had been received in writing and\nthat she planned to submit her written resignation on December 23, 2003, with a\nprojected date of departure on January 5, 2004.  She would start her new job the\n10\nfollowing week.\nAlso on December 12, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by the investigator\nconcerning several colleagues, including her former division chief.  Applicant\u2019s own\n11\n\n Tr. 72.\n    12\n Tr. 73.\n    13\n Ex.

Applicant was not told who the subject of the\ninvestigation was.  She was told the subject of the investigation could not be disclosed\n12\nat that time.  She made a written statement summarizing the interview.  With regard to\n13\n14\nthe division chief, Applicant stated she had a working relationship with her and had, in\nthe past, discussed such topics as being stationed abroad, the divorce rate of military\npeople stationed in Europe, and other topics in common to two former military females.\nOf the division chief\u2019s personal life, Applicant knew very little besides \u201cwater cooler talk\u201d\nabout the woman\u2019s marriage.  Neither woman likes the other, although the reasons\n15\nwhy are unclear.\nWith regard to a former first line supervisor in the FOIA/PA office, Applicant\nstated during the interview that she knew him professionally as a former boss. She\nstated that after leaving the FOIA/PA office, Applicant asked this former boss to check\non the security clearance status of the woman with whom she was currently in training\nand was meant to replace. Such information was available through the security\nclearances index database. She did so at the request of the woman, whose promotion\nseemed stalled.  Applicant was personally concerned because the woman continued to\n16\nhave login and password access which Applicant had yet not been extended, making\nher observational training under the woman of little effective value.  Applicant\u2019s former\n17\nboss confirmed that the woman\u2019s security clearance was pending and suggested there\nmay be financial issues. Applicant relayed the information to the woman, who\neventually moved to her new position.\nDuring the interview, Applicant was also asked about a peer for whom she was\nserving as his production assistant/manager. Applicant stated she knew nothing about\nthe man\u2019s personal life and had never asked for any information about him in the\nworkplace. Applicant was specifically asked whether she knew why a particular woman\nfrom the FOIA/PA office had her security clearance withdrawn or whether she had\nheard any gossip about the woman.  Applicant told the investigator she had never\n18\nchecked on the woman\u2019s security clearance status nor asked anyone to check it for her.\nShe did state, however, that she had heard someone in the office say the woman\n\u201cowed them money\u201d and that the woman had been charged with some form of drug\noffense.  \n19\n\n Tr. 57.\n    20\n Tr. 58.\n    21\n Id.\n    22\n Tr. 62-63; 101-102.\n    23\n Tr. 66.\n    24\n Tr. 71-72; 137-138.\n    25\n Tr. 99.\n    26\n Tr. 121-123.\n    27\n Tr. 62.\n    28\n Tr. 130.\n    29\n5\nThe investigator further asked Applicant about a new hire who was serving as\nApplicant\u2019s team lead. She and the team lead shared a small cubicle, sometimes using\neach other\u2019s work areas. After he arrived, it took a long time for his security clearance to\nbe approved. Applicant became concerned that her work, which was with strictly\nclassified material, was within his view and access.  The man told Applicant he shared\n20\nher concern and the matter was raised with Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor and\nsenior leadership. Applicant was told to \u201cmind your own business,\u201d  but she remained\n21\nconcerned. After two months, Applicant and the man \u201cwere so concerned about him not\nbeing cleared properly that I said well let me just check the status of his clearance. So I\ncalled [my female CCF contact].\u201d  In October 2003, she called the contact in the\n22\npresence of a senior research analyst who was also a good friend.  The man was not\n23\nat work at the time and Applicant did not have his social security number, so the contact\nnarrowed down people until the man\u2019s entry was ultimately discerned. The contact\nconfirmed that the man\u2019s clearance status was still pending. Applicant informed the\nman the following day. Subsequent to that time, Applicant introduced the senior analyst\nfriend to her contact at the CCF so the friend could check on her own security\nclearance.24\nAt no time was it suggested to her that her checking was improper, illegal, or a\nviolation of the Privacy Act.  Applicant maintains she never intended to access, request\n25\nto access, and/or request information be provided to her for which she did not have a\nneed to know.  There was nothing to preclude any of the people Applicant checked on\n26\nfrom personally checking on whether their clearances were pending.  Applicant\n27\nassumed it was not inappropriate, citing to her genuine concerns regarding the handling\nof classified materials by those without a clearance and stating that she relied on her\nformer boss and her contact to inform her if such requests were inappropriate.28\nApplicant saw no reason to follow formal channels of inquiry with regard to verifying\nthese individuals\u2019 security clearance status because she did not think there was\nanything wrong with doing it orally.  Those she called seemed to help her as a way to\n29\n\n Tr. 141.\n    30\n Tr. 131.\n    31\n Case File, Military Investigative Records Repository File  (Ex. 8, Statement of Dec. 16, 2003).\n    32\n U.S. Military Investigative Records Repository, Summary of Dec. 12, 2003, at 2.\n    33\n Id.\n    34\n Id.\n    35\n Id.\n    36\n Id.\n    37\n Tr. 150-151.\n    38\n6\nexpedite satisfying the request for information regarding employee security clearance,\nin lieu of going through a multi-step, formal written request and answer process.  \u201cI\n30\ndidn\u2019t think anything was wrong with it. And I\u2019m quite sure if it had been then [my\nsuperior] would have told me.\u201d  \n31\nThe informal investigation was to be issued no later than 14 calendar days of the\nNovember 24, 2003, letter appointing the investigating officer. The investigator\u2019s report\nwas late. It was dated December 12, 2003, the day of Applicant\u2019s interview. At least one\nof its referenced subject interviews, however, was dated December 16, 2003.  \n32\nThe investigator made three recommendations based on his conclusions.\nAmong those recommendations was administrative action against Applicant for\nperpetuating rumors about employees.  Applicant was described as a woman who\n33\nviolated the privacy rights of others by looking up personal clearance information \u201cand is\nan overall busy body in everyone\u2019s business.\u201d  It was recommended Applicant\u2019s\n34\nsecurity clearance be temporarily revoked and that she be put on unpaid leave.35\nAdministrative action was also urged to stop Applicant from her \u201cwell established\npattern of looking through individual\u2019s clearance records without permission or need to\nknow.\u201d  The investigator also concluded that Applicant violated individuals\u2019 rights to\n36\nprivacy, and had used her position and friendship to improperly collect information on\nfellow employees. The investigator did not note a rule or regulation prohibiting or\notherwise addressing such activity. Those helping Applicant in her acquisition of\ninformation were named and lesser sanctions recommended; of the man giving\nApplicant security clearance information, it was merely recommended that he \u201cshould\nalso receive appropriate administrative actions for aiding and abiding (sic) [Applicant].\u201d37\nOf all the interviews, only the statement of the woman whose privacy was the subject of\nthe investigation and the statement of the woman who told her Applicant gossiped\nabout the woman\u2019s marriage depict Applicant in a gossipy manner. In contrast to the\ninvestigator\u2019s assessment, Applicant\u2019s former supervisor and friend testified that\nApplicant is not a gossip, but a discreet employee.  She stated Applicant is not the\n38\n\n Tr. 82.\n    39\n Tr. 89.\n    40\n Tr. 82-83.\n    41\n7\ntype to seek personnel information for her own personal benefit. At work, her former\nsupervisor felt Applicant demonstrated good judgment.\nApplicant did not leave government service because she thought she was under\ninvestigation.  Indeed, although she had some suspicions she might be involved in\n39\nsome of the scenarios discussed,  she never knew she was under investigation until\n40\nshe received an interrogatory from DOHA in September 2007 and a response to a\nFOIA request in December 2007.  Consequently, when she completed her August\n41\n2006 e-QIP she answered \u201cno\u201d to Section 22. That section inquired whether any of the\nfollowing have happened to the Applicant in the past seven years: 1) Fired from a job;\n2) quit a job after being told you would be fired; 3) left a job by mutual agreement\nfollowing allegation of misconduct; 4) left a job by mutual agreement following allegation\nof unsatisfactory performance; 5) left a job for other reasons under unfavorable\ncircumstances. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the\nSOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n    42\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n    43\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n    44\n Id.\n    45\n Id.\n    46\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    47\n8\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of\n42\nevidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n43\n44\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n45\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n46\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n47\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be\nthe most pertinent to the case. Personal conduct concerns under AG \u00b6 15 arise from\nquestions regarding one\u2019s ability to protect classified information. Conditions pertaining\nto this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed below.\nAnalysis\nThe SOR posed four allegations, all of which Applicant denied. Two of those\nallegations are predicated on the assertion that Applicant knew she was the subject of\n\n Indeed, Applicant is not named in one interview statement and only referenced in passing in two of the\n    48\nseven interview statements (not including Applicant\u2019s own). See Case File, Military Investigative Records\nRepository File (Ex. 6, Statement of Dec. 8, 2003); Case File, Military Investigative Records Repository File\n(Ex. 5, Statement of Dec. 11, 2003); Case File, Military Investigative Records Repository File (Ex. 2,\nStatement of Dec. 12, 2003), respectively.\n At most, Applicant \u201csuspected\u201d she might have something to do with some of the things discussed, but\n    49\nshe had no idea she was the subject of any investigation.\n Additionally, refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions in connection with a\n    50\npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative determination of further processing for clearance eligibility.\n9\nan investigation when she resigned from her position in December 2003 and when she\ncompleted the August 2006 e-QIP. Predicating those allegations on that assumption is\nfatal inasmuch as there is no evidence to suggest Applicant knew she, or specifically\nher conduct, was the subject of an investigation either before or after she left for her\nnew position. Indeed, the memorandum appointing an investigator and the resultant\ninvestigative report make it clear the investigation was an effort to reveal facts\nsurrounding an allegation that personal information about a particular individual had\nbeen improperly disclosed. Applicant\u2019s name and activities did not emerge until after\nthe interviews were commenced and, even then, her activities were seldom the focus of\ndiscussion.  Moreover, the facts make it clear that Applicant\u2019s motivation for departing\n48\nfrom her position when she did was not to avoid an investigation, but to accept a\npreviously negotiated and far more lucrative private sector job. Furthermore, there is\nsimply no evidence to counter Applicant\u2019s testimony she had no knowledge the\ninvestigation concerned her directly.  Lacking proof Applicant was under investigation\n49\nand that she knew she was under investigation, she is technically correct in denying she\nwas \u201cthe subject of an investigation conducted by [the government]\u201d as a result of her\nactions from July 2002 through December 2003 (SOR 1.b), \u201cresigned from her position.\n. . during the investigation regarding your misconduct\u201d (SOR 1.c), and \u201cfailed to disclose\nthat [she] left [federal employment] during an investigation regarding your misconduct.\u201d\n(SOR 1.d).\nAllegation 1.a: \u201cDuring the period from July 2002 through December 2003,\n[Applicant] accessed information regarding fellow employees which [she] did not have a\nneed to know\u201d remains. Security concerns arising from matters of personal conduct are\ncontrolled by Guideline E of the AG. Such security concerns arise in the presence of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations which could indicate that the person\nmay not properly safeguard classified information.50\nThrough a former associate, Applicant requested information on the status of\nvarious colleagues\u2019 security clearances. Those entrusted with such information\nimparted it freely in response. There is no evidence indicating how \u201cneed to know\u201d was\ndefined in their workplace. The evidence does not support a finding that Applicant was\nsubject to, and aware of, any specific prohibition to what she was doing. The evidence\ndoes support, however, a finding that she was specifically told to mind her own\n\n10\nbusiness with regard to her cubicle mate\u2019s pending security clearance status. Having\ninformed her superiors of her concerns, that matter should have been dropped after\ntheir decision had been made. Such facts give rise to Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16((c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative\nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information) and AG \u00b616(d)\n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline\nand may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when\ncombined with all available information supports a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information).\nThe conduct at issue occurred in 2003 \u2013 five years ago. At the time, Applicant\nstill maintained contact with former colleagues in the FOIA/PA office which could\naccess status information on security clearances. Whether information on newer\ncolleagues\u2019 security clearances was granted to Applicant as a courtesy extended to an\nold friend or whether that office was unusually free with its freedom of information is\nunclear. What is clear is that the incidents occurred several years ago, Applicant has\nlong since moved into the private sector, and there is no indication that any other\nquestionable incidents have since occurred or might occur in her present position. \nThe evidence as a whole, however, indicates that it was the culture, not\nApplicant, that was at fault here. The office in possession of the information sought\ngave it to Applicant freely, yet those who actively retrieved and disclosed information\nfrom the database were recommended a lesser sanction than Applicant despite the fact\nthey were the ones entrusted with access to the database. The main informant, upon\nwhose own gossip and hearsay the subject of the investigation relied, conceded she\navailed herself of Applicant\u2019s contacts and that she waited nearly a year before openly\nwaging her accusations against Applicant. In light of the passage of five years,\nApplicant\u2019s new employment, and the accepted practices within her former employment\nculture, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Moreover,\nApplicant aggressively expressed some of her concerns regarding colleagues\u2019 working\non or around classified information despite pending security clearances with her\nsuperiors, albeit without results. Later, during her December 2003 interview, Applicant\u2019s\nsolicited statement as to many of the facts now at issue was direct and forthcoming.\nSuch facts give rise to PC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress).\n\n11\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a mature individual with a unique blend of military,\ncivilian government, and private sector experience During most of her service, she\nworked in the area of intelligence. Consequently, she has experience working within\nstated parameters. Moreover, in her penultimate position as a government civilian, she\nworked in a FOIA/PA office which had access to the database for security clearance\nindices. In her next job, she felt unfettered in making inquiries regarding colleagues\u2019\nsecurity clearance statuses. The majority, if not all, of these requests were made with\nthe acquiescence, if not the urging, of the colleague at issue. Applicant\u2019s contacts\npossessing access to the database felt equally unfettered in confirming an individual\u2019s\nsecurity clearance was still under investigation or pending. \nTo the extent such requests were made with the approval of the individual whose\nsecurity clearance processing was stalled, there can be no issue of a privacy violation\ninasmuch as any such right would have been waived upon request or acquiescence.\nWhat the agency defined \u201cneed to know\u201d is never clearly stated and no guidance is\ngiven in the investigative report as to what, if any, established rule or disseminated\nregulation Applicant violated in requesting such information. Without some standard for\nguidance, there is no evidence security concerns remain or that Applicant mishandled\nor failed to protect classified information. \nThe protection of classified information is the central concern in issues regarding\npersonal conduct. Viewing Applicant\u2019s record as a whole, there is no clear evidence that\nin nearly 30 years of military, civilian government, and private sector service she ever\nmishandled or failed to protect classified information. In light of the totality of the\ncircumstances, and given the depiction of procedures used within her former work\nenvironment, Applicant has mitigated personal conduct security concerns. Moreover,\nher actions here do not violate the level of trust expected under Guideline E. With\nsecurity concerns thus mitigated, it is clearly consistent with the national security to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n\n12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is granted.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 9, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLokey-Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(E-QIP), on December 14, 2006.  On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 26, 2007, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on December 26, 2007.  The Applicant was instructed to submit\ninformation in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant\nreceived the FORM on January 7, 2008, and he submitted no reply.\nThe case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on March 27, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 35 years old and unmarried.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor in the Design Training Program and is seeking to obtain a security clearance\nin connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to the following seven creditors totalling\nthe approximate amount of $25,632.00, as set forth in the SOR in allegations 1(a)\nthrough 1(j).  (See Government Exhibit 3).  A delinquent debt to CBCS/MCI Com in the\namount of $29.00 remains owing.  A delinquent debt to EQUIDATA in the amount of\n$522.00 remains owing.   A delinquent deb to HILCORECV/DOMINION in the amount\nof $187.00 remains owing.  Two delinquent debts to SALLIE MAE in the amount of\n$2,625.00 and $4,000.00 remain owing.  Two delinquent debts to the Department of\nEducation in the amount of $4,065.00 and $3,282.00 remain owing.  Two delinquent\ndebts to AMS-SG in the amounts of $2,000.00 and $500.00 remain owing.  A delinquent\ndebt to US DEPT ED in the amount of $8,411.00 remains owing.  (See Government\nExhibits 5, 6 and 7).     \nMost of the Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are for student loans.  He states that he\nintends to get them back into a non-delinquent status once he returns to school to finish\nhis Engineering degree.  He also plans to pay them in their entirety once he completes\nhis degree.  With respect to his other delinquent debts, he plans to contact the creditors\nand either pay off the debt or set up a payment schedule to do so.  \nHe explained that for a period of time he had taken on all of the household\nexpenses while his fianc\u00e9 worked part-time while completing her degree.  She\ngraduated in June 2007, with her Masters in Business Administration and has since\nobtained employment with a salary comparable enough for her to assume all of the\nexpenses that the Applicant was once responsible for.  In his answer to the SOR, the\nApplicant stated in part...\u201dAt the current time I am obligated to make contact with Sallie\nMae and the Department of Education and arrange a payment schedule comparable\nwith my salary.  The other delinquencies will be given my immediate attention for\nrepayment and removal from my credit report\u201d.  (See Government Item 3, p.1).       \nThe Applicant has presented no explanation or documentary evidence to\ndemonstrate how he will pay off his delinquent debts.\n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)\n inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)\n a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \n\n4\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n5\nThe Applicant is indebted to seven separate creditors and owes in excess of\n$25,000.00.  With respect to these past due debts, he has done nothing to resolve\nthem.  He has presented no evidence as to how he will pay them.  Furthermore,\nalthough he plans to re-enter school and properly defer his student loans, to get them\nout of a delinquent status, he has obviously not done so yet, as he has presented no\ndocumentary evidence demonstrating this.  At the present time, he remains indebted to\neach of his creditors. He has failed to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility, or that he has resolved his financial indebtedness.  Considering all of the\nevidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case. \nThere is no evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions apply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not isolated,\nand the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n6\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant maintains occasional contact, by telephone and email, with some of\nthem.\nApplicant traveled to the PRC in 1992, in 1999 to attend his father\u2019s funeral, and\nin 2005 to visit relatives.\nApplicant states he is a loyal American who has lived in the United States \u201cfor\nover 17 years and will live here the rest of life.\u201d2\nThe Government provided six official United States publications with the FORM\nthat describe the economic, political and intelligence activities of the PRC. The\nGovernment requested that these documents be admitted into evidence. I have\nadmitted the documents into evidence, and I take administrative notice of the following\nfacts found therein:\nThe PRC, which has a population of over 1.3 billion people, is ruled by an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC\n\nUnited States Department of State, Background Note: China, October 2007 at pages 3, 7, and 9.\n 3\n United States Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2006 (China).\n4\n lnteragency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook at page 7.\n5\n 2007 United States - China Economic and Security Review Commission Report to Congress, pages 104\n6\nand 106.\n3\ncontinues to have a poor human rights record. Reported abuses have included arbitrary\nand lengthy incommunicado detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of\nprisoners.3\nPRC authorities monitor telephone communications, facsimile transmissions,\nemail, text messaging, and Internet communications.   \n4\nThe Intelligence Threat Handbook identifies PRC intelligence activities toward\nthe United States as follows: \u201cThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China\nbecause of the United States role as a global superpower; its substantial military,\npolitical, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a developer of\nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of\nAmericans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence targets by the\nPRC.\u201d  \n5\nOf the 140 foreign intelligence agencies continuously attempting to penetrate\nUnited States agencies, the PRC\u2019s is the most aggressive. Officials from United States\nconsider the PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the\nsecurity of United States technology.6\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n\n4\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph i., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\n\n5\nApplicant has weekly contact with his mother, and less frequent but regular\ncontact with his three siblings, all of whom are residents and citizens of the PRC. In\naddition, since moving to the United States in 1990, he has visited the PRC three times,\nthe last time in 2005, well after he became a United States citizen. Even though his trip\nto the PRC was for the purpose of visiting family members, his presence in the PRC\nmade him and his family members potentially vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or\ncoercion by the PRC government, which actively seeks to obtain classified or\nproprietary information from United States citizens of Chinese ancestry who work for\nUnited States government contractors. These facts raise concerns under all three\ndisqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe nature\nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate\n\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s contacts\nwith his mother and siblings in the PRC are frequent and ongoing. His relationship with\nthem, particularly with his mother, is one of loyalty and obligation, raising the concern\nthat these relationships create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant failed\nto provide credible evidence that it is unlikely he would placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign government and the interests of the United\nStates, or that he is not vulnerable to a conflict of interest.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\n\n6\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born, raised, and received most of his education in the PRC. He\nand his family have resided in the United States for approximately 17 years. Applicant,\nhis wife, and daughter became United States citizens in 2002. Their second child was\nborn here. The evidence establishes that applicant has provided valuable service and\nexpertise to United States government civilian and military operations as both a\ngovernment employee and an employee of a United States government contractor. He\nis also an honorable family member who seeks to maintain contact with his mother and\nsiblings who are citizens and residents of the PRC. In carrying out his family\nresponsibilities, he has made choices to travel to the PRC, and these choices could also\nmake him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure and could cause the future\ncompromise of classified information. I have carefully reviewed the administrative\nrecord, applicant*s submissions, and the allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and I have evaluated applicant*s\nconduct in light of the whole person concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure\n2 of the Directive. After doing so, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the\nGovernment\u2019s case under Guideline B.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 16, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on April 30, 2007.\nOn April 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on June 25, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on August 11, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 16, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on October 2, 2008.\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 11, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C, which were\nadmitted without objection. Upon Applicant\u2019s request the record remained open until\n\n2\nOctober 10, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit further documentation. Applicant did not\nsupply any other documentation into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on October 14, 2008. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.j., with some\nexplanations. Regarding allegations 2.a., through 2.e., he admitted in part and denied in\npart. The admitted allegations, 1.a., through 1.j., are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is married, and he and his wife have five children.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 9 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.i., and one\nallegation regarding bankruptcy, 1.j., under Adjudicative Guideline F. As discussed\nabove, in his RSOR, Applicant admitted that all of these debts remain overdue and\nunpaid. During his testimony, Applicant also admitted that all of the debts were still due\nand owing. All of the debts will be reviewed in the same order as they were listed in the\nSOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,365.\nApplicant testified that he plans to pay off this debt, but at this time, it remains unpaid. \n1.b. This overdue debt also to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$600. Applicant testified that he plans to pay off this debt, but at this time, it remains\nunpaid. \n1.c. This third overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$1,200. Applicant testified that he plans to pay off this debt, but at this time, it remains\nunpaid. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $847.\nApplicant testified that he plans to pay off this debt, but at this time, it remains unpaid. \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $396.\nApplicant testified that he has been in contact with this creditor and has agreed to a\npayment plan where he will pay the creditor half of his debt by October 10, 2008, and\nthe second half by November 10, 2008. He is waiting for the paperwork confirming the\nagreement. At this time this debt remains unpaid. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $30,597.\nThis debt is as a result of Applicant\u2019s house being foreclosed. It is not clear whether this\ndebt falls under the state\u2019s anti-deficiency statute, which limits a homeowner\u2019s liability to\nthe value that the creditor can receive from the home after it has been repossessed.\nSince no evidence was submitted regarding this debt, it has not been established if this\ndebt has been extinguished or if it is still due and owing.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $10,092.\nApplicant testified that he plans to pay off this debt, but at this time, it remains unpaid. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $807.\nApplicant testified that he does not know what was is the basis of this debt. He has not\ncontacted the creditor to ascertain what the debt is for, and at this time, the debt\nremains unpaid.  \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,223.\nApplicant testified that he plans to pay off this debt, but at this time, it remains unpaid. \n1.j. On March 24, 2006, Applicant filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy. The bankruptcy was dismissed on April 3, 2007. While it is alleged in the\nSOR, that the bankruptcy was dismissed because Applicant failed to make payments in\naccordance with the bankruptcy plan, Applicant testified that he dismissed the\nbankruptcy because he did not believe that his attorney was properly representing him.\nAs a result of the dismissed bankruptcy none of Applicant\u2019s debts was discharged or\nresolved. \nApplicant gave two very different reasons for his for his financial difficulties. At\nthe hearing, he testified that his problems occurred because his mother-in-law died, and\nhe and his wife took into their home and supported his wife\u2019s two sisters and the\ndaughter of one of her sisters. However, in a letter, written by Applicant on October 1,\n2008, and submitted into evidence as Exhibit A, he stated, \u201cWe underestimated\nourselves when we moved into a house from an apartment . . . We have also learned\nthat it takes a budget between two people in order to prosper in life.\u201d  Nowhere in this\nletter does he ever mention his wife\u2019s sisters, as even one of the reasons for his\nfinancial difficulties. And when he testified he failed to discuss his moving from an\napartment to a home or his failure to have a budget as reasons for his problems. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s two different explanations and his total lack of credibility, as\nwill be reviewed under Guideline E, below, there is no way to know what the actual\nreason is for his financial difficulties. \n\n4\nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on November 3, 2006 (Exhibit 3).\nQuestion 28.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\n1.d.,  and 1.g., above. It appears that Applicant should have included all of the debts\nlisted as 1.a. through 1.i., above.\n2.b. Question 28.b. asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\n1.d., 1.f, and 1.g., above. It appears that Applicant should have also included all of the\ndebts listed as 1.a. through 1.i., above.\n2.c. Question 27.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any\nchapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this\nquestion.  The Government alleges that Applicant should have included the Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, as reviewed in 1.j., above.  \n2.d. Question 23,d. asks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs.\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question.  The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included his arrest and conviction for\nPossession of Marijuana on June 1, 1999, for which he was fined $100 and required to\nattend a drug treatment program.  At the hearing, Applicant admitted the 1999\nmarijuana conviction. \n2.e. Question 24,a. asks, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is\nshorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance . . .\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d\nto this question.  The Government alleges that Applicant should have included his\nmarijuana usage during the period within seven years of his completion of the SCA.\nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana from 1992 to at least October 2000. At the\nhearing, Applicant admitted he had used marijuana in the years stated. \nApplicant testified that he was not trying to mislead the Government. He gave a\nnumber of excuses for his failure to give truthful and complete answers on his SCA.\nThese included: he did not read the questions properly, he was tired and was thinking\nabout going home, he was not in the right state of mind, he miscalculated or was\nconfused regarding the dates for his marijuana conviction and possession, and he\nmisunderstood the questions. I find that these reasons to do not explain how his\nresponses could be so incorrect, incomplete and misleading in five different responses.\nApplicant  offered into evidence one letter from an individual, who knows\nApplicant in his professional life (Exhibit C). He wrote in positive terms about Applicant.\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy\nhis debts, and his long history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve any of his overdue debts, even those for which the amount is not significant.   I,\ntherefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect, untruthful, incomplete material information on five separate questions that he\nprovided to the Government on the SCA that he executed on November 3, 2006.\nBecause of the extant of his lack of honesty and candor regarding very clearly written\nquestions, I find that Applicant did intend to mislead the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that because Applicant\ndeliberately omitted and concealed relevant facts from a SCA that DC 16.

I therefore, resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\n\n7\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, and his failure to give honest\ncomplete information to the Government, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

McGlinn, Esquire\nMcGlinn & McGlinn\nFebruary 12, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), on December 21, 2006, (Government Exhibit 1). On April 18, 2008,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nstating why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to\ndetermine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\n\n2\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 6, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non May 21, 2008.  This case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 10, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n15, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were\nreceived without objection. The Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one\nadditional witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K, also without\nobjection.  The record was left open at the Applicant\u2019s request for the submission of\nadditional documentation.  The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L on August 20,\n2008.  This exhibit was also received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing on August 25, 2008.  The record closed on August 25, 2008.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 47, single and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  She is employed by a\nDefense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment\nin the defense industry.  In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in\nParagraph 1 of the SOR and denied all of the allegations in Paragraph 2.  She also\nprovided explanations with her responses.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she in financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to obtain funds.\nThe Applicant was born and raised in State One.  In 2004, her brother was\ndiagnosed with a terminal illness in State Two, where he owned a business.  The\nApplicant left her job in State One and moved to State Two, where she took over\nrunning her brother\u2019s business during the period before his death.  After her brother died\nin 2005, the Applicant wound up the affairs of his company in a successful fashion.\n(Transcript at 52-54; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and E.)  Needless to say, the Applicant was\naffected by her brother\u2019s death.\n1.a.  The Applicant was indebted to a bank in State One in the approximate\namount of $1,166.00.  This debt was paid in full on May 6, 2008.  (Transcript at 49-52;\nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\n1.b.  The Applicant owed a medical debt in the amount of $809.00.  The evidence\nshows that the Applicant believed the debt should have been covered by her then\n\n3\nemployer\u2019s medical insurance.  Once she was informed of the debt, the Applicant took\nsteps to pay it, and did so on April 30, 2008.  (Transcript at 37-40; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nG.) \n1.c.  The Applicant bought a timeshare in June 1998.  She made payments for\nthree years, until June 2001.  The Applicant was dissatisfied with the timeshare and felt\nthat the owners had not fulfilled their responsibilities.  She stopped paying on the\ntimeshare because of these issues and returned ownership.  At that point she had paid\n$6,469.79 in principal, interest and fees. According to the documentary evidence\nprovided by the owners, the Applicant\u2019s debt was cancelled on November 29, 2001.\nThe Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence is that she did not, and does not, believe\nshe owes this creditor any more money.  (Transcript at 40-41, 45-47, 54-61;\nGovernment Exhibits 6, 7, 8 and 9; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.)\nThe two most recent credit reports in the record are Government Exhibit 6 and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit J.  Both of them reflect that, as of the Summer of 2008, she had no\npast due indebtedness.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has made false statements to the Department of Defense during\nthe clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant filled out an e-QIP in December 2006 in which she stated that she\nwas not currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  She also stated that, within the\npast seven years, she had not been over 180 days delinquent on any debts.\n(Government Exhibit 1 at questions 28(a) and 28(b).)  These answers were not true, as\nthe Applicant did owe at least two of the three debts discussed above.\nThe Applicant testified at length on this issue.  (Transcript at 36-37, 40-41, 47-48,\n60-61.)  She was apologetic for not discussing these debts on her questionnaire, but\nalso consistently and credibly testified that she did not intentionally provide false\ninformation about them.  Rather, based on the available evidence, it appears that she,\npossibly in the emotion of her brother\u2019s illness and death, forgot the debt in 1.a. when\nfilling out the questionnaire; did not know about the debt in 1.b., and legitimately\nbelieved she did not owe any money to the creditor in 1.c.  Under the particular facts of\nthis case, I find that while her answers were false, she did not intend to mislead the\nGovernment in any way.  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant is a highly respected person in her field.  A former co-worker and\nfriend testified for the Applicant.  The witness stated that the Applicant is very\ntrustworthy and believable.  (Transcript at 20-29; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \n\n4\nThe Applicant also presented recommendations from a co-worker and supervisor\nthat are very laudatory.  The letters describe the Applicant as \u201cprofessional and ethical,\u201d\n\u201chonest, responsible,\u201d and \u201cstraight forward.\u201d  Both of these people recommend the\nApplicant for a position of trust.  (Transcript at 43-44; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C.)  Her\nPerformance Reviews show that she \u201cMeets Performance Expectations.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits H and I.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n5\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant had financial difficulties (Guideline F), and that the Applicant\nmade false statements in the clearance screening process (Guideline E.)  The\nApplicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay several of her debts for a period of years.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.  Two of these debts dated from the 2000-2001 time frame.  The Applicant\nhas paid one in full, and reasonably believes that she has no liability towards the other.\nThe evidence raises this mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., . . . death), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Applicant moved from State One to State Two because of her brother\u2019s illness and\ndeath.  She successfully wound up his business, but did not pay in a timely manner a\nsingle pre-existing debt amounting to less than $1,200.00. This debt has since been\npaid.  The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant showed that\nshe has successfully paid off two of the three debts alleged in the SOR, in addition to\nshowing a good current credit history.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition\napplies.\nFinally, \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  As set forth at length above, the\nApplicant had a legitimate dispute concerning the debt in 1.c.  While this debt was\nreported to the credit agencies as delinquent, there is evidence that this debt was\n\u201ccancelled\u201d by the creditor.  This mitigating condition clearly applies to the facts of this\ncase.  For all the foregoing reasons, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Applicant did provide false information on her questionnaire concerning the\nthree debts alleged in the SOR.  However, the evidence is clear that the Applicant did\nnot have a good idea of the extent of her financial difficulties until receipt of\ndocumentation from the Government.  Despite the Department Counsel\u2019s best efforts,\nand looked at in the manner most favorable for the Government, the evidence does not\nsupport a finding that the Applicant intentionally falsified her Questionnaire.  Human\nbeings, and not just the Applicant, make mistakes.  She told the Government all the\ninformation that she knew.  That information was incomplete.  That is all that has\nhappened here.  Guideline E is found for the Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, in particular her payment of two of\nthe debts alleged in the SOR, the fact that the third was \u201ccancelled,\u201d and her\nunintentionally false statements to the Government.  Three of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case.  First, I find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  The\nApplicant has shown that her failure to pay her debts was a temporary situation that has\nbeen corrected.  In addition, she is an overwhelmingly truthful person.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  Finally, the \u201clikelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence\u201d discussed in AG \u00b6 2(a)(9) is virtually nil. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is granted.\nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on July 30, 2006. After reviewing the results of the\nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nDecember 19, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\n2\nOn March 13, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nwhich specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2\nApplicant received the SOR on April 28, 2008. She signed her Answer on June 2,\n2008. In response to a request from DOHA that she clarify her Answer, she submitted a\nsecond answer on July 11, 2008, in which she admitted to all allegations in the Statement\nof Reasons except the following: \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d. through 1.f. and 1.p. through 1.u. She also\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 29, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me on September 3, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October\n23, 2008 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 13, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, the government offered nine exhibits, which wrre marked as\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 through 9 and admitted without objection. Applicant testified,\npresented the testimony of three witnesses, and offered five exhibits, which were marked\nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through E and received without objection. I held the record\nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted three\ndocuments, which were forwarded without objection by Department Counsel. The\ndocuments were admitted as AE F, G and H on November 26, 2008, and the record closed\non that day. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on November 21, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant, 39 years old, graduated high school and completed one year of college.\nShe married in 1993, and is currently separated. She and her husband have two daughters,\n15 and 22 years of age, and two sons, 14 and 16 years old. Three of the children live with\nApplicant, and one is married and lives on her own (Tr. 67; 95). Two are special-needs\nchildren (Answer). Applicant has worked for the same federal government agency for the\npast 18 years, 10 years as a government employee, and 8 years as an independent\ncontractor (Tr 26). She began in a secretarial position and progressed to her current\nposition in Information Technology. Her first security clearance was granted approximately\neight years ago.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s gross income in 2007 was $58,000 (Tr 73). Her net monthly income is\n$3200, or approximately $39,000 annually. Her monthly expenses (rent, utilities, car\npayment, communications, insurance, school expenses, food and clothing) amount to\napproximately $1,600. Until two weeks before the hearing, she also paid $300 per month\ntoward a federal tax lien and had no monthly remaining income after she met her expenses.\nShe now has $300 per month available since she has completed paying the tax lien. She\nplans to use the money to pay her remaining debts (Tr 63-71). \nWhile Applicant and her husband were living together, she did not have problems\nwith delinquent debt. She was able to obtain a truck loan in her own name in 2003, and was\npre-approved for a home loan in 2004 (Tr 76 - 78). However, during the period 1994 to\n2005, Applicant\u2019s husband physically abused and threatened her. She left several times,\nliving in five different locations since 1995 (Tr 74). She reconciled each time because her\nhusband threatened Applicant with death, or bodily harm to her or her mother, if she left (Tr\n60-61). \nApplicant obtained the first Protective Order against her husband in June 2005 (AE\nC). The second and third Protective Orders were obtained in November 2005 by Applicant\nand her daughter when Applicant\u2019s husband fought with them and threw his daughter down\na flight of stairs (AE D and E; Tr 33-35). He then disappeared, taking the younger children\nwith him. Applicant contacted the police who forced him to return the children. Her husband\nwas incarcerated for two weeks (Tr 79). Since Applicant and her husband\u2019s final separation\nin 2005, Applicant has been the sole support of the children, as she has been unable to\nlocate him to obtain child support. The necessity to support her children without financial\nhelp from her husband has resulted in numerous debts becoming delinquent. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a, friend and a co-worker testified that Applicant is an\noutstanding and dependable worker. Each of the witnesses was aware of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems and described her as a caring mother who has been struggling to do her\nbest under difficult circumstances (Tr. 88-98 ).\nIn 2001, Applicant\u2019s husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in an effort to\nsave his house. He was told his income alone would be insufficient to meet the payment\nplan. He asked Applicant to join the petition, which she did. Her understanding was that the\nbankruptcy was his, and her credit would not be affected because no debts of hers were\nlisted in the petition (Tr 43). Subsequently, she contacted the mortgage company and\nobtained a modification to their mortgage loan, so that the bankruptcy was not necessary.\nApplicant\u2019s husband voluntarily dismissed the bankruptcy petition. She denies that it was\ndismissed for failure to confirm the plan, as stated in the petition (GE 5). \nApplicant\u2019s husband refused to allow her to drive the one car they owned. As her\ncredit was good, Applicant purchased a truck. Her husband wanted to drive it and it caused\nfrequent arguments. To resolve the conflict, Applicant purposefully allowed two payments\nto lapse so that the company would take back the truck. Applicant testified, \n\nDirective. 6.3.\n3 \n4\nThey came and got the truck. Once he found out that they\ncame and got the truck back, he put a gun to my head and\nthreatened to kill me if I didn\u2019t get the truck back (Tr 29-30).\n.Applicant made the payments and the truck was returned. When she left after this\nincident, she left the truck. Her husband said he would keep up the loan payments, but\nfailed to do so. The truck was ultimately repossessed, leaving a deficiency (allegation 1.o.).\nIn 2007, Applicant contacted a credit counseling service, which developed a plan to\npay nine debts with a monthly payment of $141 per month (GE 3). She did not begin the\nplan because she could not afford both the proposed payment, her other monthly expenses,\nand her $300 per month payment to satisfy the federal tax lien (Tr. 51). Applicant does not\nuse credit cards (Tr 72).\nThe current status of the alleged debts is as follows:\nallegation 1.a. - 1.j. - medical debts - co-pays for doctor visits as well as several\nhospital visits; unpaid (Tr 57-59)\nallegation 1.k. - 1. n. and 1.r. - utilities - Applicant\u2019s husband remained in house\nafter Applicant left with children; he promised to pay these utilities that were in Applicant\u2019s\nname but failed to do so; unpaid (Tr 56)\nallegation 1.o. - truck loan - deficiency balance after truck Applicant purchased was\nrepossessed when her husband failed to maintain payments; unpaid (Tr 29-30; 55-56)\nallegation 1.p. - Federal tax lien - Paid/ AE G\nallegation 1.q - MD state tax lien - Applicant disputes; has contacted the state tax\noffice but the dispute has not been resolved (Tr 52-54);\nallegation 1.s. - retail goods debt - Applicant disputed debt in the past and it was\nremoved from her credit report; Government agrees Applicant does not owe debt (Tr 73)\nallegation 1.t. and 1.u. - Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing and dismissal - see\ndiscussion at page 3.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n5\nIn this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nconsideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations).  \n          A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue\n4\nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to\nprove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then\nfalls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable\ndoubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-extended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b619a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies.\nApplicant had good credit while she lived with her husband, but when she was forced to\nleave him, she was unable to keep up with the debts on a single salary. AG \u00b619c (a history\n\n6\nof not meeting financial obligations) also applies. Applicant\u2018s credit bureau reports show\nthat she has had delinquencies, primarily since 2005 when she left her husband for the last\ntime (GE 2), demonstrating a history of failing to meet financial obligations. There is no\nevidence of other disqualifying conditions such as frivolous spending, or debts related to\nalcoholism, gambling or deceptive practices. \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20b and AG \u00b6 20e apply, and AG \u00b6 20c and\nAG \u00b6 20d apply in part. \nI find that AG \u00b6 20b applies (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant tried to maintain her family in the\nface of a physically and mentally abusive husband who threatened her and her mother,\nand threw his own daughter down a flight of stairs. After obtaining a total of three\nProtective Orders against him, Applicant finally felt that she had to leave for her own\nsafety and that of her children. Once the family was safe, she was faced with supporting\nfive people on her own salary, as her husband could not be found and did not contribute\nchild support. Despite these hardships, she has acted responsibly, maintaining her\nemployment, keeping her family together and making efforts to deal with her debts.\nIn addition, although numerous debts are in Applicant\u2019s name, they are delinquent\nbecause of her husband\u2019s actions, which she could not control. He forced her to retrieve\nthe truck she returned to the dealer (allegation 1.o.), and when she allowed him to keep\nit, he failed to make the payments. As to the debts at allegations 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., they\nwere utilities that her husband failed to pay after she left him, and allowed him to remain\nin the house. Although these debts were in Applicant\u2019s name, it was her husband who was\nusing the house and the truck. Yet, given his past abuse, she could not force him to pay\nthem. The debts amount to approximately $7,500. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies partially. Applicant contacted a financial counseling service in October 2007, long\nbefore the SOR was issued. In the payment plan, she included nine debts, all of which\nwould have been paid by the end of 2009 (GE 3). However, Applicant did not have a\nsufficient monthly remainder to pay the $141 per month that would have been required,\nand she could not carry out the plan. I find some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) because\neven though the payment plan was not workable, Applicant made a good-faith effort to\nfind a way to resolve her debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant provided documentation (AE G) that she paid\nthe federal tax lien of $7,898 (allegation 1.p.). Applicant now has $300 per month\navailable that formerly was applied to that debt, and hopes to set up a new plan with the\ncredit counseling service using that money to pay the remaining debts (Tr 41).\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue)\nalso applies. Applicant disputes the debts for state taxes and retail goods and has\ncontacted both creditors. Although she has been unable to resolve the state tax lien at this\npoint, she did contact the credit reporting agency about the incorrect retail goods debt,\nand it was removed from her credit report. In addition, it does not appear on her current\ncredit report (GE 4). I find, and government agrees, that Applicant does not owe this debt\n(Tr 73).\nWhole Person Analysis  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nApplicant previously had solid credit as shown by her ability to obtain a truck loan\nand pre-approval for a home loan. Her landlords attest to her reliability as a tenant (AE A\nand B). Her witnesses confirm her strong work ethic and responsibility. Applicant has been\nemployed by the same agency for 18 years, demonstrating a stable work history. To keep\nherself and her children safe, she left her abusive husband. But supporting herself and\nfour children, including two special-needs children, on her single salary, was not possible\nwithout incurring delinquencies. A significant portion of her debt was beyond her control,\nincluding $7,500 that is due to her husband\u2019s actions. She has paid the $7,898 tax lien,\ndoes not owe the debt for retail goods, and does not use credit cards. Applicant has had\na difficult time over the past 10 years, and has demonstrated strong character in the face\nof significant hardship. Her trustworthiness and reliability are not at issue.\nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\n\n8\nsecurity concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline F\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 16, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn December 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 2, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 7, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on March 14, 2008. The case was assigned to me on March 27,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was indebted to a police department on an account placed for\ncollection in 1999. He satisfied the debt in February 2008.\nApplicant is indebted to United Airlines Employees Credit in the approximate\namount of $610.00. This debt was placed for collection in 2000. In his response to the\nFORM, applicant stated he \u201cconnected\u201d with the collection agency and they had no\nrecord of his name or social security number. He further stated he is \u201ctrying to do some\nresearch in order to satisfy debt.\u201d\nApplicant is indebted to Wachovia Bank in the approximate amount of\n$11,611.00 as a result of a student loan he defaulted on that was subsequently charged\noff in 2004. In his response to the FORM, applicant stated the debt is now with a\ncollection agency (ACT) and that he \u201cwas able to arrange a $231.00 monthly payment\nwith ACT after making a $1,000.00 down payment.\u201d He further stated that the monthly\npayments begin on March 28, 2008. He attached to his FORM response two letters\nfrom ACT establishing they received two $500.00 post dated checks from applicant in\nFebruary 2008.\nApplicant is indebted to British Petroleum in the approximate amount of $108.00\non an account that was placed for collection in January 2005. In his response to the\nFORM, applicant stated, \u201cAccount paid in full, still waiting for a copy of the statement.\u201d\nApplicant was indebted to Cingular Wireless in the approximate amount of\n$1,307.00. In March 2005, this debt was placed with Cavalry for collection. Applicant\nrecently satisfied the debt.\nApplicant was indebted to TCF National Bank in the approximate amount of\n$626.00 on an account referred to AMR and then to ACC for collection. This debt was\nsatisfied by applicant on December 27, 2007.\nApplicant is indebted to ARS in the approximate amount of $726.00 for a debt\nreferred to it for collection by US Cellular in 2006.\nA Personal Financial Statement dated September 25, 2007 indicates applicant\nhad a positive monthly cash flow of approximately $1,382.00.\nApplicant completed an electronic questionnaire for national security positions\n(EQNSP) in January 2006. In response to two questions on the EQNSP, applicant\ndenied that (1) in the prior seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt and (2) he was then over 90 days delinquent on any debts. As documented above,\napplicant was well over 180 days delinquent on many debts when he completed the\nEQNSP. In his response to the SOR, applicant explained his denials by stating he was\nnot aware of these debts until he was interviewed by an investigator in February 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his denials is not credible. It is simply unbelievable that he\n\n3\nwould not have recalled any of these delinquent debts, particularly his large student\nloan debt, when he completed the EQNSP.\nA letter from applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor during the past two years was\nattached to applicant\u2019s SOR response. In it, the supervisor stated that applicant has\nbeen a \u201cstellar\u201d performer who is \u201csimply the best employee\u201d she has.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a long history of an inability\nor unwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although applicant has made\nsome progress dealing with his delinquent debt, his failure to honor his financial\nobligations is both recent and frequent. Furthermore, having been provided no credible\nevidence explaining the circumstances leading up to his financial irresponsibility, it is\nimpossible to conclude his financial irresponsibility will not recur. Accordingly, this\nmitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\npresented no credible evidence that would justify application of this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant\nprovided proof that he satisfied three of the seven debts alleged in the SOR, and stated\nhe paid a fourth and is waiting for a \u201ccopy of the statement.\u201d He also stated that he\nworked out a payment agreement with his largest creditor, ACT, requiring him to make a\n$1,000.00 deposit and then $231.00 monthly payments. Although he did not provide a\ncopy of the agreement, he did provide proof that he sent ACT the $1,000.00 deposit. As\n\n5\nto the other two debts, he stated he is trying to make contact with the creditors. Overall,\nhis efforts evince a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his debts.\nAccordingly, this mitigating condition applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false,\nmaterial information on an EQNSP.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations. In addition, he lied to the Government\nin January 2006 when he, in essence, denied any delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s inability\nor unwillingness to honor his financial obligations and to be truthful about them is\n\n6\nserious and recent. His failure to explain why he did not honor his financial obligations,\nand his incredible denial of an intent to deceive the Government about his financial\ncondition, preclude a finding that applicant\u2019s financial difficulties will not recur and that\napplicant is unlikely to provide false information to the Government in the future. Based\non the foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising\nfrom Guidelines E and F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance is denied.\nOn June 2, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance for his employment\nwith a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On November 9, 2007, DOHA issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),  which specified the basis for its decision \u2013\n2\nsecurity concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial\nApril 10, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n In accordance with Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 -\n4\n8) proffered in support of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nconsiderations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).  More specifically, the\n3\ngovernment alleged that Applicant owed $16,193 for seven delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a - 1.g). On January 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, admitted with\nexplanation all but one (SOR \u00b6 1.c) of the allegations therein, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing.\nOn January 24, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n4\nreceived the FORM on January 20, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a response to\nthe FORM. He submitted nothing before the deadline, and the case was assigned to me\non April 7, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s attachments to his response to the SOR,\nand the government\u2019s FORM and the exhibits therein, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 39 years old and has been employed since December 2004 as a\ntechnical technician for a defense contractor. He and his wife have been married since\nNovember 1995. (FORM, Item 6)\nBetween April and July 2004, Applicant accrued $942 in delinquent debt for four\nunpaid medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d), an unpaid satellite television account (SOR \u00b6\n1.e) and an unpaid cell phone account (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (FORM, Item 7) The information he\nsubmitted with his response to the SOR showed the following:\n- The debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c was paid as required and is reported in error on\nApplicant\u2019s credit report.\n- Applicant paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e in September 2006.\n- Applicant paid the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d and 1.f in November\n2007.\nIn December 2000, Applicant co-signed a car loan with his wife for a 2001 Nissan\nPathfinder. The car was repossessed for non-payment of the loan on November 2,\n2004. The car was re-sold on or about 10 days after the repossession. Since then,\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n3\nApplicant has been obligated to pay $15,251 as the difference between the resale and\nthe amount remaining on the loan. He has not repaid this debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In response\nto the SOR, he submitted an excerpt from his credit report on which he had circled the\nreference to the fact the debt had been charged off as a business loss. He appears to\nbe claiming this means he is no longer responsible for the debt.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient reliable information to support the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g that Applicant owed seven delinquent debts totaling\n$16,193. The debts went unpaid for more than three years. These facts support\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant showed the debt listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is invalid and that he has paid the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d - 1.f.\nThe one remaining debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g constitutes 95% of the debt alleged. Applicant\nappears to rely on the fact the debt has been charged off as justification for not paying\nthe debt. He also draws attention to the fact he co-signed the loan for his wife to imply\nhe should not be held accountable for the debt. Whereas the presence of unpaid debt is\nnot per se disqualifying, the burden is on Applicant to show why the government should\nnot be concerned by his failure to pay his debts. While it is laudable that he has paid or\nresolved the other debts, his payments were made after he was issued the SOR and\ncannot be considered as being made in good faith. Nor does the information Applicant\npresented regarding SOR \u00b6 1.g justify his apparent inaction. Further, he has presented\nno information about his income and expenses that would provide a more\ncomprehensive picture of how the repossession debt may or may not impact his overall\nfinances. \nAs to SOR  \u00b6 1.c, the mitigating condition listed in AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) applies. However, there is no basis\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n5\nfor application of any of the remaining mitigating conditions. On balance, Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 39 years old, has\nbeen married to the same person since 1995, and must be presumed to be a mature\nadult. However, there is no available information about his current finances, the reasons\nhe did not pay the listed debts in the first place, or why he will not incur delinquencies in\nthe future. Finally, there is no information in the record about his work performance,\nreliability, judgment or other facets of his life relevant to a suitability determination. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all of the information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances\n9\nshows there are still doubts about his ability to protect the government\u2019s interests as his\nown. Because the protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, these doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the one allegation under paragraph 1 (criminal conduct). Applicant is single, 26 years old, and employed by a defense contractor as a software developer/systems analyst. He seeks a security clearance. On September 26, 2004, Applicant (age 22) was arrested and charged with (1) Rape, Unconscious Victim (Felony 1), (2) INDSI Person Unconscious (Felony 1), (3) 1 Sexual Assault (Felony 2), (4) Aggravated Indecent Assault (Felony 2), and (5) Indecent Assault, Person Unconscious (Misdemeanor 2). On January 18, 2006, he pled guilty to 2 the fifth count, and the other four were dismissed. On January 26, 2006, Applicant was sentenced to two years probation, 72 hours of incarceration, a fine, and nine months of house arrest. The sentence was amended on January 30, 2006 by ordering Applicant to pay restitution of $806.00 to the victim or the victim\u2019s compensation program, or both. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denies a judgment was entered against him for nonpayment of the court fine. Applicant provided no evidence in support of his claim.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on February 17,\n2007. On November 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the criminal\nconduct guideline (Guideline J). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his notarized answer to the SOR on November 29, 2007. He\nelected to have his case decided administratively without a hearing. A copy of the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on December 27, 2007. Applicant received the FORM\non January 02, 2008. Applicant\u2019s response was due by February 1, 2008. No response\nwas received. The case was assigned to this administrative judge on March 13, 2008.\nMarch 31, 2008\n\n The acronym is defined in the Pennsylvania Penal Code as \u201cinvoluntary deviate sexual intercourse.\u201d \n1\n The allegation appears in subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR.\n2\n2\nBased upon a review of the FORM and the entire case file, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the one allegation under paragraph 1 (criminal conduct).\nApplicant is single, 26 years old, and employed by a defense contractor as a software\ndeveloper/systems analyst. He seeks a security clearance. \nOn September 26, 2004, Applicant (age 22) was arrested and charged with (1)\nRape, Unconscious Victim (Felony 1), (2) INDSI  Person Unconscious (Felony 1), (3)\n1\nSexual Assault (Felony 2), (4) Aggravated Indecent Assault (Felony 2), and (5) Indecent\nAssault, Person Unconscious (Misdemeanor 2).  On January 18, 2006, he pled guilty to\n2\nthe fifth count, and the other four were dismissed. On January 26, 2006, Applicant was\nsentenced to two years probation, 72 hours of incarceration, a fine, and nine months of\nhouse arrest. The sentence was amended on January 30, 2006 by ordering Applicant to\npay restitution of $806.00 to the victim or the victim\u2019s compensation program, or both. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denies a judgment was entered against him\nfor nonpayment of the court fine. Applicant provided no evidence in support of his claim.\nAccording to an interview Applicant had with an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) on May 31, 2007 (Item 7), he invited the victim to his\nuniversity apartment for a weekend. He has known her since he was 15 years old. He\ndated her for seven months before he entered the university in 2000. Further, she had\nvisited in 2001 for a weekend. \nShe arrived on Saturday evening at 6:00 P.M. During about a two-hour period at\nhis apartment, they had two or three shots of rum and vodka. At 9:00 P.M., they\ncontinued drinking at a bar until around midnight. Applicant did not believe the victim\nconsumed as much as he did at the bar, but he did not think her consumption level was\nfar behind. \nApplicant then took the victim to a friend\u2019s apartment where he consumed five\nshots of alcohol and she consumed one or two. Some time later, Applicant discovered\nthe victim and a male went into an adjoining room and locked the door. Applicant\nbecame angry, but did not want to do anything foolish. So, he left the friend\u2019s apartment.\nHe returned at 2:00 A.M. and took the victim back to his apartment. \nFrom about 2:30 A.M. to 4:30 A.M. Applicant and the victim kissed and fondled\neach other. No intercourse occurred. Applicant believed he and the victim were\nintoxicated, though he thought the victim was responsive and participatory in their\n\n Applicant disputes this part of the interview (Item 7, question 3) indicating the victim was naked when she\n3\nawoke. He claims instead, that when she awoke, her underwear was on the floor, but she had some outer\ngarments on her body. \n3\nsexual activities. Applicant removed the victim\u2019s clothes and took several photographs\nof her naked. \nThe victim awoke at around 6:30 A.M. When she discovered she was naked, she\nassumed she had engaged in sexual intercourse.  She left the apartment suddenly, and\n3\nby 12:30 P.M., had not returned. Applicant initiated a short search, but returned to his\napartment at about 1:00 P.M., where he was met by several state troopers. They\nexecuted a search warrant, and interviewed him. He was not arrested until two weeks\nlater.\nApplicant was charged with five offenses. He pled guilty to indecent assault, a\nmisdemeanor. Applicant recalled having three sessions with a psychologist who\ndetermined he was not a threat to society. Item 4 and Item 7 reflect Applicant\u2019s payment\nof restitution and applicable court fines. \nEven though given an opportunity to provide evidence regarding his criminal\nconduct, he provided none. Applicant also declined to provide character evidence about\nhis work experience or his lifestyle in the community. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare flexible rules of law that are applied in conjunction with the general policy factors of\nthe whole person concept.\nThe protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government places a high degree of trust and confidence\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include\nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nCriminal behavior casts doubts concerning a person\u2019s judgment and\ntrustworthiness.\nAnalysis\n30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability. By it\u2019s very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct on September 26, 2004 falls within criminal conduct\n(CC) disqualifying condition (DC) 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) On September 26, 2004, Applicant took advantage of an intoxicated,\nunconscious victim by committing sexual misconduct and/or other sexual acts. Though\nit is impossible to discern how the plea bargain culminated in all felony charges being\ndismissed, the most credible reason is that the prosecution may have concluded their\ncase was not as strong as originally estimated in the investigation. The fact that\nApplicant knew the victim since she was 15, and that he had been dating her for seven\nmonths before he entered college in 2000, and that she visited him under similar\ncircumstances in 2001, may have caused the prosecution to reassess the merits of their\ncase.\nHowever, after reviewing Applicant\u2019s interview in May 2007, the only blame\nApplicant admits is causing the victim to become very intoxicated. He claims the victim\nwas a willing participant throughout the whole escapade on September 26, 2004. His\nposition removes CC mitigating condition (MC) 32.a. (so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior occurred, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) from consideration. The crime took place less that four years ago,\nand Applicant was discharged from probation in June 2007. Applicant\u2019s minimization of\nthe offenses continues to cast doubt on his trustworthiness and judgment. CC 32.b. (the\nperson was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no\nlonger present in the person\u2019s life) does not apply.\n\n5\nCC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) only applies as far as restitution is concerned. There is\ndocumented basis to believe Applicant satisfied his restitution. (Item 4) The passage of\nmore than three years since the offense occurred cannot be considered in a vacuum.\nRather, Applicant was on probation during the period, aware that a violation of a term of\nprobation could mean reinstatement of the original charges. Though Applicant made\nrestitution, the record contains no indicators of remorse for his actions. There is no\nevidence of his job performance or lifestyle. The CC guideline is resolved against\nApplicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion under the CC guideline. The\nsame conclusion is reached even after the circumstances of this case are evaluated in\nthe context of the whole person. Rehabilitation begins with the person comprehending\nthe seriousness of their conduct. Toward that end, an applicant should adduce not only\nevidence of remorse, but also evidence of other behavioral adjustments that\ndemonstrate the conduct will not happen again. While Applicant admitted SOR 1.a., he\nsupplied no evidence showing contrition or his reputation at work or in the community.\nApplicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the CC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, the government\u2019s exhibits (Gx.),\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits (Ax.), and Applicant\u2019s testimony, his request for a security clearance\nis denied.\nOn August 30, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor, where he works as a security guard. After reviewing the results of\nthe ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation. On July 23, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n As reflected on his Answer to the SOR, Applicant initially requested a determination without a hearing.\n3\nHowever, co-workers advised him he should ask for a hearing. Department Counsel agreed to his request.\n(Tr. 8 - 10)\n As provided for by section E3.1.10, I excluded Gx. 4 and 5 because they did not meet the authentication\n4\nrequirements of Directive Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. (Tr. 28 - 33)\n Ax. A includes 31 pages of handwritten budget information Applicant brought to the hearing with him.\n5\nBecause they were original working documents of which Applicant had not made copies to leave with me, I\nallowed him to submit post-hearing the faxed copies along with other relevant information. (Tr. 34 - 40)\n2\n(SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was\n3\nassigned an administrative judge on October 2, 2008, but was transferred to me on\nOctober 15, 2008. I convened a hearing on November 18, 2008. The parties appeared\nas scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5) . Applicant appeared\n4\nand testified in his own behalf. I left the record open after the hearing to receive\nadditional relevant information. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on\nNovember 26, 2008. On December 1, 2008, I received a post-hearing submission,\nwhich is included in the record without objection as Ax. A.5\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $18,401\nfor four delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d); that he received approximately $10,000 for\ndamages from a car accident in 2002, but failed to use the money to satisfy his medical\ndebts (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that in 2005, he failed to use any of the $25,000 he received\nfrom the sale of a house he inherited to pay any of his delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 1.f).\nApplicant denied SOR 1.b, but admitted the remaining allegations. In addition to the\nfacts entered through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the following findings of\nrelevant fact. \nApplicant is 30 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor as a\nsecurity guard since May 2006. Applicant generally has been steadily employed since\n1999. (Gx. 1) He has done well in his current position and his supervisor recommends\nhim for a security clearance. (Ax. A)\nApplicant and his wife are currently separated. They were married in November\n2003. Applicant has sole custody of their three-year-old child but has not filed for\ndivorce due to the costs involved. Applicant\u2019s wife has worked outside the home for\nmost of their marriage, but has kept her finances separate from his. She has refused to\ncontribute to the household finances or to help repay Applicant\u2019s past due debts. At one\n\n3\npoint in the past year, Applicant had to obtain a loan to bring his utility bills current.\nApplicant also testified she has been unfaithful and that she does not seem interested in\nseeing her child. (Gx. 2; Tr. 52 - 53, 61, 66) \nIn June 2001, Applicant voluntarily turned in the vehicle he had bought several\nmonths before because he no longer could afford the monthly payments. He had\npreviously been in a single-car accident and his insurance covered the repairs.\nHowever, because his monthly premiums doubled after the accident, he was unable to\nkeep the vehicle. When he returned the vehicle, he completed paperwork that showed\nhe still owed $9,815 for the balance of the financing agreement. This debt was listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a. As of the hearing, he was to begin repaying this debt in December 2008 at a\nrate of $100 each month. (Ax. A; Gx. 2; Tr.42, 47 - 48, 78)\nIn December 2001, Applicant was riding in a friend\u2019s car when it was involved in\nan accident. Applicant sustained injuries which required hospitalization. He incurred two\ndebts for medical services of $938 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $5,962 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Not long after\nhe received the bills for his medical care, he received $10,000 from his friend\u2019s\ninsurance company. However, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, rather than pay his medical bills\nand try to pay down the deficiency owed, he used the money to help buy his wife a new\ntruck, pay for a vacation, and help his parents with some of their needs. Applicant was\njust trying to make his wife happy. (Gx. 2; Tr. 44)\nIn 2005, Applicant bought his wife a $2,000 ring on credit with the jewelry store.\nHe paid about $100 each month for about four months until his wife decided she wanted\na new car. He financed a car purchase for which he was obligated to pay about $390\neach month. He could not afford both and, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, defaulted on the\njewelry store account. (Gx. 2; Tr. 41)\nIn 2004, Applicant inherited his late grandfather\u2019s house, which he promptly sold.\nHe received about $25,000 from the sale. Aside from paying off the jewelry debt\ndiscussed above, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, he did not use these proceeds to satisfy any\nof his past due debts. Sometime after he sold the house, he was offered a chance to\nsettle his voluntary repossession debt for $2,500 rather than the nearly $10,000 he\nactually owed. He failed to take advantage of that offer. Instead, after he and his wife\ncould not get financing for a new home because of his debts, Applicant again\nacquiesced to his wife\u2019s wishes and let her use the money to pay for things they did not\nneed, such as a vacation. He also used some of the money to help his parents\nfinancially. (Ax. 2; Tr.  51 - 52)\nApplicant has begun to manage his finances better. He and his child moved into\na new less expensive residence with friends who have helped him learn how to budget\nhis money. He has a monthly budget in place that addresses his anticipated income and\nexpenses through January 2010. (Ax. A; Tr. 54 - 65) He has incurred no new\ndelinquencies, but as of the hearing he had not yet begun to pay any of the debts listed\nin the SOR. He has not approached his other creditors to pay or resolve his past due\nmedical debts. (Tr. 50 - 51)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n4\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,6\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n8\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n5\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.9\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6 1. Available information also shows Applicant accrued approximately $18,401\nfor four delinquent debts between 2001 and 2005. I found credible his assertion that he\nhas paid the jewelry debt alleged in SOR 1.b. However, it is clear he has not yet paid,\nresolved, or addressed in a meaningful way the debts he owes for his repossessed car\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) or his medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). Further, on two separate\noccasions, he received large sums of money that would have resolved all of his debt.\nHowever, he chose on both occasions to spend his money in other ways. Ironically, if\nApplicant had resolved his debts, he and his wife may have qualified for a home in\n2005. Applicant has acknowledged he did not exercise good judgment about his\nfinances while he and his wife were together. The record in this case requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts), at AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt) and at AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant has shown that the car repossession alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a\narose due to his accident and subsequent insurance premium increase. It reflects well\non his judgment that he returned the vehicle rather than continue to miss payments.\nAdditionally, Applicant contends his now-estranged wife exercised a great deal of\ninfluence over their finances, which resulted in poor decision-making about their\nfinances when he received the proceeds from the sale of his grandfather\u2019s house.\nAccordingly, he is entitled to some benefit from the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b)\n(the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) However, this mitigation is limited by the fact that he was not yet\nmarried when he mis-spent his first windfall in 2001.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n10\n See footnote 7, supra. \n11\n6\nAdditionally, he established that his personal circumstances have changed so\nthat his wife no longer is involved in his finances and he has improved his ability to\nmanage his personal finances. The budget he presented, while rudimentary and based\non the assumption he will keep working in his current job, effectively projects a positive\nmonthly cash flow averaging $200 while paying at least $2,700 on the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt.\nThis information demonstrates that Applicant, now free of his wife\u2019s influence, is making\nsound financial decisions, is living within his means, and is intent on satisfying his past\ndue debts. Accordingly, available information requires consideration of the mitigating\nconditions at AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 20(c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). However, this\nmitigation is also limited by the fact the information he has presented represents future\nintentions and Applicant has not yet established a track record of financial solvency\nsufficient to overcome his past financial circumstances. On balance, I conclude he has\nfailed to overcome the security concerns established by the government\u2019s information.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 30 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. However, since at least 2001 he has demonstrated poor\njudgment about his finances. It is extremely rare that someone is presented, not just\none, but two clear opportunities to resolve their debts as was the case here. It may be\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife made it difficult for Applicant to use the $25,000 more wisely in\n2005. However, Applicant had already shown poor judgment in such a situation even\nbefore he met his wife. Despite the fact he now appears to be on the right track\nfinancially, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will continue to exercise sound judgment\nabout his money that would reflect well on his suitability for access to classified\ninformation. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information shows\n10\nApplicant has not satisfied the doubts about his suitability for access to classified\ninformation that are established by the results of the government\u2019s investigation.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.11\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n Subparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n Subparagraph 1.c - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \nJuly 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 25, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR on the same day, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nDOHA received the request on October 29, 2007. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on November 28, 2007. The case was assigned to me on December 3, 2007. \nOn December 14, 2007, I submitted a request to the hearing office requesting the case \nbe scheduled on January 23, 2008. On December 21, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the case to be heard on January 23, 2008. The hearing was held as \nscheduled.  \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 29, 2008. I held the record open until January \n30, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional material. The \nApplicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were received \nwithout objection.   \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) contained in Exs. \nI(A) through XV. Applicant objected to my consideration to the documents pertaining to \nSudan and the UAE on the grounds of relevance. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and \ntook administrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel. Tr. 12-15, \n17. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  \n \nThe most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to \nnotice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, \nAdministrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice). Various facts pertaining to Sudan and the UAE were derived from \nExs. I(A) through X as indicated under subheading \u201cSudan\u201d and \u201cUnited Arab Emirates\u201d \nof this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the \nSOR, except SOR \u00b6 1.b., which he denied. After a review of the evidence, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old Arabic linguist, who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2005. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance \nand seeks a clearance to enhance his position within his company.

Applicant and his wife \nhave two U.S. born sons, ages 19 and 16. Tr. 48-49, GE 2. \n \nApplicant has three siblings, a 46-year-old sister, a 44-year-old sister, and a 35-\nyear-old sister. His two oldest sisters were born in the U.S., and like Applicant are U.S. \ncitizens by birth. They have resided continuously in the U.S. since 1997. His youngest \nsister was born in Kuwait, is a citizen of Sudan, and formerly resided in the UAE. She \nrecently immigrated to the U.S. in November 2007 and holds permanent resident alien \nstatus. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) Tr. 17, 50-54.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are divorced.

Applicant\u2019s stated his mother-in-law was married \u201cfive \nor six times\u201d and \u201cwas a housewife basically.\u201d Tr. 30. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a \ncitizen and resident of Sudan. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) Applicant\u2019s last spoke to his father-in-law in \n1986. Tr. 18. Applicant\u2019s wife is an illegitimate child and his father-in-law \u201cnever did \nagree to be her father.\u201d Tr. 26, GE 3. Applicant described the relationship with his \nfather-in-law as, \u201c[t]here is no relationship.\u201d Tr. 26. \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepmother is his father\u2019s second wife. She like his father is a citizen \nand resident of Sudan. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) Applicant met his stepmother in \u201c1996 or 1995.\u201d He \nstated, \u201cI don\u2019t even know her last name. All I know is my father remarried a woman \nwho is younger than my younger sister, so that\u2019s all l know.\u201d Tr. 18. Applicant stated he \nhas no relationship with his stepmother, adding \u201cshe\u2019s my father\u2019s wife, not my \nstepmom.\u201d Tr. 31, 56. He stated, \u201cBut my relationship with my father has been \ncomplicated for years. So that\u2019s \u2013 I mean he\u2019s married to a younger woman. That\u2019s \nirrelevant, period. But my relationship with my father, I mean we didn\u2019t \u2013 before I spoke \nto him in 2004 or 2005, I probably hadn\u2019t spoken to him from \u201988 until that time \nprobably.\u201d Tr. 24-25, 55. Applicant does not have his father\u2019s telephone number nor \ndoes he have a way of maintaining contact with him. Tr. 25-26. \n \nApplicant\u2019s former stepfather is a citizen and resident of Sudan. (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) He \nstated the last time he spoke to his former stepfather was in \u201c1995 or 1996. One of \nthose years.\u201d Tr. 32. He and his mother divorced \u201csometime probably in \u201988 or \u201989.\u201d Tr. \n32. Applicant has no idea what his former stepfather does for a living and has no \ncontact with him. Tr. 32, 54-55. \n \nApplicant resided in Sudan from October 1995 to August 1996. (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) \nApplicant described this time as a \u201cvacation\u201d where he spent time with his mother and \nsisters, who were residing there at the time. Tr. 22-23. In 1997, Applicant\u2019s mother and \ntwo older sisters moved to the U.S. where they have remained. Tr. 23. From September \n1996 to February 2000, Applicant resided in the United Arab Emirates. (SOR \u00b6 1.h.) \nDuring that time, Applicant was a sales manager for a private company that dealt in \nschool furniture, and school-related supplies. Tr. 32-33. Applicant returned to the U.S. in \nFebruary 2000, and has remained in the U.S. since that time.  \n \nThe Assistant Vice President Language Services (AVP) from Applicant\u2019s \ncompany testified on his behalf. The AVP retired from the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant \nColonel after serving 28 years of active duty. He holds a top secret clearance sensitive \ncompartmented information (TS/SCI) with several high level U.S. government \nintelligence agencies. He has been working for his current employer since he retired \nfrom the Army, approximately five years ago. Tr. 57, 61-62.  \n \nThe AVP is Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor and has observed him on a daily basis \nfor the past two years. Tr. 58-60. As a defense contractor employee, Applicant provides \nsupport to a government agency and was selected for his particular assignment \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbecause of his background knowledge of the Middle East, and specifically to provide \nanalysis of Sudan and Egypt and related areas. Applicant supervises six other linguists \nand the AVP considers him \u201ctotally trustworthy, honest to a fault.\u201d Tr. 60. The AVP also \nsupervises Applicant\u2019s wife and knows them both in a professional capacity. The AVP \nstated their company initially screens employees by performing credit and criminal \nbackground checks, leaving security clearance background checks to the respective \ngovernment agencies. Tr. 61, 64. The AVP is very well versed on security and the \nsecurity clearance process and provided the following testimony in response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s question, \u201cDo you have any concerns with [regard to Applicant \nhaving family members in Sudan]\u201d Tr. 63. \n \nNo, I don\u2019t. . . . [I]n my section we have about 90 linguists and language \nanalysts who work for us. And of the 90, probably 75 or 80 of them are \nnative born linguists. So, no, the fact that they have \u2013 that people have \nfamily overseas is not really an issue. . . . [of greater] concern is either \nproperty ownership overseas or a close relationship like for instance if \n[Applicant] supported his family overseas, which he doesn\u2019t. Or frequent \ntravel overseas \u2013 that would be more of an issue. But just the fact that a \nperson is from overseas having [a] security clearance is not an issue. Tr. \n63. \n \nThe AVP added: \n \nI wish I had 89 [Applicants], honestly. He\u2019s a self-starter. When he\u2019s given \na project to conduct analysis on, he does it to excruciating detail. When he \nfirst started \u2013 like he\u2019s on kind of the second phase of the projects that \nhe\u2019s worked for us on. When he started on the first project the government \ndidn\u2019t exactly know what they were looking for. They knew what they didn\u2019t \nwant but they really didn\u2019t know what they wanted. And that was kind of \nthe guidance that [Applicant] was given. We don\u2019t know what we want but \nwe\u2019ll know when we see it, so keep doing the analysis you\u2019re doing. And \nhe never gave up and he never \u2013 a lot of people would get a real bad \nattitude for something like that. You know not given strict guidance. . . . \nBut he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t give up at all. And he kept refining his searches \nand he kept refining his research techniques and then he discovered \nexactly the product that the government wanted. He has delivered some \nreally premier products to this particular customer \u2013 to [government \nagency] \u2013 that have provided great \u2013 that have been of great import to the \nUnited States intelligence community. Tr. 68. \n \nAfter September 11th , the government \u2013 the intelligence community as a \nwhole, and I was a military attach\u00e9 in [Middle Eastern country] when \nSeptember 11th happened \u2013 the intelligence community outside of military \nlinguists or attaches like myself didn\u2019t understand that there\u2019s a difference \nin a linguist and a speaker. And the United States government went out \nand hired taxi drivers and butchers \u2013 people working butcher stores \u2013 and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \ncandlestick makers, trying to make them linguists. But just because you \nspeak another language does not make you a linguist. So the demand for \nan Arabic speaker or the \u2013 Arabic speakers honestly are a dime a dozen \u2013 \nbut good Arabic linguists who can accurately take the Arabic and all the \nsyntax and all the hidden Koranic meaning \u2013 not hidden but difficult to \nunderstand Koranic meaning is very \u2013 they\u2019re becoming more and more \nscarce because a lot of them have been hired by the government, \nhonestly. . . . I\u2019ve had, in the five years, four and a half years I\u2019ve been \nthere, I\u2019ve probably had ten native Arabic linguists hired by the \ngovernment from our contracts. Tr. 70-71. \n \nThe AVP concluded stating that Applicant was recently selected as employee of \nthe quarter out of 600 defense sector employees. Tr.72. On the basis of his past two-\nyear relationship with Applicant, the AVP has no concerns about granting a security \nclearance to Applicant. Tr. 64, 77. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employee performance evaluations reflect the highest possible marks \nwith supporting write-ups. AE B through D. Applicant submitted a reference letter \nauthored by a senior U.S. government official/client that stated in part,  \n \n[We] would like to take this opportunity to express our great appreciation \nat the end of an extremely productive contract year with our organization. \nYour consistent, accurate, and timely responses to our requests and those \nof our customers has helped make our organization the leading responder \nto breaking developments in Sudan. Your skill in monitoring, processing, \nand providing feedback in a timely manner with extraordinary flexibility is \nmost appreciated. Your reports and translations from the Jihadists \nwebsites garner our customers\u2019 attention on a regular basis with high \nimpact. Your accurate, professional and timely offerings of opinions on \npolitical, military, and CT issues in the Horn of African and in particular on \nSudan is invaluable. AE E. \n \nApplicant and his wife exercise all rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship to \ninclude voting regularly. They are involved in their children\u2019s activities. Tr. 79-80. He has \nbeen a home owner since 2002. Tr. 33. He estimates his net worth to include his 401k, \nhome equity, and bank accounts to be $420,425. Tr. 34, AE A. Applicant also submitted \ntwo other awards to include Employee of the Quarter, 2nd Quarter of CY 2005, a \nLeadership Excellence Award, and two honorary society certificates. AE F through I. \n \nSudan1 \n \nIn February 1953, the United Kingdom and Egypt concluded an agreement that \nprovided for Sudanese self-government, with a transitional period toward independence. \nSudan achieved independence on January 1, 1956 under a provisional constitution. A \n \n1 The contents of the information contained in subheadings \u201cSudan\u201d and \u201cUnited Arab Emirates\u201d \nwere taken in whole or in part from Exs. I(A) through XV. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmutiny of army officers led to seventeen years of civil war (1955-1972). A peace \nagreement was reached in 1972, but civil war began again in January 1983 when \nsoldiers mutinied. Through the 1990s, there were a series of regional efforts to bring the \nSudanese civil war to an end. By mid-2001, prospects for peace in Sudan appeared to \nbe remote. On January 9, 2005, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, \nestablishing a new Government of National Unity and the interim Government of \nSouthern Sudan, and stipulating a six-year interim period to allow for implementation of \nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement and elections at all levels. Although some \nprogress was achieved, meaningful implementation of key provisions of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement has faltered. \n \nA rebellion in Darfur has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of persons in \nDarfur, and has led to an estimated 2 million internally displaced persons in Sudan and \n234,000 refugees in neighboring Chad. The Sudanese Government Ais complicit in the \nbombing, murder, and rape of innocent civilians@ in Darfur, and the Sudanese President \nhas demonstrated a Acontinued refusal to honor his commitments to end the violence in \nDarfur.@ \n \nIn August 1993, Sudan was designated by the Secretary of State as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. Although Sudan has Aaggressively pursued terrorist operations \ndirectly involving threats to U.S. interests and personnel in Sudan,@ it remains on the \nState Department list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. \n \nSudan is under a broad U.S. embargo, with extensive trade restrictions on \nexports and re-exports to Sudan. In 1997, President Clinton issued Executive Order \n13067, which declared that the polices and actions of the Government of Sudan \nAconstitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \npolicy of the United States.@ In 2006, President Bush issued Executive Order 13412, \nwhich cited Athe continuation of the threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States created by certain policies and actions of the Government of Sudan@ \nand reaffirmed and supplemented Executive Order 13067. \n \nThe Government of Sudan=s human rights record has Aremained poor, and there \nwere numerous serious problems,@ including: continuing genocide in Darfur; \nextrajudicial and other unlawful killings; torture, beatings, rape, and other cruel and \ninhumane treatment by security forces; arbitrary arrest and detention; executive \ninterference with the judiciary and denial of due process; infringement of citizens= rights \nto privacy; infringement of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, \nreligion, and movement; trafficking in persons; violence and discrimination against \nwomen and ethnic minorities; and forced labor. Although prohibited by the Interim \nNational Constitution, government security forces Acontinued to torture, beat, and \nharass political opponents and others.@ Even though it is prohibited by the Interim \nNational Constitution and law, Athe government continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain \nunder the National Security Act.@ Furthermore, A[a]lthough the law provides for access to \na lawyer, security forces often held persons, including criminal detainees, \nincommunicado for long periods in unknown locations without access to their lawyers or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfamily members.@ The government monitors Internet communications and the National \nIntelligence and Security Service (NISS) reads email messages between private \ncitizens. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State Acontinues to warn U.S. citizens against all travel \nto Sudan.@ The travel warning states: ATravelers are reminded that the U.S. Government \nhas received indications of terrorist threats aimed at American and western interests in \nSudan.  Terrorist actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or kidnappings.@ \n \nUnited Arab Emirates \n \nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), located in the Persian Gulf region, is a \nfederation of emirates, each with its own ruler.  The federal government is a \nconstitutional republic, headed by a president and council of ministers.  Islamic ideals \nand beliefs provide the conservative foundation of the country=s customs, laws and \npractices. Only 15-20% of the UAE=s population are UAE citizens. The remaining \npopulation includes significant numbers of other Arabs, including many Iranians. \n \nThe UAE contributes to the continued security of the Persian Gulf, and is a \nleading partner in the campaign against terrorism, providing military, diplomatic and \nfinancial assistance.  The United States has enjoyed friendly relations with the UAE \nsince their formation in 1971, and particularly since the 1990-91 Gulf War.  However, \ntwo of the 9/11 highjackers were UAE nationals and the UAE was one of only three \ncountries to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.  Dubai \nis also a key transfer point for illicit sales of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and North \nKorea. \n  \nTraditional rule in the UAE is generally patriarchal, with political allegiance \ndefined in terms of loyalty to tribal leaders. There are no democratically elected \nlegislative institutions or political parties, and no general elections. In 2006, the U.S. \nState Department found that the UAE government=s respect for human rights remained \nAproblematic,@ due to its lack of elections, arbitrary and incommunicado detentions, \nquestionable independence of the judiciary, and restrictions on civil liberties. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nsense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly  \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nIf the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk or foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). At a minimum, Applicant \nhas vicarious contact with his mother-in-law, vis-\u00e0-vis his wife, who lives in Sudan. His \nmother-in-law lived with him and his family in the U.S. for five years from 2001 to 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s wife maintains direct and frequent contact with her mother by telephone and \nsends her $300 to $500 a month. Applicant described his relationship with his mother-\nin-law as \u201cnormal.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence supports the notion he has no meaningful relationship with \nhis father, father-in-law, stepmother, and former stepfather, who all are citizens and \nresidents of Sudan. Since the SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s sister, who was living in the \nUAE, moved to the U.S. in 2007 as a permanent resident alien. Applicant also resided \nin Sudan for 11 months from October 1995 to August 1996, and resided in the UAE for \n3 \u00bd years from September 1996 to February 2000. Considering the facts as a whole, \nthe relationship Applicant has with his mother-in-law and his foreign travel create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother-in-law and his foreign \ntravel. However, the government\u2019s evidence did not establish that Applicant had similar \nrelationships or connections his father and relatives through marriage. The burden \nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. As previously \nindicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nTwo Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n\n \n12 \n \n \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nThe government\u2019s evidence established disqualifying conditions as it pertains to \nhis mother-in-law, and the following discussion is limited to her. AG \u00b6 8(a) partially \napplies. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is not associated with or connected with the \nSudanese government. His mother-in-law is elderly and in poor health. Applicant does \nenjoy a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship with his mother-in law, which is reasonable given the fact \nshe lived with him and his family for five years in the U.S. His wife enjoys a continuing \nand close relationship with her mother as evidenced by her frequent telephone calls and \nmonthly monetary support.  \n \nApplicant has no relationship with his father and former relatives by marriage. In \nthe case of his mother-in-law, Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of [his mother-in-law] and the \ninterests of the U.S.\u201d His relationship with his mother-in-law vis-\u00e0-vis his wife could \npotentially force him to choose or place him in a position to choose between the United \nStates and Sudan. On balance, he did not fully meet his burden of showing there is \n\u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his mother-in-law] could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Except for the times Applicant resided in the UAE and \nSudan, Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1983, a period of 25 years. Although he is \nsomewhat close to his mother-in-law, he has a much greater relationship with his family \nliving in the U.S. His wife has lived in the U.S. since 1987, a period of 21 years. She \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1995. Both of Applicant\u2019s sons, ages 19 and 16, \nare U.S. born citizens. He is completely vested in the U.S. His two sisters are U.S. born \ncitizens and live in the U.S. His mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and lives with the \nApplicant. His remaining sister recently immigrated to the U.S. in 2007 and is a \npermanent resident alien.  \n \nThe only immediate family member Applicant has in Sudan is his estranged \nfather. Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S., as he \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant \nhas been employed by his defense contractor employer since November 2005, and is \nvery highly regarded at work. Applicant\u2019s contacts and linkage to the U.S. are much \ngreater than his linkage to Sudan or the UAE. He is heavily vested in the U.S., \nfinancially and emotionally. \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d4 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.5 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Sudan and the UAE. Applicant was raised, in part, in Sudan, and has \nvarious immediate and non-immediate family members who are from Sudan. He spent \napproximately 11 months on vacation in Sudan from 1995 to 1996. He worked and \nresided in the UAE for 3 \u00bd years from 1996 to 2000. His sister, who recently immigrated \nto the U.S. is a Sudanese citizen. His wife has frequent, non-casual contact with her \nelderly and ailing mother, who lives in Sudan.   \n   \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant is a U.S. born citizen. After accompanying his father and family to \nvarious countries, he chose to return to the U.S. in 1983, attend college, and take up \npermanent residence. Except for his visit to Sudan and time spent in the UAE, he has \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n14 \n \n \n                                                          \nremained continuously in the U.S. After his Sudanese wife moved to the U.S. in 1987, \nshe chose to become a U.S. citizen, which she successfully attained in 1995. Applicant \nhas strong ties to the U.S. He and his wife have two U.S. born children. His mother is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen and lives with him and his family. Applicant has two U.S. born \nsisters, who reside in the U.S. and a third sister who was born in Sudan, who recently \nimmigrated to the U.S. Apart from his father, Applicant has no immediate family \nmembers living in any other country other than the U.S.   \n \nApplicant has no meaningful relationship with his father, who lives in Sudan. He \ndoes not communicate with him. He has no relationship with the other non-immediate \nrelatives in Sudan identified in the SOR. His father has remarried and started a new \nfamily apart from Applicant and his siblings. His mother-in-law is elderly and in poor \nhealth. None of his immediate or non-immediate family members overseas are in \npositions placing them as likely targets as a means to exploit Applicant. He has no \nfinancial ties overseas in contrast to his U.S. financial ties. There is no evidence he has \never taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States.   \n \nApplicant is a very successful Arabic linguist. His employer\u2019s confidence and trust \nin him is very high. Weighing very heavy in Applicant\u2019s favor was the credible and \npersuasive testimony provided by his AVP. His AVP has extensive training and \nexperience in security clearance matters, and has first-hand knowledge of Applicant\u2019s \nprofessional capabilities. The AVP provided evidence of Applicant\u2019s contribution, which \n\u201chave been of great import to the United States intelligence community.\u201d The \ngovernment agency client drafted a letter stating that Applicant\u2019s work product \u201chelped \nmake our organization the leading responder to breaking developments in Sudan.\u201d6 The \nAVP assesses Applicant as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, responsible, mature, and \nof high integrity. Based on the overall facts taking into account the contribution he has \nmade and will continue to make as an Arabic linguist, the AVP strongly recommended \nhim for a security clearance. The government did not produce any derogatory \ninformation about him nor did anyone come forward recommending denial of his \nsecurity clearance. \n \nAlthough the Government has no obligation to present evidence that Applicant \nand/or his family members are foreign agents, Applicant\u2019s family members are not, and \nnever have been, foreign agents. Sudan is not without its difficulties. The one relative \nApplicant is close to in Sudan is his mother-in-law, who is elderly with numerous health \nproblems. No evidence was presented suggesting the Sudanese government has used \nits resident citizens to extract information from U.S. relatives. The likelihood of such an \noccurrence appears remote. Applicant has no connection with the UAE since his sister, \nwho was living there, immigrated to the U.S. last year.  \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \n \n6 See ISCR Case 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2007.) (emphasizing contribution Applicant has \nmade in the War on Terrorism). \n\n \n15 \n \n \n                                                          \nunder the facts presented that the Sudanese and UAE governments or its agents might \nexploit or attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way that \nthis U.S. citizen would have to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and \nthose family members.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.i.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.

Le\u2019i, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on January 25,\n2007. On March 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuidelines C and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nSeptember 23, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 3, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. In his answer he denied the one allegation under\nGuideline C (SOR \u00b6 1.a.),and denied the seven allegations in the SOR under Guideline\nB (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2. a.-g.). Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 12, 2008. I\nreceived the case assignment on June 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJune 20, 2008, for a hearing on July 25, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits (Exhs 1-4) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted four exhibits (Exhs. A-D)\nwhich were admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 24, 2008. The record was left open for ten\ndays and one additional document was submitted by Applicant and admitted into\nevidence without objection (Exh. E). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old civil engineer who works for an engineering services\ncompany that provides services for the U.S. government. He was born in the Philippines\nand emigrated to the U.S. to complete his education. He became a citizen in 2006. He\nreceived his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in the Philippines and received a PhD in\nthe U.S. from one of the leading engineering schools. \nApplicant\u2019s principal activity in his work is geo-structural engineering and his work\nhas involved the central artery (Big Dig) in Boston and research on tunnels in the Alps.\nHe does not hold a security clearance and now works on civilian construction projects\nfor his employer. His company has worked for the U.S. government, and they desire to\nuse him on those projects which require a clearance. He is motivated to work on\ngovernment projects because of his pride in his U.S. citizenship. \nBefore becoming a citizen he held a passport of the Philippines which did not\nexpire until March 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). He has destroyed the passport (Attachment to\nAnswer) and does not intend to apply for a new one. \nApplicant has one brother who is a citizen of and resides in the Philippines. He\nhas two sisters who are also Philippine citizens. One sister resides in Norway and the\nother one lived in the U.S. until 2007 and then returned to the Philippines. His mother-\nin-law is also a citizen of the Philippines but resides in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b.-d.). He\nand his siblings have a joint interest in a family home in the Philippines valued at\napproximately $250,000 (SOR \u00b6 2.e.).\nApplicant helped organize and design a plant for a company his wife and her\nbrother now own. Applicant organized the company in 2002 with some university\nclassmates to manufacture an environmental product for use in water and air\npurification. In August 2006 he sold his interest in the company to his wife (SOR \u00b6 2.g.).\nHe traveled to the Philippines in 2001, 2005, and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.f.) primarily in\nconnection with planning and construction of the plant which was completed in 2006. \n\n3\nIt is this allegation in the SOR relating to the company that the government\nexpressed the most concern about in the hearing since there was a possibility that\nApplicant\u2019s activities for the foreign company and his relatives continued interest in it\ncould create conflicts with the work he does for his employer in the U.S. The other\nallegations under Guideline B were alleged to show a context for this allegation since it\ninvolves a company in his country of origin (Tr. 7-8). His immediate supervisor, who is a\ntop company officer, knows of his past involvement with the company and his wife and\nbrother-in-law\u2019s continuing interest in it. The supervisory corporate officer concluded\nthat there is no likelihood of overlap or conflict between the work of his employer and\nthe Philippine company (Exh. E). From my analysis of the descriptive information\nsubmitted by Applicant (Tr. 63-65) and the corporate officer about both companies, I\nagree with the conclusion. \nApplicant has significant financial interests in the U.S. primarily in two homes in\ntwo states valued respectively at $400,000 and $200,000. He also owns a rental\nproperty valued at $150,000. He has a savings account of over $10,000. His annual\nsalary is $118,000. His wife works for a non-profit agency concerned with juveniles and\nis paid $40,000 per annum. They have two children ages 17 and 11. He is highly\nregarded by the officers of his company for his abilities, integrity, and competence\n(Exhs. A-C).\nThe government did not offer any documents for administrative notice in\nApplicant\u2019s hearing, relating to the Philippines, the country at issue, as is often done in\ncases involving either of the foreign guidelines (B and C). However, I take notice of the\nfact that it is well known that the Philippines has a democratically elected government\nand is a staunch ally of the United states. Historically, it was ceded to the U.S. after the\nSpanish American War in 1898 and became independent in 1946 after its occupation by\nthe Japanese in World War II. It has a history of support of U.S. interests in the Pacific\narea, and as an ally of the U.S. in various conflicts in the Far East. It has taken action\nagainst Muslim extremists on the southern island of Mindanao with the assistance of the\nU.S. military. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nlegal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all\nallegations set forth in the SOR: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG \u00b6 9: \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\n\n5\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes but is not limited to possession of a current foreign\npassport;\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns including that the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated. While he had a passport, it was acquired before he became a citizen and it\nhas been destroyed. I conclude that the security concern has been mitigated. \n         Guideline B, Foreign Influence\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nlegal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG\n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion\nby any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident in\na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion (AG \u00b6 7a). A second condition that could\nraise a security concern include a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a\n.....foreign owned or operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened\nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation (AG \u00b6 7e). \nBased on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of family\nmembers living abroad and his past work for a foreign company in which his wife and\nbrother-in-law have a financial interest, the Government established a basis for a security\nconcern over foreign influence. The Applicant had the burden to establish security\nsuitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification\n\n6\nand demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6\n8a).\nApplicant\u2019s relatives are from a country with long and solid ties to the U.S. with\nshared and common interests. His two siblings living in the Philippines present minimum\nsecurity concerns that are not of serious concern because of the nature of the\ngovernment of the Philippines and its historical connections with the U.S. The foreign\ncompany is now owned by his wife and brother-in-law and he has no continuing\ninvolvement with it. The business is not similar to, or in any way in conflict with the\nservices his employer provides. This has been confirmed by a senior officer of the\ncompany. I conclude that the allegations of foreign influence have been mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the potentially\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. The security concerns do not arise because of any misconduct by\nApplicant, but because family members have a financial interest in a foreign company and\ntwo others are citizens of and live in a foreign country which is the country of origin of\nApplicant. The above cited factors are not precisely relevant to this type of case. Of\nrelevance is his expressed strong feeling concerning his identity as an American citizen\nand where his loyalty and obligations belong. He is a well-motivated and well-educated\n\n7\nprofessional with strong ties to the United States (Tr. 69-70). I find his testimony credible.\nThere is no basis for denial of access to classified information.\n        Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from the allegations of foreign\npreference and foreign influence.\n             Formal Findings\n       Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n         Paragraph 1, Guideline C FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\n   Paragraph 2, Guideline B  FOR APPLICANT \n           Subparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted. \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n       Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn May 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under\nthe Directive that eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a trustworthiness determination should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 19, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nSeptember 18, 2008.  A hearing was held on September 18, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.  At\nhearing, the Government's case consisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on one\nOctober 27, 2008\n\n2\nwitness (herself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on September 25,\n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,. pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of addressing her listed debts.  For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  The Government was\ngranted seven days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the\nrecord with her documented entry into a credit counseling program and payment of the\nrequired up-front fees to the counseling firm. Her post-hearing exhibit was admitted and\nconsidered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in April 2001 (discharged in July 2001) and (b) accumulated 27 debts\nexceeding $32,000.00. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified her security clearance\napplication (SF-85P) by understating her debts over 180 days delinquent when\nresponding to question 20 of the questionnaire. \nFor her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted her bankruptcy petition and\ndischarge, most of the listed debts, and her omissions.  She denied the allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs 1.e, 1.I, 1.p, 1.t, 1.x, and 1.y.  Applicant provided no\nexplanations for her answers.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old intake representative for a defense contractor who\nseeks a trustworthiness determination. The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant married in December 1995.  She has two children from this marriage:\nages 12 and 8 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 32).  She has permanent custody over both of her\nchildren who reside with her.\nApplicant was involved in an auto accident in 1996 that required a lengthy period\ndisability (R.T., at 44).  With little income from H to help her with household expenses\nwhile she was on disability, Applicant could not keep up with her bills (R.T., at 44).  \nApplicant first separated from her husband (H) in April 2002 and remained\nseparated for about two years (R.T., at 61).  She reconciled with H in September 2003\n\n3\nfor a brief two-month period before permanently separating in November 2003 (R.T., at\n94-95).\nApplicant petitioned for divorce from H in February 2004, and received her final\ndivorce decree in March 2006 (R.T., at 29).  H is currently on medical disability as a\nresult of an incident in which caused him post traumatic syndrome (R.T., at 30).  He\npays no child support and provides no financial assistance (R.T., at 32).  \nDuring their marriage, Applicant and H accumulated a number of marital\nobligations. With no financial help from H following their divorce, she fell behind on\nthese marital debts and defaulted.  Still unable to resolve these debts in 2001, she\npetitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2001 (R.T., at 43).  The unsecured debts\nshe scheduled in her bankruptcy petition exceeded $15,000.00 (R.T., at 43).  With\nvirtually no assets to cover these debts, her bankruptcy petition became essentially a\nno-asset case.  She received her bankruptcy discharge in July 2001.\nFollowing her bankruptcy discharge, Applicant continued to struggle with her\ndebts.  She accumulated a number of debts between July 2001 and April 2008 that she\ncould not resolve with her limited resources and little support from H during their\nmarriage. Applicant\u2019s listed delinquent debts (27 in all) exceed $32,000.00.  Some are\nconsumer-related and several involve traffic-related fines (R.T., at 49-50, 71-73). Her\nconsumer debts for the most part were jointly initiated during her marriage to H (R.T., at\n37).\nOne of Applicant\u2019s major listed debts represents a judgment taken against\nApplicant and H for two months of back rent (totaling $4,527.00) on an apartment she\nand her husband rented before their separation (R.T., at 76-77, 96-97).  Her marriage\nwith H in trouble, Applicant moved out of the apartment with her children in April 2002.\nH, in turn, stayed behind in the apartment unit for several months before he, too,\nvacated the premises (R.T., at 56-59).  Applicant acknowledged all but a few of the\nlisted debts that she attributes either to H or an unknown party (i.e., creditors 1.c, 1.I (a\nlikely duplicate of 1.h), 1.p, 1.t, 1.x, and 1.y).  \nFollowing her separation from H, Applicant was involved in a car accident (in\n2005) that prevented her from working for a period of time (R.T., at 31).  She struggled\nthereafter to keep up with her bills with her limited income sources, and fell further\nbehind with her debts without any assistance from H.   \nConcerned about her unresolved old debts, Applicant initially tried contacting  her\nold creditors individually (R.T., at 65).  She had no success contacting them, and turned\nto a credit counseling firm in 2007 for advice on how to address her delinquent debts\n(R.T., at 26-28). Before signing up with this debt management firm, though, she\nchecked on their business standing with her state\u2019s better business bureau (R.T., at 90-\n91).  She assures she is able to meet her current monthly debts for necessities with her\n$1,900.00 of net monthly income (R.T., at 41-42), and can handle monthly payments up\nto $250.00 (R.T., at 28, 89-93).  Afforded an opportunity to supplement the record, she\n\n4\ndocumented her executed agreement with the debt management firm she\ncommunicated with, her start-up payment to the firm, and a sample letter to credit\nreporting agencies (see ex. A).  Under the payment terms that Applicant arranged with\nthis firm, she will make monthly payments of $200.00.  With these funds, the debt\nmanagement firm will make pro rata payments to the creditors scheduled by Applicant\n(ex. A) under a four-year payment plan (R.T., at 46-47).\nAsked to complete an SF-85P application for a public trust position in September\n2006, Applicant understated her delinquent debts (listing only a 2004 unpaid traffic fine)\nwhen answering question 20 (see ex. 1).  Applicant assured she was only aware of\ntraffic debt when she answered question 20 (R.T., at 35, 99-102), and had never pulled\na credit report on herself (R.T., at 35).  Applicant did not intend to omit any delinquent\ndebts from her questionnaire (R.T., at 35-36, 102).  She admitted to falsifying her SF-\n85P in the mistaken belief at the time she executed the questionnaire she had no debts\nover 180 days delinquent (R.T., at 103).  In hindsight after seeing her credit report she\nrealizes she should have listed these other debts as well.  It was never her intent to\nfalsify her application or acknowledge any kind of deliberate falsification of her SF-85P\n(R.T., at 103-05) when responding to the SOR.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s negative answers to question 20 of hers SF-85P do not reflect\nany mention of possible delinquent debts (enforceable or otherwise) either in the\nquestion blocs themselves, or in the space for additional comments in question 43, her\ndemonstrated overall honesty and voluntary acknowledgments of her debt\ndelinquencies in her SF-85P, in her SOR responses, and in her hearing testimony,\nenable her on balance to avert any inferences of knowing and willful omission.  Given\nthe age of the debts at the time she completed the her SF-85P, and likely collection bar\nof the debts in question under her state\u2019s controlling statute of limitations, her omissions\nhave plausibility, and under all of the circumstances considered are accepted. \nApplicant assures she has received good performance appraisals and has\nreceived promotions from her employer (R.T., at 33).  She claims to be well regarded by\nher employer and is considered reliable and trustworthy.  She has never been cited for\nany privacy infractions by her employer and never do anything that could adversely\nimpact her standing with her employer. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\n\n5\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\n\n6\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an intake representative for a defense contractor who accumulated\nnumerous debts during periods of medical disability and divorce that imposed added\npressures on her fragile finances and parental responsibilities. With the limited\nresources available to her, she has been able to keep up with her current household\nexpenses and debts, but not much more.  While she has heard nothing from her old\ncreditors in many years and is not the subject of any known collection action on her\ndebts, she remains committed to repaying her old debts and has engaged a credit\nmanagement firm to help her to address her debts.  Applicant\u2019s finances and debt\nomissions in her completed SF-85P raise initial security concerns as well.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended\nthat he or she is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts, which heretofore she has not been in a position to\naddress, warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s debts covered in her\ndischarged 2001 bankruptcy,  and in the ensuing years following her separation and\ndivorce, and medically-related disability associated with her accident   Due to  prolonged\nperiods of income shortages caused by a host of contributing factors (lack of financial\nsupport from her husband during and after their marriage, significant parenting\nresponsibilities, disability caused by a 2006 traffic accident, and low-paying wages from\nher current employment, Applicant has not been in a position to make any tangible\nheadway with any of her debts (disputed or otherwise).  MC \u00b6 20(b) of the financial\nconsiderations guideline  (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibility) has some applicability to Applicant\u2019 situation.\n\n7\nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant since her separation/divorce\nand second accident, she has not heretofore been in a position to address her old debts\n(disputed or otherwise).  Most of Applicant\u2019s listed debts (exclusive of her judgment\ndebt) appear to have been placed in collection before 2004, and are likely barred by her\nstate\u2019s controlling statute of limitations. None of Applicant\u2019s listed medical and consumer\ndebts reflect any collection action by the individual creditors involved.   Based on this\nrecord, most of Applicant\u2019s covered debts appear to be barred from collection by the\npertinent four-year statute of limitation in Applicant\u2019s state for written agreements. \nStatutes of limitation, while considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, have never been\nequated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nJune 2001).   Still, they provide effective collection barriers and, like bankruptcy, serve\nto insulate the debtor from pressures to raise cash to  satisfy his or her creditors.\nTo be sure, Applicant does not assert relevant statutes of limitation in her state in\nher defense, and has committed to repaying her debts through a debt management firm.,\na commendable step considering that most of her debts are likely time-barred.  With her\nlimited income she has had past difficulty making individual or collective progress (such\nas use of debt consolidation) on her listed debts.  She has since completed a debt\nmanagement agreement, received limited financial counseling, and tendered the\nrequired $250.00 start-up fee to the debt management firm she enlisted. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s recent but important first repayment steps, two additional\nmitigating conditions have some application to Applicant\u2019s situation: MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe\nindividual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d   Based on Applicant\u2019s credible disputes of several of the listed claims (possibly\nH\u2019s debts incurred after their legal separation), MC 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d has some applicability as well relative\nto the listed creditors she disputes. \nHolding a favorable trustworthiness determination involves the exercise of\nimportant fiducial responsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and\ncandor.   Financial stability in a person cleared to access information covered by privacy\nrights is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the\ntrustworthiness determination. \nBoth the applicable mitigating conditions of the financial guideline and whole\nperson assessment of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and special circumstances as a\nstruggling parent who is addressing her old debts (despite available time bars for most of\nthe listed debts) conduce to dispel concerns about her reliability and trustworthiness.  \n\n8\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources she has had to address them with,\nand the debt management services she has enlisted to address her debts, she mitigates\ntrustworthiness concerns related to her debts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by the financial considerations guideline.\nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Appellant\u2019s SF-85P \nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nraised under personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of her omissions of her debts\nin the SF-85P she completed in September 2006.  By omitting her debts over 180 days\ndelinquent, Applicant failed to furnish materially important background information about\nher debts that was needed for the Government to properly process and evaluate his\nsecurity clearance application. With the core policy concerns of the personal conduct\nguideline (AG \u00b615) being questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, initial security concerns are evident\nunder this guideline.\nOn the strength of her omissions alone, DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.  While Applicant\ncannot fully explain her understated debts, she probatively demonstrated that she did not\ndeliberately omit her debts when she responded affirmatively to question 20 of the SF-\n85P.  MP \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability,\u201d is fully applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s omission explanations are persuasive enough to warrant\nconclusions the falsification allegations relative to her SF-85P omissions of her\ndelinquent debts are unsubstantiated.  Considering all of the evidence produced in this\nrecord, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the Guideline E allegations that\nApplicant knowingly and wilfully omitted her SF-85P debts more than 180 days,\ndelinquent.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.bb:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT \nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public\ntrust position.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted. \n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines B (Foreign Influence) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 13, 2008.  He supplemented \nthat Answer on March 19, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on March 24, 2008. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on April 17, 2008.  Another administrative judge received the case \nassignment on April 22, 2008.  DOHA reassigned the case to me on June 3, 2008, \nOctober 7, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nbased on caseloads. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 10, 2007, setting the \nhearing for July 3, 2008.  It was continued until July 21, 2008, and an Amended Notice \nof Hearing was sent June 26, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 21, \n2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified, and had no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on July 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel disclosed he would not submit any evidence on the \nGuideline E allegation and was withdrawing it from consideration.  Applicant had no \nobjection to the withdrawal of the allegation, and I granted the motion to withdraw. (Tr. \n7) \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq (Tr. at 10-12.) The request and the attached documents \nwere admitted into evidence as Exhibit 4. (Tr. 16) The facts administratively noticed are \nset out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer and the supplemental Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in Paragraph 1 of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided \nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 45 years old, married and the parent of three children (18, 14, and 13 \nyears of age).  Applicant was born in Iraq, served in the Iraq Army from 1985 to 1991, \nas he was required to do under Iraq law at that time, and immigrated in 1992 as a \nrefugee from the Saddam Hussein regime, the previous Iraqi government.  Applicant \ntraveled with his wife and daughter from Iraq to Turkey.  He remained there for seven \nmonths, and then was able to come to the United States. His oldest child was born in \nIraq, and is now a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Applicant and his wife also became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in 1999.  His younger two children were born in the United \nStates.  Applicant owns his house, and has no assets of any type outside the United \nStates.  He and his wife are employed in the United States.  At times, Applicant worked \ntwo jobs while his wife remained at home to care for their children.  Applicant currently \nmakes $14 an hour as a machine operator, and his wife is a store cashier. (Tr. 23, 28-\n32, 34-38, 62, 63; Exhibits 1 and 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father died in 1991.  His mother, an Iraqi citizen, lives in northern Iraq, \nand is 72 years old. His parents had eight children, all born in Iraq.  One sister died in a \n\n \n3 \n \n \nterrorist car bombing, one brother lives in the United States, three brothers live in \nnorthern Iraq, one brother immigrated to Turkey in 2008, and one sister also lives in \nnorthern Iraq.  Applicant\u2019s family is ethnic Assyrian and Christian in a Muslim country.  \nApplicant spoke with his mother in April 2008 after his surgery.  Previously, he spoke \nwith her in December 2007.  One brother who is disabled lives with his mother, and \nApplicant speaks with him about every six months.  The brother, who immigrated to the \nUnited States, has a \u201cgreen card\u201d as a resident alien. He works in Iraq as a translator for \nthe U.S. forces..   His oldest sister works as a secretary for an oil company in Iraq and \nhas since 1972.  Applicant last saw her 18 years ago.  Another brother works as a \nwelder for an Iraqi oil company.  Applicant last saw him 18 years ago.  The third brother \nwho departed Iraq in March 2008 to live in Turkey has no contact with Applicant.  A \nfourth brother operates a coffee shop in Northern Iraq, and did some work in the past for \nthe Assyrian Democratic Movement (ADM), an Iraqi political party.  He does not work \nfor the party now, and is only a member.  He wants to immigrate to the United States.  \nApplicant last spoke with him in April 2008.  Applicant\u2019s father was arrested by the \nHussein regime in 1985 because of his Assyrian ethnicity, and one brother also was \narrested in 1996 by the Hussein regime.  His four brothers served in the Iraqi Army as \nwas required under the Hussein government. (Tr. 40-53; Exhibits 1-3) \n \nApplicant fled Iraq in 1992 after helping the opponents of the Hussein regime.  As \na civilian in Iraq, Applicant was educated and worked as a pharmacy assistant. The \nHussein regime attempted to force all (about 500,000 people) Assyrians to become \nMuslims. He has not returned to Iraq since leaving it in 1992.  Applicant does not have a \nsecurity clearance, and has never had one in the United States.  He seeks a security \nclearance so that he can work as a translator for a Government contractor.  Applicant \nspeaks five languages, including English.  Applicant will keep secret U.S. classified \ninformation while working as a translator.  He testified credibly and persuasively that he \nwants to help the United States, because when he needed help the United States gave \nhim a place to live, citizenship, a steady income, and a home to own.  He also wants to \nhelp all the Iraqi people enjoy a democratic society and clean up Iraq from the Hussein \nregime.  He does not want to help only the Assyrian people who live in Iraq. (Tr.  29, 61-\n63, 71, 78) \n \n Applicant sent money, $100, in March 2005 to his brother because his brother \nneeded financial help at the time when the economy was poor in Iraq.  Applicant has not \ndonated money to the ADM.  The ADM chairman was a friend of Applicant\u2019s father in \nthe 1970s and 1980s. Applicant was not his friend, and had not met the ADM chairman.  \nApplicant was present at two public events this chairman attended in the United States \nin 2004 and 2005, along with hundreds or thousands of other people at those two \nfunctions. Applicant had no association with the ADM chairman at those events. \nApplicant voted in the January 2005 Iraqi election while in the United States, as allowed \nby the U.S. Government, to form the Iraqi Transitional Government.  In December 2005, \nhe voted in the legislative elections for the new Iraqi Parliament, casting his vote for the \nADM candidate. (Tr. 65-71; Exhibits 1-4) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Iraq is a Middle Eastern country \nwith 27 million people.  In 2003, The United States led a United Nations coalition to \nremove Saddam Hussein, a long-serving dictator, from power in Iraq. A parliamentary \ndemocracy was created pursuant to a new 2005 constitution. After free elections in \n2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office.  The Parliament was elected for a four year \nterm. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq had much violence, perpetrated \nby Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings had \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis.  \nAlthough the new governmental has taken aggressive action against terrorists, the \nthreat of terrorism in Iraq remains high, as do human rights abuses. Terrorist groups \nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.  For the past \n18 months, the large increase in U.S. combat troops in Iraq has substantially reduced \nviolence. These troops were aided by Iraqi soldiers, and Sunni local forces that formerly \nsupported the Al Qaeda insurrection.  In Northern Iraq, the Kurdish local government \nand forces maintain a more peaceful environment for the residents than elsewhere in \nIraq. (Exhibit 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n                                                          \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, one sister, and three brothers are citizens and residents of \nIraq. The other two brothers are citizens of Iraq, but do not live there. While Iraq \nstruggles with the creation of a democracy, it is randomly victimized by terrorist attacks. \nThis situation creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6 \n7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interests. In 1992, Applicant escaped from Iraq to avoid the Hussein \nregime, took his wife and child to Turkey and then to the United States.  He and they \nbecame naturalized citizens in 1999. His two sons were born in the United States in the \n1990s. He worked in the United States since his arrival, sometimes at two jobs, does \nnot own any property in Iraq, but owns a home and has his money in the United States. \nHe has not returned to Iraq since leaving it in 1992.  He has not seen some of his \nsiblings for 18 years.  Some, he speaks to intermittently by telephone.  He has not seen \nhis mother for some years.  Two of his brothers have also escaped from Iraq to live in \nthe United States and one is trying to immigrate here from Turkey.  His ties to the \nUnited States are much stronger than his ties to his siblings and elderly mother living in \nIraq. His strongly expressed gratitude to the United States for giving him \nshelter and a peaceful life with his family is very persuasive to show his \nstrong ties to the United States overcoming any residual attraction to his \nformer country. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has limited application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his siblings, \nwith whom he has infrequent communication, albeit he sent one of them $100 in 2005 \nbecause of the economic situation in Iraq. Although there is a remote possibility that \nterrorists could attempt to coerce or threaten Applicant through his siblings, it is highly \nunlikely.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even \nfriendly governments, could attempt to use his siblings and parent, who live in Iraq, to \nobtain such information. Second, he had numerous connections to Iraq before he \nimmigrated to the United States in 1991. He was born in Iraq and spent his formative \nyears there. He was educated in Iraq in the field of pharmacy. Third, his parent and four \nsiblings remain citizens and residents of Iraq. Fourth, he maintains some intermittent \ncontact with his mother. \n \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. Applicant is a mature person. He has lived in the United States for 16 years \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand been a naturalized citizen for nine years. His sons were born here. He owns a \nhouse here. Out of his sense of love and dedication to the United States, he wants to \nwork for a defense contractor as a linguist speaking five languages, including English.  \nThe other languages are very useful in the Middle East area. His brother, a U.S. \nresident alien, works as a translator for the U.S. forces in Iraq.  Applicant takes his \nloyalty to the United States very seriously. After leaving Iraq in 1992, he has not \nreturned. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause potential \nharm to the United States or would fail to abide by his employer\u2019s rules and regulations, \nor maintain necessary security of any classified information he might see as a \ntranslator. There is not any derogatory information about him concerning his work \nactivities in the United States.  Furthermore, his mother and siblings live in Northern \nIraq, the area under Kurdish control.  It is and has been more peaceful than other parts \nof Iraq.  The ADM is a political party with representatives in the Iraqi national parliament.  \nApplicant is not directly involved with the party, nor is his brother at the present time.  \nApplicant is not personally acquainted with any ADM politician serving in the Iraqi \ngovernment. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF-86) on June 29, 2006. On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nSeptember 22, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n  \n \nOn May 1, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that his \ncase be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 23, 2008. The FORM contained documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 5.  Additionally, the Government submitted with the FORM \nofficial U.S. government publications containing facts about Jordan and Israel. The \nGovernment requested that I take administrative notice of those facts in my decision in \nthis case. I marked the Government summary and accompanying documents as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) 1. By letter dated June 25, 2008, a copy of the FORM, including \nthe documents offered for administrative notice, was forwarded to Applicant, with \ninstructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of \nreceipt.  Applicant was provided with a complete copy of the FORM; he received the file \non June 30, 2008.  His response was due on July 30, 2008.  He failed to submit any \ninformation within the required time period. On September 15, 2008, the case was \nassigned to me for a decision.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains eight allegations which raise security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence, and two allegations which raise security concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations under \nGuidelines B and C.  His admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. \n   \n \n \nApplicant was born in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen. He also claims dual \ncitizenship with Jordan. He is unmarried and employed as an auditor by a government \ncontractor.  He seeks a security clearance.  (Item 3; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant resided in Israel from at least 1995 through August 2001.   From 1998 \nto 2001 he attended a high school in Israel, from which he graduated in 2001. He \nearned a degree in accounting from a U.S. university in 2005.  (Item 3; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are dual citizens of the U.S. and Jordan.  They \nreside in Israel.  Applicant\u2019s father is an officer in a family business located in part in \nIsrael.  His mother is employed as a secretary by the family business. Applicant\u2019s sister \nis a student at a university in Israel.  About once a month, Applicant has contact with his \nparents and sister by telephone. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandfather is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Jordan and \nresides in Israel, where he owns a business. Applicant\u2019s maternal grandmother is a \ncitizen of Jordan and also resides in Israel.  She is employed in her husband\u2019s business.  \nApplicant has contact with his maternal grandparents about once a year by telephone.  \n(Item 3; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant has four uncles.  One of Applicant\u2019s uncles is a dual citizen of the U.S. \nand Jordan and resides in Jordan. The uncle is the president of the family business \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nwhich employs Applicant\u2019s father and mother. Applicant has contact with his uncle in \nJordan twice a year by telephone. (Item 5.) \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s uncles are dual citizens of the U.S. and Jordan and reside in \nthe U.S. Two of the uncles own a U.S. business together. From April 2004 to June \n2006, Applicant was employed by these two uncles in their business. The third uncle is \nemployed by a U.S. university.  Applicant has contact with his three uncles who reside \nin the U.S. about three to four times per week.  (Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother and his paternal grandmother are also dual citizens of the \nU.S. and Jordan. They reside in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s brother is employed as an \ninformation technology consultant by a U.S. business. His paternal grandmother is \nunemployed. Applicant has daily contact with his brother and paternal grandmother.  \n(Item 5.)   \n \n \nApplicant does not own property in Jordan, Israel, or any other foreign country.  \nHe does not possess any foreign bank accounts.  He does not have any foreign \nbusiness or financial interests.  He does not receive support from his foreign national \nrelatives.  (Item 5.)    \n \n \nApplicant was issued a U.S. passport on November 2, 2000.  He maintains and \nuses a Jordanian passport when he travels to Jordan. He was issued a Jordanian \npassport in May 2004.   His Jordanian passport will expire in April 2009.  (Item 5.) \n \n \nWhile he considers himself to be a loyal U.S. citizen, Applicant exercises dual \ncitizenship with Jordan and is unwilling to renounce his Jordanian citizenship. He \nmaintains Jordanian citizenship because he expects someday to inherit property in \nJordan, and Jordanian citizenship is a condition for eligibility to inherit property in that \ncountry.  (Item 3; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Jordan and Israel in June 2002, December 2002, June \n2003, and March 2006.  He traveled to Jordan in August 2002 and December 2003.  \n(Item 3; Item 5.)     \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts offered by the Government and \nderived from official U.S. publications: \n \n \nJordan, a constitutional monarchy located in the Middle East, carries out a pro-\nWestern foreign policy that is helpful to the U.S.  Jordan\u2019s human rights practices, on \nthe other hand, include torture, arbitrary arrest, denial of due process, and restrictions \non freedom of speech, assembly, press, association, and movement. (HE 1: Summary) \n \n \nJordanian law applies to dual Jordanian-American citizens, and dual citizens are \ntreated as Jordanian citizens under the law. Jordan subjects male dual citizens under \nthe age of 37 to mandatory military service. (HE1: Summary) \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n  Even though Jordan has aggressively pursued terrorists, the threat of terrorism \ncarried out by transnational and local terrorist groups remains high in Jordan. These \nterrorists use overt, covert, and clandestine activities, including human espionage and \nother means, to exploit and undermine U.S. national security interests. In recent years, \nnumerous terrorist plots against U.S. interests have been interrupted by Jordanian \nsecurity forces. In November 2006, Jordanian officials intercepted a plot to assassinate \nPresident Bush when he visited Jordan.  (HE 1: Summary) \n \n \nIsrael, Jordan\u2019s neighbor in the Middle East, is a parliamentary democracy.  The \nU.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. Israel and the U.S. have a close relationship \nbased on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests.  Even \nso, the U.S. has concerns with some of Israel\u2019s policies, specifically Israel\u2019s sale of \nmilitary goods to China, Israel\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, and \ncertain cases of espionage involving compromise of proprietary or classified information \nwith military applications.  (HE 1: Summary.) \n \n \nIsrael is an active collector of U.S. proprietary information and targets private \nindustry and U.S. Government organizations.  (HE 1: Summary) \n \n \nThere is a continuing threat of terrorist attacks in Israel.  The U.S. Government \nhas urged Americans traveling in Israel to exercise a high degree of care when visiting \nplaces associated with U.S. interests or located near official U.S. buildings.  (HE 1: \nSummary)     \n \n  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n                                                \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts of Applicant\u2019s case raise security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 7(a), AG \u00b6 7(b), and AG \u00b6 7(i).1  \n \n \nUnited States interests are targeted by transnational and local terrorists operating \nin Jordan and Israel.  American citizens with immediate family members who are \ncitizens or residents of Jordan or Israel could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or \npressure. They could also be pressured by individuals or groups in Israel or Jordan \nseeking sensitive information or technology held by or developed by U.S. government \ncontractors. \n \n \nApplicant, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Jordan, resided in Israel during his \nadolescent years.  He attended high school in Israel. His father, mother, and sister are \ndual citizens of the U.S. and Jordan.  They currently reside in Israel, where the father \nand mother work in a family business and the sister is a student at an Israeli university.  \nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandfather is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Jordan and resides in \nIsrael with Applicant\u2019s material grandmother, who is a citizen of Jordan. Applicant\u2019s \nmaternal grandfather and grandmother carry out a separate business in Israel.  One of \nApplicant\u2019s four uncles is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Jordan and resides in Jordan. \nHe is the president of the business that employs Applicant\u2019s father and mother in Israel. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with family members residing and operating businesses in Jordan \nand Israel are multiple and diverse.  These facts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 \n(a) and 7(b).  \n \n \nIn addition, Applicant has close relations and frequent contact with his brother, \npaternal grandmother, and three uncles, all of whom are dual citizens of the U.S. and \nJordan and reside in the U.S. Applicant and his brother, who represent the third \ngeneration of the extended family, are both employed by U.S. businesses, the brother \nas an information technology consultant and Applicant as an auditor.  These facts also \nraise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \n \n \nApplicant maintains an active Jordanian passport. In June 2002, June 2003, \nJune 2003, and March 2006, Applicant traveled to Jordan and Israel.  He made \nseparate trips to Jordan in August 2002 and December 2003.  He uses his Jordanian \npassport when traveling to Jordan.  This raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 7(i) \nbecause, as a U.S. citizen, Applicant\u2019s reliance upon his Jordanian citizenship in these \n \n1 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(i) reads: \u201cconduct, especially \nwhile traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or \ncoercion by a foreign group, government, or country.\u201d \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \ncircumstances could make him vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign group, government, or country. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply.  If Applicant\u2019s \u201cforeign contacts and activities are on U.S. \nGovernment business or approved by the cognizant security authority,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his parents, siblings, grandparents, and uncles are \nneither casual nor infrequent. Instead, Applicant\u2019s relationships are based on long-\nstanding family ties of affection and obligation. Applicant is a dutiful son, brother, \ngrandson and nephew to relatives who are dual citizens of the U.S and Jordan who \nreside and conduct business in Jordan and Israel. Because transnational terrorism is a \nserious concern in those countries, and because there are also interests who may be \nseeking classified or protected information, Applicant\u2019s close relationships with family \nmembers in Jordan and Israel raise a heightened risk that he could be pressured to \nchoose between the interests of the foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.   \n \nApplicant maintains dual citizenship with Jordan so that he can be eligible to \ninherit property in Jordan in the future. This interest creates a conflict of interest in favor \nof Jordan. Applicant failed to provide documentary evidence to corroborate that he \nwould resolve any security-related conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with his family members who are dual citizens of the U.S. and Jordan and \nwho reside in Jordan and Israel could force him to choose between loyalty to his family \nand the security interests of the United States.  (ISCR Case No. 03-15485, at 4-6 (App. \nBd. June 2, 2005)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of his Jordanian passport to enter Jordan could make him \nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign group, government, or \ncountry.  He failed to provide documentation to show that he used his foreign passport \nwhile on official U.S. government business or that his use of a foreign passport was \napproved by his cognizant security authority.  I conclude that the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d) do not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States.\u201d  Such an individual \u201cmay be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  These disqualifying conditions are as follows: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;  \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. He expects to inherit property in Jordan at \nsome time in the future. As an adult, he actively sought dual citizenship with Jordan and \na Jordanian passport.  He did this in order to assert and maintain Jordanian citizenship \nso that he might comply with the inheritance laws of Jordan.  Additionally, he used his \nJordanian passport to enter Jordan. He refuses to renounce his Jordanian citizenship. \nThese actions show an allegiance to a country other than the U.S. \n \nI have carefully reviewed the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and the Foreign \nPreference AG. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct raises potentially disqualifying \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b610 (a)(1), \u00b610(a)(5), and AG \u00b610 (b). \n \nUnder AG \u00b611(a), dual citizenship might be mitigated if it is based solely on an \napplicant\u2019s parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Under AG \u00b6 11(b), an \nindividual\u2019s dual citizenship might be mitigated if he or she has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship.  Under AG \u00b611(c), an individual\u2019s exercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship might be mitigated if it occurred before \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.  Under AG \u00b611(d), an \nindividual\u2019s use of a foreign passport might be mitigated if it were approved by his \ncognizant security authority.  Under AG \u00b6 11(e), an individual\u2019s use of a foreign passport \nmight be mitigated if he presented credible evidence that the passport had been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nI conclude that none of the Guideline C mitigating conditions applies to the facts \nof Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. \nand Jordan. He has multiple family connections with persons living in Israel and Jordan.  \nThese family members are conducting business in those countries, where credible \nthreats of transnational and local terrorism exist amid efforts by individuals, groups, and \ngovernments to obtain U.S. protected and proprietary information. These relationships \ncould cause Applicant to be manipulated in a way to compromise U.S. security \ninterests. Additionally, Applicant, who is a native-born U.S. citizen, has actively sought \nJordanian citizenship and a Jordanian passport to protect an expected inheritance \navailable to him only if he is a Jordanian citizen.  His actions reveal a serious conflict of \ninterest which he cannot be expected to resolve in favor of the U.S.    \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate foreign influence and foreign preference \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                       \n \n \n \n \n________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Some of the e-mails were classified. This\nbehavior generates security concerns under Guidelines E, personal conduct, M, misuse\nof information technology systems, and K, handling protected information. Applicant\ndisclosed this adverse information to his current employer before beginning employment\nin October 2005. Since then, he has maintained a Top Secret clearance, and his on-the-\njob conduct and professionalism have been exemplary. Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity clearance concerns. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a security concern under Guidelines\nE, Personal Conduct, M, Misuse of Information Technology, and K, Handling Protected\nInformation. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nNovember 23, 2009\n\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 29, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept SOR \u00b6 1.c. The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2009. On August 12, 2009,\na notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for September 9, 2009. The hearing\nwas conducted as scheduled. I received 5 government exhibits, 10 Applicant exhibits,\nand the testimony of 4 Applicant witnesses. The transcript was received on October 17,\n2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old married man with three children ages 18, 13, and 12.\nHe is a veteran of the United States Army where he served from 1995, directly after\nfinishing high school, to 2003 when he was honorably discharged (Tr. 97). According to\nhis supervisor during his last two years in the Army, he \u201cdemonstrated excellent\nperformance in decision-making and pertinent information, and safeguard[ing] security\u201d\n(Tr. 51). After leaving the Army, Applicant entered college, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin computer systems in March 2008 (Tr. 99).\nShortly after leaving the military in 2003, Applicant began working for a defense\ncontractor as a network administrator on classified systems (Tr. 98). Among other\nthings, he managed the help desk. Also, when military clients were deployed abroad,\nApplicant was responsible for setting up their network systems at their respective duty\nstations (Tr. 123). In December 2004, Applicant held a part-time job with another\ndefense contractor where he performed similar work (Exhibit 4 at 11; Tr. 108).\nIn late 2004, Applicant began working on the computer network of a female\nenlisted military member who had recently deployed abroad (Tr. 152). He performed\nthis task through his primary employer. Although Applicant rarely saw the enlisted\nmilitary member, they became friends. When she returned to the U.S. in January 2005,\nthey became romantically involved (Tr. 122). Applicant did not tell her that he was\nmarried (Tr. 100). \nIn approximately April 2005, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend began to suspect he was\nmarried. After calling his home and speaking to his wife, she ended the relationship (Tr.\n29). Applicant has not spoken with his ex-girlfriend since then (Tr. 101).\nApplicant was concerned about his ex-girlfriend\u2019s well-being after their\nrelationship ended (Tr. 118). In May 2005, he began accessing her work e-mails \u201cto\nmake sure [she] was okay\u201d (Tr.118). His employer did not authorize him to read her e-\nmail, and she was unaware that he was accessing them (Exhibit 2 at 6). Some of the e-\nmails contained classified information (Answer at 1). Over the next three months,\n\n3\nApplicant accessed her e-mail approximately 25 times (Exhibit 2 at 6). At the time,\nApplicant held a Top Secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI) (Tr. 104). \nApplicant knew his conduct violated his company policies regarding the\nappropriate use of information systems (Tr. 105). Also, he knew that his conduct could\nresult in his dismissal, if discovered (Answer at 1; Tr. 127). \nUnbeknownst to Applicant, his ex-girlfriend had configured her e-mail to send\nelectronic receipts to confirm that individuals whom she e-mailed had read her\ncorrespondence (Id.). In approximately September 2003, she received a return receipt\nfrom Applicant\u2019s e-mail address for a message that she did not send him (Id.). She\nbecame suspicious, and reported what she had learned to the agency\u2019s inspector\ngeneral (Id.). \nThe agency\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office then conducted an investigation (Id.). On\nthe afternoon of September 28, 2005, after confirming that Applicant wrongfully\naccessed the e-mails, an investigative agent questioned Applicant (Exhibit 2 at 6).\nApplicant admitted to the misconduct. Consequently, the agency then notified\nApplicant\u2019s employer, immediately revoked his SCI access, confiscated his badges, and\nescorted him from the building (Tr. 106). Earlier that day, Applicant had given his\nemployer two-weeks notice of his resignation so that he could take a position with the\ncompany with whom he currently works (Exhibit 2 at 6). Applicant did not know he was\nunder investigation when he resigned (Tr. 106). In an interoffice memo, a human\nresources representative from Applicant\u2019s ex-employer characterized the relationship\nbetween his resignation and the subsequent discovery of his misconduct as coincidental\n(Exhibit 3 at 4). \nWhen Applicant returned home, he notified his part-time employer of the incident,\nand asked if he could still work there (Tr. 107). He had submitted his two-weeks notice\nto his part-time employer at the same time he had submitted it to his primary employer\n(Id.). His part-time employer refused his request, and allowed him to leave without\nworking the last two weeks (Id.).\nThe facility security officer (FSO) of Applicant\u2019s current employer interviewed him\nin early October, as part of a routine background check (Tr. 70 - Testimony of FSO). At\nthe time of the interview, the FSO had approximately 25 years of experience working in\nthe defense security field (Tr. 70). The company\u2019s program manager had already\nextended Applicant a job offer (Tr. 72). Before the interview, the FSO performed a\nroutine check of Applicant\u2019s security clearance history through the Department of\nDefense Security Service\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). It revealed\nthat Applicant\u2019s SCI had been revoked, and that he retained a Top Secret clearance (Tr.\n75). When the FSO asked about the circumstances surrounding the revocation of his\nSCI access, Applicant discussed it honestly and remorsefully (Tr. 75, 79).\n\n4\nThe FSO was perplexed as to how Applicant lost his SCI access, but retained his\nTop Secret clearance (Tr. 77). He testified to the following conversation with a DSS\nrepresentative:\nI said, \u2018I\u2019ve spoken to the Program Manager, and they want to hire this\nindividual, but I\u2019m leery about hiring him, because if we hire him, will they\nturn around in 30 days based on this event and pull his clearance?\u2019\nAnd they said, . . . \u2018anything can happen tomorrow or the next day, but as\nof today, he is a cleared individual who can be hired and use his Top\nSecret clearance . . .\u2019 (Tr. 78). \nThe FSO then went to the company president and told her that \u201cthe government\nhas chosen not to pull Applicant\u2019s Top Secret clearance, [and he was not] in a position\nright now . . .  to think that [Applicant] could be . . . put in a position to compromise his\nclearance information\u201d (Tr. 79).\nApplicant was then hired for a one-year probationary period (Tr. 77). During this\nperiod, the FSO closely monitored him, speaking to the program manager quarterly, and\nobserving his work relationships (Tr. 80, 82). Applicant successfully completed the\nprobationary period (Tr. 81). Also, he has completed multiple security trainings over the\npast four years (see generally, Exhibit H). In sum, he has demonstrated \u201cimpeccable\ncharacter and security awareness\u201d since working for his current employer (Tr. 83). \nApplicant has completely rebuilt his wife\u2019s level of trust with him (Tr. 32). She\ncharacterized their current relationship as \u201cgreat\u201d (Tr. 32). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). \nApplicant while serving the Department of Defense as a network analyst had an\naffair with a woman whom he met while installing her information systems network as\npart of his job duties. After she ended the affair, he abused his network privileges by\naccessing her e-mails without her permission or his employer\u2019s authorization, on 25\noccasions. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . .\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s contention that his resignation from his employer was unrelated to\ntheir discovery of his misconduct is supported by his ex-employer\u2019s internal memoranda\nthat the government submitted. I conclude that he did not resign from his employment in\nlieu of being fired, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. I resolve SOR 1.c in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor.\nApplicant\u2019s \ninappropriate \nworkplace \nbehavior \ncalls \ninto \nquestion \nhis\ntrustworthiness. However, I decline to apply AG \u00b6 16(d)(1), \u201cuntrustworthy or unreliable\nbehavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other government protected information,\u201d\nor AG \u00b6 16(d)(2), \u201cdisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace,\u201d\nor AG \u00b6 16(d)(4), \u201cevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s\ntime or resources.\u201dAll of these factors accurately characterize his conduct; however,\ntheir applicability under Guideline E is predicated on Applicant\u2019s conduct not being\n\u201cexplicitly covered under any other guideline\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(d)). Applicant\u2019s conduct is\ncovered under both Guidelines M, Use of Information Technology Systems (AG \u00b6\u00b6 39-\n41), and K, Handling Protected Information, (AG \u00b6\u00b6 33-35), rendering their discussion\nunder these particular Guideline E disqualifying conditions superfluous.\nApplicant reconciled with his wife. He has not engaged in additional episodes of\nadultery. His current employer was aware of the conduct when it hired him. Applicant\ndiscussed the incident comprehensively and remorsefully with his current employer\u2019s\n\nDoD 5220.22-M, \u00b6 8-105.\n1\n6\nFSO, who then recommended his hiring, after confirming with DSS that he still retained\na Top Secret clearance. In the four years since working for his current employer, he has\ncompleted multiple security trainings, and has demonstrated outstanding character and\nsecurity awareness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d and 17(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d apply.\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe security concern under this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 39 as follows:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information technology systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nAs a network administrator with special access for troubleshooting or monitoring\nhis company\u2019s information security systems, Applicant was a \u201cprivileged user\u201d under the\nNational Industrial Security Program Operating Manual  (NISPOM). Applicant abused\n1\nhis privileged user status, and violated company policy by viewing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s e-\nmail without her knowledge or consent. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a), \u201cillegal or\nunauthorized entry into any information system or component thereof,\u201d and 40(e),\n\u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct occurred four years ago and has not recurred. His current\nemployer is pleased with his work performance and adherence to security standards.\nAG \u00b6 41(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information\nUnder this guideline, \u201cdeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern\u201d (AG \u00b6 33). Applicant accessed his\nex-girlfriend\u2019s e-mail without authorization. Some of the e-mails Applicant accessed\n\n7\nwithout authorization contained classified information of which he had no need to know.\nAG \u00b6 34(d), \u201cinappropriate efforts to obtain or view classified or other protected\ninformation outside one\u2019s need-to-know,\u201d applies. Applicant also violated the NISPOM\u2019s\nrequirement for privileged information system users to \u201cbe accountable for their actions\u201d\non an information system (\u00b6 8-105c.(3)).\nApplicant has not committed any security violations in four years. He has\ncompleted multiple security trainings, and displays an outstanding attitude toward\nsecurity awareness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d and 34(b), \u201cthe individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial\nsecurity training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of\nsecurity responsibilities,\u201d apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct breached his wife\u2019s trust, his employer\u2019s trust, and the\nfederal government\u2019s trust when he engaged in an affair with a government employee,\nthen abused his networking privileges to furtively monitor her e-mail. Applicant had\nnever engaged in similar conduct in the past, and it has not recurred. His current\nemployer is highly pleased with his work performance and security awareness.\nApplicant has successfully completed multiple security trainings, and enrolled in college\nearning a degree in information systems in 2008. Also, he has repaired his relationship\nwith his wife. The seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct is outweighed by the presence of\nrehabilitation and the amount of time that has elapsed since its occurrence. Under these\ncircumstances, the likelihood of recurrence is minimal. Upon considering the applicable\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions together with the whole person concept, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline K:\nFOR Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was\nreceived by the DOHA on January 14, 2008. The DOHA notified him by letter, dated\nJanuary 17, 2008, that his answer could not be considered complete because he did not\nproperly answer the allegations. Applicant submitted a second response to the SOR that\nwas received by the DOHA on February 4, 2008, in which he admitted the allegations\ncontained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.y, denied the remaining allegations, and\nrequested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 30, 2008\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 8, 2008, and\nreassigned to me on February 11, 2008, to be heard in conjunction with other cases I had\nscheduled in the same region. A notice of hearing was issued on February 27, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for March 20, 2008. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The\ngovernment submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted 1 documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) 1, and\nadmitted into the record without objection. The record was held open to allow Applicant to\nsubmit additional documents in support of his case. Two additional documents were timely\nreceived, marked as AE 2 & 3, and admitted into the record without objection. Department\nCounsel\u2019s forwarding endorsement on the additional submissions was marked as Appellate\nExhibit (App. Ex.) I and included as part of the record. The transcript was received on April\n9, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 41 years old and has been employed as a sheet metal mechanic by\ndefense contractors since April 2005. He has proven himself to be highly reliable and a\nvery willing team member/employee who is considered to be an asset to his company.\nApplicant was employed as a sheet metal mechanic by the U.S. Air Force from January\n1992 until he was laid off in June 2004. He was unemployed from July 2004 to December\n2004, and then worked as a machine operator until he was dismissed in April 2005\nbecause he was unable to maintain production quotas.\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1985. He served on active duty with the Air\nForce from March 1987 to March 1990, and attained the rank of airman first class\n(paygrade E-3). He served in the Air Force reserve from January 1991 to June 1994, and\nattained the rank of senior airman (paygrade E-4). Applicant has possessed a secret level\nsecurity clearance for most of the time since he was in the Air Force. No prior adverse\naction has been taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance.\nApplicant married the first time in February 1996. That marriage ended in divorce\nin February 2001. There were no children born of that marriage. He has been remarried\nsince October 2002. He has two children, ages eight and six, from this relationship.    \nApplicant and his first wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in or about\n1997. Although he listed continuous civilian employment with the Air Force between 1992\nand 2004 in the security clearance applications he submitted, Applicant testified he was\nactually laid off for about eighteen months beginning in 1997. While he found other\nemployment during the layoff, his salary dropped from somewhere between $14 and $15\nan hour to whatever the minimum wage was at the time. Applicant successfully completed\nthe Chapter 13 wage earner plan and obtained a discharge in or about 2002. \n\n3\nThe SOR alleges 19 collection accounts, totaling $2,877, resulting from delinquent\nmedical bills. Applicant testified he experienced a number of medical conditions, including\ndiabetes, heart stent emplacement, and ankle surgery over the past ten years or so, but\nthat he always had medical insurance and paid the required co-pays before receiving\ntreatment. He has sent a letter to the various credit reporting agencies challenging the\nlegitimacy of most of these accounts, asserting they should have been paid by insurance\ncompanies.\nThe SOR alleges another 16 delinquent accounts, totaling $5,884, that have been\nsubmitted for collection. Those accounts range from charges for telephone and television\nservice to a returned check that appears to have been presented at a restaurant. The SOR\nalso alleges two accounts, totaling $1,531, that have been charged off as bad debts.\nApplicant sent a letter to the various credit reporting agencies challenging the legitimacy\nof most of these accounts, asserting they either do not belong to him or are duplicates of\nother accounts.\nThe SOR alleges one additional account charged off as a bad debt in the amount\nof $11,295 that represents the deficiency owing after the sale of a repossessed\nautomobile. Applicant admits he voluntarily allowed the vehicle to be repossessed and that\nhe is responsible for this account. He claims he has contacted the creditor and has started\nto make payments on this account, but he did not provide any verification of a payment\nhaving actually been made.\nApplicant contacted a representative of his employee assistance program upon\nreceipt of the SOR and was advised to seek assistance from a consumer credit counseling\nservice. He then contacted a credit counseling service and was further advised he should\nsend a letter to the credit reporting services disputing all credit report entries that either\nwere not his or that he did not recognize as being his accounts. The letters referred to\nabove were recently sent based upon that advice. As advised, Applicant intends to contact\nthe credit counseling service after he receives responses to the accounts he has disputed\nin an effort to establish a payment plan for whatever accounts remain on his credit reports.\nApplicant submitted security clearance applications in May 2005 and May 2007 in\nwhich he failed to disclose, as required, that he had any accounts that had been over 180\ndays delinquent in the preceding seven years or were more than 90 days delinquent at the\ntime those applications were submitted. In the 2005 application, Applicant did disclose a\ncriminal charge related to a bounced check, a wage garnishment, and the repossession\nof an automobile. In the 2007 application, he disclosed the bounced check charge, the\ngarnishment, and that he had been fired from a job. \nApplicant testified he failed to list the numerous delinquent accounts in the security\nclearance applications he submitted because he was unaware some accounts were\ndelinquent, he misunderstood some questions, and he was provided wrong information\nwhen he sought assistance in answering the questions. His demeanor, appearance, and\nmanner of testifying make it abundantly clear he is very unworldly in such matters. His\n\n Department Counsel, on behalf of the Government, conceded in his closing argument that there was\n2\nnot a deliberate falsification by Applicant in this case. (Tr. p. 82) \n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

He did not deliberately provide false answers in the security\nclearance applications.      \n2\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n5\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1997 and, after successful\ncompletion of a wage earner plan, obtained a discharge in or about 2002. He now has\naccumulated numerous delinquent debts, totalling more than $21,000, that have been\neither charged off as bad debts or submitted for collection. While many of the debts are for\nmedical expenses, others are for items ranging from telephone and television service to\nbad checks presented at a restaurant. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\nApplicant admits he is personally responsible for the $11,295 charged off account\nthat resulted from his decision to allow the voluntary repossession of an automobile. While\nhe claims he has contacted this creditor and has started to make payment on the debt, he\ndid not provide any verification in support of that claim. \nHis testimony that he had health insurance when the various medical expenses\nalleged in the SOR became delinquent is credible. Notwithstanding, he did not provide any\nevidence to indicate the charges are not uncovered expenses that are his responsibility.\nApplicant sought the assistance of a consumer credit counseling service and, based on the\nadvice he received, sent letters to the various credit reporting services challenging most\nof the delinquent accounts that appear in his credit reports. However, he has not\naccomplished anything to satisfy any of those accounts or provided any basis to conclude\nthey will be resolved in any fashion in the foreseeable future. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take any meaningful action to resolve the numerous debts that\nhave been delinquent for years prohibits application of Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a):\nthe behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC\n20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\n\n6\nor a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances; MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts.  \nAlthough Applicant claims he does not recognize a number of the creditors listed in\nthe SOR and has submitted disputes to the credit reporting services to that effect, he\npresented no meaningful basis to conclude they are not his debts that have been sold to\nsuccessor creditors. Accordingly, I conclude MC 20(e): the individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue has no applicability to the facts of this case. The remaining\nmitigating condition, MC 20(f), is also inapplicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 15)\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his failure to disclose his many delinquent accounts in\nthe security clearance applications he submitted in 2005 and 2007 are credible. Those\nexplanations, combined with the abundant adverse information he did disclose in the\napplications, establish that he did not deliberately provide false answers in the security\nclearance applications. Accordingly, no disqualifying condition under Guideline E applies.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. He has neither overcome the case against\nhim nor  satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against\nApplicant. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-mm:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 13, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn November 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 4, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 31, 2007. Applicant did not\nrespond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 27, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant is indebted to AAC on an account that was charged off by MBNA and\nreferred for collection in the approximate amount of $35,743.00.\nApplicant is indebted to American Express for a charged off account in the\napproximate amount of $12,919.00.\nApplicant denies he is indebted to AAC in the approximate amount of $263.00 on\nan account referred for collection by Target. However, this debt is listed on his most\nrecent credit report (Exhibit 7).\nApplicant is indebted to Hilco Receivables in the approximate amount of\n$5,102.00 on an account that was charged off by MBNA.\nApplicant is indebted to Discover Card in the approximate amount of $8,581.00.\nThis debt has been referred for collection.\nApplicant denies he is indebted to West Asset Management in the approximate\namount of $1,237.00 on an account referred for collection by a medical center. This\ndebt is listed as a medical debt on applicant\u2019s most recent credit report, which also\nnotes he disputed it.\nApplicant denies he is indebted to Certegy on a charged off account in the\napproximate amount of $211.00. This debt is listed on his most recent credit report.\nApplicant is indebted to Unifund on two debts referred to it for collection. The\nfirst, in the amount of $30,927.00, was referred by First USA bank. The second, in the\namount of $18,804.00, was referred by Chase.\nApplicant denies he is indebted to Bank of America in the approximate amount of\n$16,493.00. This debt is listed on his February 2006 credit report (Exhibit 9).\nApplicant denies he is indebted to First Revenue in the approximate amount of\n$565.00 on an account referred to it for collection by XCEL Energy. This debt is listed\non his most recent credit report.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\n\n3\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security\nconcerns. The evidence establishes that applicant has a long history of being unable or\nunwilling to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\n\n4\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph a. may apply where\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d This mitigation condition is not\napplicable.\nUnder Paragraph b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\npresented no evidence that would justify application of this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations. Even if he were given the benefit of the\ndoubt with respect to the debts he denies owing, the evidence establishes that he still\nowes over $100,000.00 to five creditors for six debts, all of which were either charged\noff or referred for collection. Under these circumstances, I conclude applicant failed to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from Guideline F.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 26,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 14, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FCMC); and whether the Judge\nerred in her whole-person analysis.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant works as a trainer for a\nfederal contractor.  In 1982 Applicant entered into a long-term relationship with a man whom she\nnever married.  She ended the relationship in 2000.  She has three children from this relationship,\nranging in age from 11 to 23.  \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts arising from her relationship with her partner.\nAlthough she attempted to pay the debts, she defaulted on some of them, receiving no assistance\nfrom her partner, \u201cwho had created much of the debt problem.\u201d  Decision at 4.  Although Applicant\nacknowledges some of the debts, she disagrees with others.  She completed an Associates Degree\nin Applied Science in 2005 and \u201cincurred no unpaid debts for her education.\u201d  Id at 3.  She has\npurchased a modular home for herself and her children and is current on her mortgage payments.\nShe has paid off a recent automobile loan and has opened credit card accounts in the three years\npreceding the decision, for which she makes timely payments.      \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \n\n3\nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  However, in\nthe course of arguing the assigned errors, Department Counsel asserts that the Judge did not give\nsufficient weight to contrary record evidence.  The Board will address this matter below.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that FCMC 20(a) mitigated the security concerns in Applicant\u2019s case,\nin that they were not likely to recur and that they do not raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d  Decision at 6.  (See Directive \u00b6 E2.20(a): \u201c[T]he\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment . . .\u201d) Department Counsel persuasively argues, however, that the ongoing nature\nof the debts vitiates the Judge\u2019s conclusion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03695 at (App. Bd. Oct.\n16, 2002) (Failure to discharge debts is \u201ca continuing course of conduct . . . \u201d) Given the number of\n\n\u201cIn light of how Applicant conducted herself during this relationship, the debts that arose . . . should be viewed\n1\nas the equivalent of marital debts . . .\u201d  Department Counsel Brief at 11.   \nLoss of employment, business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, death, divorce or separation.  \n2\n \u201c. . . Applicant played a significant role in overextending [her and her partner\u2019s] finances, and . . . Applicant\n3\ncompounded her debts problems by making financial decisions preventing her from resolving these debts in a timely,\nreasonable, and good faith manner.\u201d  Id. at 13.  \n4\nthese ongoing debts, and the lack of record evidence as to Applicant\u2019s efforts to address them,\nApplicant has failed to meet her burden of persuasion as to this mitigating condition.    \n Additionally, Department Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s favorable application of  FCMC\n20(b) (Directive \u00b6 E2.29(b): \u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances . . .\u201d)\nDepartment Counsel points to record evidence that Applicant took her partner\u2019s name and submitted\nfederal tax returns as married filing jointly.  Such evidence raises the reasonable implication that\nApplicant and her partner held themselves out as married, which would have facilitated her partner\u2019s\nhaving obtained credit in both their names.   This evidence is contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\n1\nApplicant\u2019s bad debts arose from matters outside her control.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not explain\nhow, under the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s circumstances are equivalent to those examples listed\nin FCMC 20(b).     Furthermore, the fact that Applicant has apparently established a current good\n2\ncredit rating, as evidenced by her housing, college tuition, and car payments, and her currency on\ncredit card debts, demonstrates a capacity to pay debt.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that\nthis capacity contrasts with Applicant\u2019s failure to address her delinquent debt and casts serious doubt\nas to the extent to which she has acted responsibly in regard to that debt.  The weight of the record\nevidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion under\nFCMC 20(b).3\nFor similar reasons, Department Counsel argues that Applicant has failed to meet her burden\nof persuasion under FCMC 20(c)  (Directive \u00b6 E2.20(c): \u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control . . .\u201d)   There is no record evidence that Applicant has sought credit counseling.\nWhile Applicant has established a satisfactory record as to her current expenses, the record does not\nsupport a conclusion that she has made a reasonable attempt to resolve these debts alleged in the\nSOR.  Making allowances for Applicant\u2019s contention that some of the debts are not hers, those that\nremain are numerous and of considerable amounts.  Under the facts of this case, these ongoing and\nsubstantial debts raise security concerns which Applicant\u2019s evidence does not reasonably mitigate\nunder the mitigating conditions.  Additionally, Department Counsel persuasively challenges the\nJudge\u2019s analysis of FCMC 20(e) (Directive \u00b6 E2.20(e): \u201c[T]he individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue . . .\u201d) on the ground that it applies only to two of the many debts alleged in the SOR.  In any\nevent, Department Counsel correctly notes that Applicant has provided little by way of documented\n\n5\nproof of her basis for disputing the debts.  The weight of the record evidence does not support a\nconclusion that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion under the Financial Considerations\nMitigating Conditions.  \nIn light of the errors noted above the Board remands the case to the Judge.  The Judge is\ninstructed to issue a new decision that does not rely upon the application of the aforesaid mitigating\nconditions.  As a result of the foregoing, it is premature to address the remaining issue raised on\nappeal.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 7, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 13, 2007. DOHA received the request on\nMay 14, 2008\n\nResponses to SOR; Tr. 46-48.\n1\n2\nDecember 20, 2007. She requested a hearing before an administrative judge on\nJanuary 12, 2008, which DOHA received on January 17, 2008. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on January 23, 2008, and this case was assigned to another\nadministrative judge on January 25, 2008. Because of workload adjustments, this case\nwas reassigned to me on March 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 10, 2008. The government\noffered four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted 11 exhibits (AE)\nA through K. Except for AE D, all were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. AE D would be admitted provided Applicant provided an additional document.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 18, 2008. I held the record\nopen for Applicant to submit additional matters.  She submitted AE L-N and the\nadditional document for AE D. Department Counsel responded to these submissions on\nMay 8, 2008, which were received and admitted without objection. The record closed on\nMay 8, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, I discussed Applicant\u2019s receipt of the hearing notice on April 1,\n2008, less than 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 9.) I advised Applicant of her right\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant\naffirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n,\nalleging additional debts owed by Applicant. (Tr. at 10-11.) Applicant did not object to\nthe motion, which was granted. (Id.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 13, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR, with explanations. She\ndenied the remaining factual allegations in the SOR. She also provided additional\ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Her discussions\nregarding allegations 1.m and 1.n at the hearing are treated as admissions of the debts.\n(Tr. 10-12.) At the hearing, Department Counsel agreed that the allegations in \u00b6 1.a and\n1.d of the SOR are the same debt. 1\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated December 22, 2006) at 1, 6; Tr. 18-20, 118.\n2\nTr. 20-21, 23.\n3\nTr. 24, 60-82, 113.\n4\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated February 6, 2007); GE 4 (Credit report, dated January 23, 2008); AE A (Copy of\n5\nbank statement); AE B (February 11, 2008 letter showing final car payment); AE C (Bank statement); Tr. 21-\n22, 24-26, 79, 81-82, 84, 86, 89-90, 92, 118.\n3\nApplicant is 50 years old. She works as a trainer for a Department of Defense\ncontractor, a part-time position she has held for three years. The same employer hired\nher to work another position, which requires a security clearance. With the denial of her\nclearance, she is unable to work this second position.2\nIn 1982, Applicant entered into a long-term relationship with a man she never\nmarried. She ended this relationship in 2000. She has three children from this\nrelationship, ages 23, 17, and 11, who still live at home. The oldest, a daughter, attends\ncollege and works part-time.3\nDuring the long tenure of the above relationship, Applicant and her significant\nother purchased and paid for two trailers, where they lived. Most of the time, she placed\nthe trailers on rural land she owned jointly with her mother, who lived nearby. They also\npurchased and paid for motor vehicles and held joint bank accounts. They had credit\ncards and other credit. They made the required payments. During this relationship,\nApplicant work full-time or part-time periodically. She worked when her mother could\nbabysit the children. Her significant other worked intermittently, but never on a\ncontinuous basis and was not a reliable babysitter. She received no employment related\nbenefits during this relationship. Her significant other liked to apply for and obtain credit\ncards, in his name and in her name without her knowledge, which began to cause\nissues with increased debt. Towards the end of the relationship, credit card debts\nmounted and past efforts to maintain the credit card payments were abandoned\nbecause of sporadic income.       \n4\nApplicant ended this relationship in 2000 because of debt issues and his\ninfidelity. She immediately closed the joint bank accounts. After her gall bladder surgery,\nshe found employment and has worked steadily since 2000. She has not spoken with\nher significant other since 2002. She currently works at a fast food restaurant and part-\ntime with a government contractor in a non-clearance position. She completed an\nassociates degree in Applied Science in 2005 and incurred no unpaid debt for her\neducation. She bought a larger modular home for she and her children because they\nneeded new housing. She timely pays her loan on this property. Because public\ntransportation is not available to her, she bought and paid for two cars in the last seven\nyears. She paid the remaining balance on her most recent car loan with her 2007 tax\nrefund. She opened credit card accounts in her own name in the last three years. She\ntimely meets her monthly payments on these cards. Through these efforts, she re-\nestablished her commercial credit worthiness.  \n5\n\nGE 3, supra note 5; GE 4 supra note 5, at 3; Tr. 49-50.\n6\nAE A (Copy of bank statement, dated February 14, 2008 through March 13, 2008) at 2; AE C (Copy of bank\n7\nstatement, dated January 16, 2008 to February 14, 2008) at 1; Tr. 53-60.\n4\nApplicant currently earns $7.50 an hour at the fast food restaurant. She works as\nmany hours as the restaurant will give her, usually between 32 and 40 hours a week.\nHer gross earnings through March 15, 2008 totaled $2,600, and her net income totaled\n$2,320. She works, on average, 10 days every six weeks for the Department of Defense\ncontractor, earning $12.50 an hour. Her gross income from this job, as of the hearing\ndate, totaled $1,936 and her net pay totaled $1,800. Her monthly expenses include a\nmortgage of $432, utilities of $80, car insurance of $110, $400 for food, $62 for\ntelephone, $80 for gasoline, $48 for Direct TV, and $40 for credit cards for a total of\n$1,252. She does not receive any child support for her children. Her current income\nprovides enough to pay her monthly living expenses.\nWith the exception of the two debts listed in \u00b6 1.m and 1.n of the SOR,\nApplicant\u2019s unpaid debts occurred when her long-term relationship ended. She\nattempted to pay the debts, but between July 2001 and January 2002, she defaulted on\nthe credit card debts, as she received no financial assistance from her significant other\nwho had created much of the debt problem. In her response to the SOR, she denied\nmany of the debts because she did not recognize the listed creditor. At the hearing, she\nacknowledged several debts after the original creditor was identified. She disagrees with\nthe total amount she owes. Her January 23, 2008 credit report reflects she challenged\nthe validity of the $1,023 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, a debt she does not recognize) and $2,198 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.c.) debts. Contrary to the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.h, the February 6, 2007 credit report\nindicates this account has a zero balance and a high credit of $1,234, not an unpaid\nbalance of $1,234, and the account was transferred to recovery. The record does not\nindicated which creditor now holds this account and Applicant does not recognize the\naccount.6\nApplicant paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.m., which arose over a dispute with the\ncreditor over service not performed. The $57 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n. relates to collect long-\ndistances telephone charges from Mexico made to her home telephone when no one\nwas at home. She spoke by telephone with her long-distance carrier about the charges\non several occasions. Her calls lead to the removal of one call, but not the other calls.\nShe cancelled her service with this long-distance telephone carrier, which is not the\nlisted creditor. The actual bill is listed as a debt to her local telephone carrier because\nthe long-distance carrier\u2019s bill is included in the local telephone carrier\u2019s bill. She\ncontinues her telephone service with the telephone carrier identified as the creditor and\nregularly pays her bill.7\nApplicant enjoys her work as a trainer. Her employer describes her trainer skills\nas valuable because she demonstrates remarkable adaption skills in her various trainer\nroles. Former employers provide very favorable recommendations on her work skills\nand ethics, as do friends and former professors. When she learned that she would be\n\nAE E through AE J; Tr. 22.\n8\n5\nunable to do the security segment of her trainer job, she found other employment which\nenables her to provide her family with basic necessities including food and housing.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Towards the end of her long-term relationship, Applicant and her\nsignificant other accumulated delinquent credit card debt. She attempted to pay the\ndebt, but eventually defaulted on the obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems began to increase significantly toward the end of the 1990s, when\nher then significant other continued to obtain credit cards in both their individual names.\nAfter she ended this relationship, she attempted to continue with the debt payments, but\ncould not do so. She defaulted on the credit card debts between about July 2001 and\nJanuary 2002. Since that time, she has always paid the mortgage on her home and her\ncar payments. She remains current on her existing credit card debts and does not have\nnew, unpaid debt. She has not had any contact with her significant other for six years\nand he is no longer a part of her life. The credit problems created by his actions are not\nlikely to reoccur. This mitigating condition applies because I find the behavior occurred\nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about her\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not relevant to this case.\n9\nA  State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of\n10\nlimitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate\nactivity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human\naffairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable\ngoal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations\nprovide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be\n7\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nApplicant\u2019 s financial problems arose because her former significant other obtained and\nused credit cards without her knowledge, without sufficient financial resources to pay\nthe debt incurred. She also used the credit cards and attempted to make the payments\nfor sometime after she ended her long-term relationship with him. His failure to provide\nchild support and her limited earning capacity prevented her from keeping up the\npayments. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not met with a financial\ncounselor. However, in the last eight years, she has always paid her mortgage and car\npayments. In the last three years, she acquired several new credit cards with a small\ncredit line. She regularly makes these payments. She does not live beyond her income\nand manages her current financial resources prudently. This mitigating condition applies\npartially.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid\none recent overdue debt, but has not paid any other debts. She has not initiated any\npayments of her older debts, I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not\napply.\nApplicant did not recognize many of the debtors listed in the SOR, although at\nthe hearing, when the original creditor was identified, she did recognize the debt. When\nshe did not recognize two debts, she challenged the validity with the credit reporting\ncompanies as shown by her January 2008 credit report.  AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d partially applies.9\nShe also receives some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the\napplication of the State\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations, which applies to all the debts\nlisted in the SOR except the debts in allegations 1.m and 1.n. Under State law, the\ncreditors are time barred from collecting these debts See  State Code. Ann. \u00a744-501.10\n\nha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage\nplaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our\njudicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n8\nElimination of these delinquent debts through the statute of limitations has ended her\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements related to these debts as she\nno longer has any legal responsibility for these debts. The fact that these debts are very\nold and not collectible under state law does not negate her past conduct in not paying\nher outstanding debts, a factor I must consider.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts are a\nserious problem. Although finances were usually very limited during her long-term\nrelationship, she always paid the mortgage and car payments. Her financial problems\nfirst became unmanageable when her significant other started obtaining credit cards\nand abusing the credit. While she used the cards for family needs and initially paid the\nbills, over time, the bills began to mount. When she ended her relationship, she tried,\nbut could not continue making payments on the credit card debt, in part because she\nreceived no financial support from her significant other. (See AG & 2(a)(1)-(3).) \nApplicant obtained employment in 2000 and has worked steadily since this time.\nShe returned to school, eventually earning an associates degree. With her additional\neducation skills, she sought better paying employment in order to provide for her\n\n9\nchildren. Her credit reports show no outstanding debt from her education. See AG\n\u00b62(a)(6).\nApplicant became the sole financial provider for her three children when she\nended her long-term relationship with their father. In determining how to use her limited\nresources, she made decisions which provided her children with their basic needs, such\nas livable housing, food and clothes. To meet these needs, Applicant needed\ntransportation to and from work since the rural area where she lived lacked public\ntransportation. She has purchased and paid for two used cars.  Her two recent, small\ndebts arose when she disputed the charges, one for services she did not receive and\none for telephone calls not made by her family. On her own, Applicant has paid her bills\nin a timely manner and managed her limited financial resources prudently. She currently\nworks two jobs. In the last eight years, Applicant had to make choices about using her\nscare resources. She always made financial decisions which favored providing for the\nneeds of her children. She made an effort to pay the credit card debt incurred during her\nlong-term relationship, but ultimately decided that she needed to start fresh financially\nand went to school for better employment opportunities. Since that time, Applicant has\nundergone significant behavioral changes. She works steadily and consistently. She is a\nreliable and dependable employee. She pays her current bills and limits the amount of\ncredit on her credit cards. She pays her bills and fights with creditors over bills she does\nnot believe she owes. She acts responsibly in all aspects of her life. Her current\nfinances are good. She has no criminal record and her children are doing well. She has\nfocused her attention on providing a stable domestic environment for her family. Over\nthe years, she has lacked sufficient resources to pay her old credit card debt; however,\nthat debt was never reduced to a judgment and the Statute of Limitations has expired,\nmaking it uncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus, these debts cannot be a source of\nimproper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts\nare paidBit is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to\nhold a security clearance. While some old debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to\nraise security concerns as she has demonstrated that she is a reliable and responsible\nindividual. (See AG & 2(a)(1), (7)-(9).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Based on a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and remand order, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December\n22, 2006. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 7, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 13, 2007. DOHA received the request on\nDecember 20, 2007. She requested a hearing before an administrative judge on\nJanuary 12, 2008, which DOHA received on January 17, 2008. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on January 23, 2008, and this case was assigned to another\nadministrative judge on January 25, 2008. Because of workload adjustments, this case\nwas reassigned to me on March 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 10, 2008. The government\noffered four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted 11 exhibits (AE)\nA through K. Except for AE D, all were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. AE D would be admitted provided Applicant provided an additional document.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 18, 2008. I held the record\nopen for Applicant to submit additional matters.  She submitted AE L-N and the\nadditional document for AE D. Department Counsel responded to these submissions on\nMay 8, 2008, which were received and admitted without objection. The record closed on\nMay 8, 2008.\nDOHA issued my decision on May 14, 2008. Department Counsel appealed it,\nalleging error in my findings under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), and (e). The Appeal Board\nremand this case for further findings.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, I discussed Applicant\u2019s receipt of the hearing notice on April 1,\n2008, less than 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 9.) I advised Applicant of her right\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant\naffirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n,\nalleging additional debts owed by Applicant. (Tr. at 10-11.) Applicant did not object to\nthe motion, which was granted. (Id.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 13, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR, with explanations. She\ndenied the remaining factual allegations in the SOR. She also provided additional\ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Her discussions\nregarding allegations 1.m and 1.n at the hearing are treated as admissions of the debts.\n\nResponses to SOR; Tr. 46-48.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated December 22, 2006) at 1, 6; Tr. 18-20, 118.\n2\nTr. 20-21, 23.\n3\nTr. 24, 60-82, 113.\n4\n3\n(Tr. 10-12.) At the hearing, Department Counsel agreed that the allegations in \u00b6 1.a and\n1.d of the SOR are the same debt. 1\nApplicant is 50 years old. She works as a trainer for a Department of Defense\ncontractor, a part-time position she has held for three years. The same employer hired\nher to work another position, which requires a security clearance. With the denial of her\nclearance, she is unable to work this second position.2\nIn 1982, Applicant entered into a long-term relationship with a man she never\nmarried. She ended this relationship in 2000. She has three children from this\nrelationship, ages 23, 17, and 11, who still live at home. The oldest, a daughter, attends\ncollege and works part-time.3\nDuring the long tenure of the above relationship, Applicant and her significant\nother purchased and paid for two trailers, where they lived. Most of the time, she placed\nthe trailers on rural land she owned jointly with her mother, who lived nearby. They also\npurchased and paid for motor vehicles and held joint bank accounts. They had credit\ncards and other credit. They made the required payments. During this relationship,\nApplicant work full-time or part-time periodically. She worked when her mother could\nbabysit the children. Her significant other worked intermittently, but never on a\ncontinuous basis and was not a reliable babysitter. She received no employment related\nbenefits during this relationship. Her significant other liked to apply for and obtain credit\ncards, in his name and in her name without her knowledge, which began to cause\nissues with increased debt. Towards the end of the relationship, credit card debts\nmounted and past efforts to maintain the credit card payments were abandoned\nbecause of sporadic income.       \n4\nApplicant ended this relationship in 2000 because of debt issues and his\ninfidelity. She immediately closed the joint bank accounts. After her gall bladder surgery,\nshe found employment and has worked steadily since 2000. She has not spoken with\nher significant other since 2002. She currently works at a fast food restaurant and part-\ntime with a government contractor in a non-clearance position. She completed an\nassociates degree in Applied Science in 2005 and incurred no unpaid debt for her\neducation. She bought a larger modular home for her and her children because they\nneeded new housing. She timely pays her $40,000 loan on this property. Because\npublic transportation is not available to her, she bought and paid for two cars in the last\nseven years. She paid the remaining balance on her most recent car loan with her 2007\ntax refund. She opened credit card accounts in her own name in the last three years.\n\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated February 6, 2007); GE 4 (Credit report, dated January 23, 2008); AE A (Copy of\n5\nbank statement); AE B (February 11, 2008 letter showing final car payment); AE C (Bank statement); Tr. 21-\n22, 24-26, 79, 81-82, 84, 86, 89-90, 92, 118.\nGE 3, supra note 5; GE 4 supra note 5, at 3; Tr. 49-50.\n6\n4\nShe timely meets her monthly payments on these cards. Through these efforts, she re-\nestablished her commercial credit worthiness.  \n5\nApplicant currently earns $7.50 an hour at the fast food restaurant. She works as\nmany hours as the restaurant will give her, usually between 32 and 40 hours a week.\nHer gross earnings through March 15, 2008 totaled $2,600, and her net income totaled\n$2,320. She works, on average, 10 days every six weeks for the Department of Defense\ncontractor, earning $12.50 an hour. Her gross income from this job, as of the hearing\ndate, totaled $1,936 and her net pay totaled $1,800. With these two jobs, her net\nmonthly income averages $1,528. Her monthly expenses include a mortgage of $432,\nutilities of $80, car insurance of $110, $400 for food, $62 for telephone, $80 for\ngasoline, $48 for Direct TV, and $40 for credit cards for a total of $1,252. Over the last\nsix months, the increases in crude oil prices have impacted the prices of good and\nservices needed for every day living. As a result, I find that her basic living expense\nhave increased a $100 a month. She does not receive any child support for her\nchildren. Her current income provides enough to pay her monthly living expenses.\nWith the exception of the two debts listed in \u00b6 1.m and 1.n of the SOR,\nApplicant\u2019s unpaid debts occurred when her long-term relationship ended. She\nattempted to pay the debts, but between July 2001 and January 2002, she defaulted on\nthe credit card debts, as she received no financial assistance from her significant other\nwho had created much, but not all, of the debt problem. In her response to the SOR,\nshe denied many of the debts because she did not recognize the listed creditor. At the\nhearing, she acknowledged several debts after the original creditor was identified. She\ndisagrees with the total amount she owes. Her January 23, 2008 credit report reflects\nshe challenged the validity of the $1,023 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, a debt she does not recognize)\nand $2,198 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) debts. Contrary to the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.h, the February 6,\n2007 credit report indicates this account has a zero balance and a high credit of $1,234,\nnot an unpaid balance of $1,234, and the account was transferred to recovery. The\nrecord does not indicate which creditor now holds this account and Applicant does not\nrecognize the account.6\nApplicant paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.m., which arose over a dispute with the\ncreditor over service not performed. The $57 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n. relates to collect long-\ndistance telephone charges from Mexico made to her home telephone when no one\nwas at home. She spoke by telephone with her long-distance carrier about the charges\non several occasions. Her calls led to the removal of one call, but not the other calls.\nShe cancelled her service with this long-distance telephone carrier, which is not the\nlisted creditor. The actual bill is listed as a debt to her local telephone carrier because\nthe long-distance carrier\u2019s bill is included in the local telephone carrier\u2019s bill. She\n\nAE A (Copy of bank statement, dated February 14, 2008 through March 13, 2008) at 2; AE C (Copy of bank\n7\nstatement, dated January 16, 2008 to February 14, 2008) at 1; Tr. 53-60.\nAE E through AE J; Tr. 22.\n8\n5\ncontinues her telephone service with the telephone carrier identified as the creditor and\nregularly pays her bill.7\nApplicant enjoys her work as a trainer. Her employer describes her trainer skills\nas valuable because she demonstrates remarkable adaption skills in her various trainer\nroles. Former employers provide very favorable recommendations on her work skills\nand ethics, as do friends and former professors. When she learned that she would be\nunable to do the security segment of her trainer job, she found other employment which\nenables her to provide her family with basic necessities including food and housing.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Towards the end of her long-term relationship, Applicant and her\nsignificant other accumulated delinquent credit card debt. She attempted to pay the\ndebt, but eventually defaulted on the obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nIn my May 14, 2008 decision, I made the following finding at AG \u00b6 20(e): \nApplicant did not recognize many of the debtors listed in the SOR,\nalthough at the hearing, when the original creditor was identified, she did\nrecognize the debt. When she did not recognize two debts, she\nchallenged the validity with the credit reporting companies as shown by\nher January 2008 credit report.  AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\n\n7\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d partially applies.\nBoth the Appeal Board and Department Counsel interpreted this finding as more\nencompassing that it was. I specifically discussed two debts challenged by Applicant in\nthe facts and my analysis, challenges which are reflected on the January 23, 2008\ncredit report submitted by Department Counsel (p.3). I did not discuss challenges to any\nothers debts. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(3) could only be partially applicable and applies to the two\ndebts Applicant challenged, as verified on the January 2008 credit report. In light of the\nAppeal Board\u2019s conclusion that none of mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\u2019s\nold debts are ongoing, Applicant has not met her burden of proving mitigation under AG\n\u00b6 20(a)-(f). I will, however, consider whether, under all the evidence of record, she has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts are a\nserious problem. During her long-term relationship, continuous and steady income\nremained elusive because her significant other worked sporadically. Although she also\nworked, she did not work continuously as she had young children at home and little\nincome for child care expenses. She always paid the mortgage payment, which assured\nhousing for her children, and the car payments, which guaranteed transportation was\navailable for work. Her financial problems first became unmanageable when her\nsignificant other started obtaining more credit cards than needed, then charged\nunnecessarily. She also used the cards for family needs, such as clothes, gas and other\nitems needed for daily living, not extravagant living. She initially paid the minimum or\nmonthly payments on the bills. Over time, however, the bills began to mount. When she\n\n8\nended her relationship, she tried, but could not continue making payments on the credit\ncard debt, because she received no financial support from her significant other and he\nrefused to pay any of the debt. (See AG & 2(a)(1)-(3).) \nApplicant obtained employment in 2000 and has worked steadily since this time.\nHer income provided basic needs, but left little money to pay her creditors. She returned\nto school, eventually earning an associates degree. With her additional education skills,\nshe sought better paying employment in order to provide for her children. Her credit\nreports show no outstanding debt from her education. See AG \u00b62(a)(6).\nApplicant became the sole financial provider for her three children when she\nended her long-term relationship with their father. In determining how to use her limited\nresources, she made decisions which provided her children with their basic needs, such\nas livable housing, food and clothes. To meet these needs, Applicant needed\ntransportation to and from work since the rural area where she lives lacks public\ntransportation. She has purchased and paid for two used cars.  Her two recent, small\ndebts arose when she disputed the charges, one for services she did not receive and\none for telephone calls not made by her family. On her own, Applicant has paid her bills\nin a timely manner and managed her limited financial resources prudently. She currently\nworks two jobs, one is part-time and the other averages between 32 and 40 hours a\nweek at a wage just above the minimum wage. Her net monthly income from both jobs\naverages $1,500. At the time of the hearing, her monthly expenses averaged $1,252.\nSince April, gasoline prices have risen dramatically, effecting not only the cost of gas for\ncars, but the cost of food, clothes, laundry soap, and other basics of life. Her basic living\nexpenses have increased at least $100 a month, leaving very limited money to pay old\ndebts. \nIn the last eight years, Applicant had to make choices about using her scarce\nresources. She always made financial decisions which favored providing for the needs\nof her children. She made an effort to pay the credit card debt incurred during her long-\nterm relationship, but ultimately decided that she needed to start fresh financially. To\nachieve financial stability, she stopped her payments on her credit debts, which are now\ndelinquent and the issue before me. Since that time, Applicant has undergone\nsignificant behavioral changes. She works steadily and consistently. She is a reliable\nand dependable employee. She pays her current bills and limits the amount of credit on\nher credit cards. She pays her bills and fights with creditors over bills she does not\nbelieve she owes. Her current resources leave her with little money to pay old debt. To\nassume she can pay old debt because she pays current debt is unrealistic based on her\ncurrent limited finances. Should she assume responsibility for repayment of her old\ndebts, she would force herself into financial chaos. She would be forced into choosing\nwhich bills should be paid each month and which bills should be ignored. Currently, she\ntimely pays her monthly bills. Given the age of her old debts, a bankruptcy filing to\neliminate these debts would wreck havoc on her much improved commercial credit\nworthiness and actually hinder her ability to manage her life when emergencies\nexpenses occur and credit is needed.   \n\n9\nSeven years ago Applicant made a decision to start over financially and not to\nmake any further payments on the credit debts created by her and her significant other.\nUnder the State law where she resides, a creditor has six years to initiate legal action to\nrecover unpaid debts. See  State Code. Ann. \u00a744-501. Applicant\u2019s creditors failed to do\nso, thus, waiving any rights to collect these debts forever. Since all of Applicant\u2019s debts,\nexcept SOR allegations 1.m and 1.n, are barred from civil suit, any civil action to\nrecover these unpaid debts will be dismissed under the statute of limitations. These\nstatutes are longstanding and well-settled law in all 50 states, and are an affirmative\ndefense. Under federal law, actions, including collection of unpaid taxes by the Internal\nRevenue Service, are barred when the statute of limitations or other specific statutory\ntimes lines for the exercise of legal rights have expired. \nA  State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of\napplication of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy\nconsiderations in that they stimulate activity, punish\nnegligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability \nto \nhuman \naffairs. \nThe \ncornerstone \npolicy\nconsideration underlying statutes of limitations is the\nlaudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in\nlitigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide\npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of\ntime, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs\nfrom sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations are,\nindeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nThe Appeal Board has held that the statute of limitations can not be applied to\nshow a good faith resolution of debts, a position with which I agree. However, given our\ncourts and legislatures long recognized purposes for statutes of limitations and in this\ncase, the expiration of the time to seek recovery of monies owed, the characterization of\nApplicant\u2019s old, unpaid debts as ongoing is troublesome. She incurred these debts over\nseven years ago. She not only has not increased the amount of these debts, she has\nnot incurred any new unpaid debt, which would reflect an ongoing problem with financial\nand debt management. The question here is whether Applicant can be coerced,\npressured, or induced to betray secrets of the United States because of her old, unpaid\ndebts. She cannot, as she is no longer legally liable for the debts. The fact that these\ndebts are very old and not collectible under state law does not negate her past conduct\nin not paying her outstanding debts, a factor I have considered. \nShe acts responsibly in all aspects of her life. Her current finances are good. She\nhas no criminal record and her children are doing well. She has focused her attention on\n\n10\nproviding a stable domestic environment for her family. She goes to work when\nscheduled and does her assigned duties. Over the years, she has lacked sufficient\nresources to pay her old credit card debts in full. Until 2001, she made payments on the\ndebts incurred during her long relationship. Financial hardship forced her to make\ndifficult decisions on how to resolve these debts. She chose to default on these debts,\nwhich enabled her to pay basic and necessary living expenses. In the last seven years,\nshe has yet to achieve an income level which would allow her to pay these old,\nuncollectible debts without creating more financial difficulties for herself. (See AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8).) Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are paid B it is whether\nher financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security\nclearance. An alcoholic who remains sober for three or more years and a drug user who\nremains drug free for two or more years is considered rehabilitated. Given Applicant has\nshown the ability to live within her limited income and stay out of debt for over six years,\nshe has rehabilitated her attitude and behavior towards the acquisition of excessive\ndebt. Security concerns are not raised because of these old debts. She has\ndemonstrated that she is a reliable and responsible individual. (See AG & 2(a)(1), (7)-\n(9).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 8, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on April 1, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 2, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled \nMay 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \non April 24, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. Department Counsel also submitted a graph summarizing \nthe debts in the SOR and which exhibits support each allegation. Applicant did not \nobject and the summarization was accepted as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf, called three witnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough D, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until May 8, 2008, to submit additional matters through Department \nCounsel. Applicant submitted six pages of documents which were marked AE E though \nI, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked HE II. The \nrecord closed on May 8, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n1, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.r. She denied the remaining allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. She is on unpaid leave from her defense contractor \nemployer pending the outcome of her security clearance determination. She is attending \ncollege. She is married with two children, ages ten and four, and she has a 19-year-old \nstepdaughter.1  \n \n \nApplicant and two younger siblings were raised by a struggling single parent. Her \nmother started putting utility bills in Applicant\u2019s name before she was an adult. Applicant \nserved in the U.S. Army from 1993 through 2000. She was honorably discharged on the \nbasis of parenthood. The father of her child paid Applicant $300 per month without a \ncourt order. She finally obtained a court order in March 2007, directing the father to pay \n$513 per month and an additional $25 per month against arrears of $2,289. Between \nabout 1997 and 1999, her mother had a type of breakdown and was unable to care for \nApplicant\u2019s two younger siblings. Applicant began paying her mother\u2019s rent payments. \nEventually both younger siblings came to live with her. Her mother was a compulsive \ngambler and would gamble her money away. Her mother continued to put utility \naccounts in Applicant\u2019s name without her permission and then let the bills become \ndelinquent. Her mother was eventually incarcerated for theft. Applicant helped pay her \nmother\u2019s bail and legal bills. She chose not to prosecute her mother for identity theft.2   \n \n \nApplicant has been unemployed a number of times over the last seven years. \nShe also helped pay her stepdaughter\u2019s college tuition. She and her husband were \nmarried in the fall of 2007. Her husband took out loans of about $6,000 to pay for the \nwedding and he had about $4,000 saved which paid for the honeymoon.3  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 7, 75-79; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 41, 75-79; GE 1, 5; AE A-D. \n \n3 Tr. at 88-89; GE 1, 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR lists 25 delinquent debts totaling about $38,600. Applicant admitted to \nowing seven debts totaling approximately $20,600. Individual debts are discussed \nbelow. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1b list judgments of $5,980 and $6,801 to the same financial \ninstitution, awarded against Applicant in about September 2006. SOR \u00b6 1.q lists a debt \nof $5,105 to the same financial institution for a car voluntarily repossessed in 2002. \nApplicant admits the judgment of $6,801, but denies the other two allegations stating \nthey all represent the same debt. Applicant stated the car was a lemon and she asked \nthe finance company to repossess it. After considering all the evidence, I am satisfied \nthat the three allegations represent one debt.4  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the medical debt of $212 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. This \ndebt was incurred when Applicant was in a car accident and signed for the medical care \nof her husband\u2019s daughter. The accident occurred in January 2005, before Applicant \nmarried the girl\u2019s father. The stepdaughter received $700 from the insurance company. \nThe money was used to pay for the girl\u2019s prom and fees for her senior year in high \nschool. She told Applicant that she would pay her the money back once she started \nworking. She is no longer living with Applicant and her husband. She did not pay \nApplicant and Applicant has not paid the debt.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d of $145 to a company \ncollecting on behalf of the university where Applicant attends college, but she stated it is \nnot delinquent because the debt is in forbearance. She submitted a forbearance request \nwhich was dated December 13, 2007.6  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a debt of $181 to a company collecting on behalf of a \ntelephone company. Applicant denied owing the debt She stated she paid a deposit of \n$250 on her telephone account and it was used to pay her final bill. She submitted no \ndocumentation on this debt at the hearing. She was asked to contact the creditor and \nsubmit a copy of her final bill from the creditor. She did not address this debt in her post-\nhearing submission. She admitted owing the debt of $338, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, to a \ndifferent collection company collecting on behalf of the same telephone company. She \nhas not made any payments on this debt. She denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.u of $71, to the same collection company collecting on behalf of the same telephone \ncompany. She stated this debt is the same account as that listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g. A debt \nof $72 to a different collection company collecting on behalf of the same telephone \ncompany is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y. Applicant testified this was an account from her \nmother\u2019s state and was opened by her mother without her authorization. The $71 and \n$72 debts do not appear on the two most recent credit reports in evidence.7 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 24-25, 33, 42-45; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-5. \n \n5 Tr. at 45-49; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE G.  \n \n6 Tr. at 25-26, 49-50; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE H. \n \n7 Tr. at 51, 54, 60, 67; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the medical debt of $74, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The \nname of the creditor is not listed in the SOR, or on the credit reports submitted in \nevidence. Applicant stated she has no idea who the debt is owed to or what it is for.8 \n \n \nApplicant stated that the debt of $242 to a company collecting on behalf of a \ncheck cashing company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, was paid by a friend. Her friend \ntestified that she paid this debt in about 2002, and Applicant repaid her.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i lists a medical debt of $934, assigned to a collection company. \nApplicant testified this debt occurred when she was in the Army and she was injured in \ntraining in 1994, and taken to the hospital in an ambulance. The military would be \nrequired to pay her medical bills while she was on active duty. She stated she \nattempted to have this resolved for more than a decade and that her credit counseling \ncompany will work on having it removed from her credit report. Applicant testified that \nthe debt of $196 to the same collection company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l represents the \nsame debt with tacked on fees. She further testified that the medical debt of $772, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o also represents the same debt. The name of the creditor is not \nlisted in the SOR, or on the credit reports submitted in evidence. The credit report of \nFebruary 1, 2007, states the debt is for \u201cdentists.\u201d Applicant submitted no \ndocumentation on these debts. She admitted that she owed the $36 medical debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k.10 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $336 to a department store, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. She stated payments on this debt are coming out of her account. She was \nasked to provide documentation of the payments after the hearing. She did not address \nthis debt in her post-hearing submission. She also admitted that she owed the $428 \ndebt to a telephone company as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n.11 \n \n \nThe debt of $239, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m is to a gas utility in the city in which \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives. The city is in a different state than where Applicant resides. \nApplicant stated this is one of the utilities that her mother put in her name without her \npermission.12 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p is a debt of $2,197 owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \ndebt was paid in February 2008, by a withholding from Applicant\u2019s federal income tax \nrefund.13 \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 52-54; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n9 Tr. at 26-27, 96-98; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n10 Tr. at 27-31, 56-57; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n11 Tr. at 55-56; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n12 Tr. at 31, 57-59; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-5. \n \n13 Tr. at 31-33; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4; AE I. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $12,466 to a financial institution after an \nautomobile repossession, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r. She stated she signed the car loan in \nthe initial amount of about $24,000, which included financing costs, for her mother\u2019s car. \nHer mother paid on the loan with her Social Security payments until she was arrested \nand could not make the payments. Applicant stated she thought if her mother had a car \nthat she might not have the need to shoplift, which is how her mother funded her \ngambling.14  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t list debts of $270 and $194 to a company collecting on behalf \nof a cable provider. Applicant disputed owing these debts. She stated the debts were for \na cable box that was returned to the cable provider. The debts are listed on the credit \nreport of February 1, 2007, but not the more recent credit reports in evidence. SOR \u00b6 \n1.x lists a debt of $428 to the same cable provider through a different collection \ncompany. This debt is listed on the credit report of September 14, 2004, submitted by \nApplicant with her response to Interrogatories, and on the credit report of February 1, \n2007. It is not listed on the two recent credit reports in evidence.15 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.v lists a debt of $238 to a financial institution. SOR \u00b6 1.w lists a debt of \n$654 to a different financial institution. Applicant denied owing these two debts. She \nstated that these were government loans that were recouped from her federal income \ntax refunds. When questioned further, Applicant stated they were not government loans, \nbut they were loans that were provided only to military members and the service \nmembers sign authorizations for the companies to debit their accounts. Applicant was \nprovided the opportunity to submit documentary proof that these debts were paid \nthrough her income tax refunds. She submitted a document from the Department of the \nTreasury showing offsets of $319 and $187 in 2004 and 2005. The document \nreferences the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). The credit report of \nSeptember 14, 2004, submitted by Applicant with her response to Interrogatories, lists a \ndelinquent debt of $157 to DFAS. There is nothing to show that the offsets were for \nprivate commercial loans, as opposed to a government obligation. The debts do not \nappear on the two recent credit reports in evidence. The debts are old and would not be \nexpected to continue to be reported after seven years. Applicant\u2019s testimony that the \ndebts were paid from her income tax refunds is not credible. There was no credible \nevidence presented that these debts were paid.16 \n \n \nApplicant met with an individual in 2004, who described himself as a \u201ccredit \ncounselor.\u201d His fee was $2,500. She could not afford that much. She consulted with \nanother individual who presented himself as a bankruptcy attorney. She paid him $250 \nto start the process of declaring bankruptcy. He was not an attorney and she eventually \nreceived part of her money back. She recently contacted a credit counseling service \nthat will assist Applicant in removing items from her credit report. They also provide \n                                                          \n14 Tr. at 34-39; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n15 Tr. at 60-62, 66-67; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n16 Tr. at 62-66; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-4; AE I. \n \n\n \n6 \n \ncounseling services. She paid $600 to this company. She is unable to do anything while \nshe is unemployed, but her plan is to consolidate any debts not removed from her credit \nreport and pay $600 per month to the company to pay her debts.17 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s witnesses testified that they have never known her to do anything \nillegal or immoral. She is described as frugal and not someone living beyond her \nmeans. She is very willing to help others. They believe she is trustworthy and a good \nperson.18 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n                                                          \n17 Tr. at 23-24, 41-42, 69-72, 80, 103-106; GE 5. \n \n18 Tr. at 82-86, 95-96, 99. \n \n\n \n7 \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n8 \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes a large amount of delinquent debt. This continues to cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable.  \n \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s financial problems are related to her mother, who is a \ncompulsive gambler and a thief. Applicant was forced to care for her two younger \nsiblings. She has gone through periods of unemployment. These conditions were \nbeyond her control. She signed for a loan for about $24,000 for a car for her mother, \nwhile knowing that her mother was a compulsive gambler. She has also made no \nattempt to pay even the smallest of the debts in the SOR. She did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling. There are not clear indications that \nher financial problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not require \nboth; it only requires one or the other. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. \n \nThe only debt that was paid by Applicant was the debt owed to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, which was involuntarily withheld from Applicant\u2019s federal income tax \nrefund. Her friend paid one debt in 2002, and then was repaid by Applicant. That is \ninsufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of \nher debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted sufficient evidence that her mother opened accounts in her \nname without her permission. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and \n1.y. She stated that several medical debts were related to when she was on active duty \nin the military in 1994, and some were duplicates. She did not provide any \ndocumentation to substantiate her claim. I will credit Applicant with the potential \nduplicates, but I am unable to find AG \u00b6 20(e) applicable to all her medical debts. The \nname of the creditor for the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is not listed in the SOR, or on the \ncredit reports submitted in evidence. Applicant disputed owing that debt stating she had \nno idea who the debt was supposedly owed to. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to that medical \ndebt. Applicant disputed owing a cable provider for the return of a cable box. The debts \n\n \n9 \n \nto that cable provider are not listed on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s, 1.t, and 1.x. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s difficulties started even \nbefore she became an adult. Her mother is a compulsive gambler and a thief, leaving \nApplicant to take care of her two younger siblings. She also paid many of her mother\u2019s \nlegal fees associated with her various arrests. Additionally, she has been unemployed \non several occasions. I also considered her honorable service in the U.S. Army and her \nvery favorable character evidence. However, she made some questionable decisions \nsuch as signing for the loan of $24,000 for a car for her mother and she has made no \nreal effort to repay even her small debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.q: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.s-1.u: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.v-1.w: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.x-1.y: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn December 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 30, 2008, and requested an\nadministrative determination. He then filed a Supplemental Answer on February 29,\n2008. On March 24, 2008, the government prepared a File of Relevant Materials\n(FORM). Applicant received it on March 27, 2008, did not reply, and the case was\nassigned to me on May 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the FORM, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nJune 30, 2008\n\n2\nPreliminary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR subparagraph 1.c to read as follows:\nYou are indebted for a judgement entered against you on or about July\n2006, in the approximate amount of $367. As of November 28, 2007, this\ndebt has not been paid.\nApplicant did not file an objection, therefore, I granted the motion. The allegation, as\namended, however, is vague. Although SOR allegations need not be drafted as\nprecisely as criminal pleadings, they must, at minimum, be drafted with enough\nspecificity for the applicant to prepare a response. SOR subparagraph 1.c does not\nmeet this threshold, therefore, I have resolved it in Applicant\u2019s favor, and will not\naddress it further in the Decision.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old man with three children. One is age 17, and the age of\nthe other two is not listed in the record. He recently divorced his wife to whom he had\nbeen married for approximately ten years. Applicant served in the U.S. Marines from\n1998 through 2002. He was honorably discharged. Since 2005, he has worked as a\nsecurity guard. He has a high school education.\nIn October 1996, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The SOR alleges that\n\u201cthe bankruptcy was discharged\u201d in approximately January 1997 (subparagraph 1.a).\nAlthough Applicant admits to this allegation, it is unclear from the record whether\nApplicant\u2019s unsecured debt was discharged or whether the court dismissed the\nbankruptcy petition before granting a discharge.\nCurrently, Applicant has approximately $16,000 of delinquent debt. SOR\nsubparagraph1.b is a judgment against him for delinquent payments on a trailer home.\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife is paying this debt as part of their separation agreement (Answer at\n3 through 9).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.d through 1.l are medical expenses incurred in 2005 when\nApplicant\u2019s son injured himself playing high school football (Answer at 13). Applicant\ncontends the school should pay them (Answer at 4). He provided no evidence that he\nhas officially disputed these bills.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n are student loans. Applicant has been paying\nthese through a federal income tax garnishment (Answer at 17-18). As of January 30,\n2008, he owes $5,576 (Answer at 15).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.o and 1.p are duplicate bills representing the deficiency\nremaining from a 2001 automobile repossession. Applicant fell behind on the car note\nwhen his then-wife was hospitalized and unable to work. It remains outstanding.\n\n3\nSOR subparagraph 1.q is a delinquent electric bill. Applicant alleges he paid it in\nJuly 2007 (Answer at 5). He provided no supporting evidence.\nApplicant had another vehicle repossessed in November 2006 (Answer to SOR\nsubparagraph 1.r). It is unknown from the record whether he owes any deficiency.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nApplicant successfully demonstrated that SOR subparagraph 1.b is no longer his\nresponsibility. I resolve it in his favor. \nThe remaining delinquencies raise security concerns under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations, because \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n4\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquencies spans 12 years and includes two automobile\nrepossessions that occurred after a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. AG & 19(a), \u201can inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d apply.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\nprovided scant evidence that his delinquencies are being resolved or are under control.\nAlso, he provided no documented proof to substantiate the basis of the disputed\ndelinquencies, and the record does not indicate he has undergone financial counseling.\nI conclude the negative security inferences generated by the repetitive and ongoing\nnature of his financial delinquencies outweigh any positive inference generated by the\nfact that some of the delinquencies may have been caused by circumstances beyond\nhis control. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nEvaluating this case using the whole person factors, particularly, the seriousness\nof the problem, and its recurrent nature, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is\ndenied.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d -1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.q - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
