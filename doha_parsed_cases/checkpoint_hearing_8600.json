On March 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 18, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 22, 2009. On June 3, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for June 17, 2009. The case was heard on that \ndate. At hearing, Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement of \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the \nDirective. (Tr at 9) The Government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 7 without objection.

Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b61.r, and  \nadmits all of the remaining SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old sharepoint developer employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since January 2009. From July 1986 to May 1999, he served on \nactive duty in the United States Army. He separated with an honorable discharge with \nthe rank of Sergeant First Class (E-7). His career field was Special Forces. He was \ninjured on two occasions while on active duty.

(Tr at 4-6, 19-20; Gov \n1; Gov 5) \n   \nOn September 9, 2005, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) He disclosed a bankruptcy filed in April \n2005, in response to section 27 on his questionnaire. A subsequent background \ninvestigation confirmed that Applicant had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13.  \nApplicant initially paid $200 a month towards the Chapter 13 plan. Applicant accepted a \njob in another state that increased his income.  He also failed to list his $650 monthly \nVA disability payment as income on his initial bankruptcy paper work. The Bankruptcy \nCourt increased his monthly payments to $800.  Applicant claims that he was unable to \nmake this payment. As a result, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed due to \nn o n p a y m e n t  i n  J u n e  2 0 0 6 .  ( T r  a t  3 6 - 3 8 , 4 5 - 4 8 ; G ov  2 ; G o v  6  a t  1 ) \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation disclosed the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $2,983 account owed to an apartment complex that was placed \nfor collection in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1); a $2,917 account that \nwas placed for collection in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1); a $220 gas \nbill that was placed for collection in July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1); and a \n$91 account owed to an apartment complex that was placed for collection in August \n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1).  \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $95 medical account that was placed \nfor collection in March 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1); a $3,274 credit card \naccount that was charged off in October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 3 at 10; Gov 6 at 2; Gov \n7 at 2); a $582 credit card account that was charged off February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: \nAnswer to SOR); a $1,299 account owed to an apartment complex (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at \n\n \n3 \n \n \n6); and a $211 telephone account that was placed for collection in December 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 6 at 2). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $607 cable television account that was \nplaced for collection in October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 7 at 1); a $455 credit card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 7 at 2); an $8,729 bank signature loan account that was placed \nfor collection in October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 2); a $16,805 debt \nowed after an automobile repossession (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 3 at 10); a $1,086 delinquent \nelectronics store account (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 3 at 10; Gov 7 at 5); and a $127 account. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 3 at 10) \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $244 credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.q: \nGov 3 at 10; Gov 6 at 5; Gov 7 at 5); a $2,184 automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.r:  Gov 3 at 10; \nGov 6 at 2-3; Gov 7 at 2); a $46,640 delinquent student loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 3 \nat 10; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 3); and a $30 debt owed to a consumer credit counseling \nagency. (SOR \u00b6 1.t: Gov 3 at 10; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant separated from the United States Army in 1998.  He accepted a job \nwith a contractor in a U.S. territory for six months. He then accepted a position with \nanother defense contractor located in the southern part of the United States. In 2002, \nApplicant and his family moved to the state where his oldest daughter (then 13) was \nliving with her mother and her step-father. Applicant decided to move there because he \nwas concerned that his daughter\u2019s step-father was abusing her and his daughter was \nalso acting up. He used the family savings and took out a loan in order to get custody of \nhis daughter. On March 1, 2003, the court awarded him custody of his daughter. (Tr at \n34; AE B) \n \nIn November 2003, Applicant\u2019s oldest daughter attempted suicide. The family \nincurred additional expenses for his daughter\u2019s counseling and medications. Applicant \nmoved the family to another state in order to get his daughter away from her mother and \nstep-father. Applicant and his second wife began to have marital problems. On June 3, \n2005, they divorced. Their divorce agreement indicates Applicant and his wife had a \n$1,500 deficit each month. Applicant agreed to be responsible for the marital debts. The \ncourt ordered Applicant to pay monthly child support of $1,581.32. Applicant claims that \nhe put his family first over his bills. He made sure his child support was paid before \nanything else. (Tr at 35-36, 41; AE A) \n  \n In July 2005, Applicant was working as a contractor and did not think that his \ncontract would be renewed. He accepted a job in another state. The company that hired \nhim paid his moving expenses. In return, he agreed to work for the company for one \nyear. He left the company\u2019s employment after 11 months. The company is attempting to \ncollect the $2,917 amount paid to Applicant for moving expenses since he did not work \nfor the company for one year as promised. (Tr at 52-53; SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant was laid off. He was unemployed for a month and a half. \nHe found another job in May 2007 but at a lesser salary. After four months, his salary \n\n \n4 \n \n \nincreased to his previous salary. In December 2008, he moved back to where his ex-\nwife and two younger children reside in order to be closer to his children. (Tr at 39-41)  \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He has not arranged \npayment plans towards any of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Tr at 60.) He intends to \navoid filing for bankruptcy. He hopes to have his child support payments lowered but \nhas not begun proceedings to do so because he does not want to alienate his ex-wife. \n(Tr at 40-41.) \n \nOn July 29, 2008, Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency. He was \nunable to enter into a repayment agreement because his expenses were approximately \n$1,067 over his net monthly income of $5,388. (Gov 3 at 9-10) \n \nApplicant\u2019s second ex-wife testified on his behalf. She has known Applicant since \n1991. They were married for 15 years.  They began to experience financial problems \nwhen they gained custody of Applicant\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage. After the \ndivorce in 2005, the financial issues became more difficult. During the first year of the \ndivorce, Applicant was late on his child support a couple times. She almost got evicted \nonce. She states that Applicant always makes sure that the needs of his children are \nmet. He is very close to his children. She describes Applicant as loyal and honest. She \nstates that he would not jeopardize his livelihood or his children\u2019s livelihood. (Tr at 27-\n33) \n \nA personal friend and co-worker of Applicant\u2019s has known him for over 10 years. \nHe and Applicant were co-workers at various defense contractors. He and Applicant \ncurrently work at the same company but in different divisions. He has daily interaction \nwith Applicant. He describes Applicant as extremely professional and security \nconscious. He socializes with Applicant outside of work. He has never seen Applicant \nlose control. (Tr at 21-24) \n \nApplicant earned $100,000 a year in his previous job. His annual income has \ndecreased to $80,000 in his current job. (Tr at 71)   \n \nHis awards and decorations received during his active duty service with the Army \ninclude the Army Commendation Medal (3rd Award); the Army Achievement Medal (2nd \nAward); the Army Good Conduct Medal (4th Award); the National Defense Service \nMedal; the Noncommissioned Officer\u2019s Professional Development Ribbon with Numeral \n2; the Army Service Ribbon; the Overseas Service Ribbon; the Expert Marksmanship \nQualification Badge with Rifle Bar; the Expert Infantryman Badge; Master Parachutist \nBadge; the Special Forces Tab; the Honduran Military Airborne Badge; the Paraguayan \nAir Force Parachutist Badge; and the Venezuelan Parachutist Badge. (Gov 5)  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nApplicant has 19 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $88,579. Of that \namount, approximately $46,640 relate to student loan debts. While some mitigating \nfactors apply to Applicant\u2019s case, most of the delinquent debts are the result of poor \nfinancial management. Applicant\u2019s income should be sufficient to meet his expenses, \nyet, he has spent more than he has earned for several years.  \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent accounts remain outstanding. While he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nMarch 2005, the case was dismissed for nonpayment in June 2006. He has made no \nattempt to resolve his delinquent accounts, including considering whether to file a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy since that time. He continued to incur delinquent accounts. His \nexcessive financial problems raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and \ngood judgment.  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant incurred \nsignificant expenses when he sought custody of his daughter in March 2003. He \nincurred additional expenses dealing with his oldest daughter\u2019s emotional problems. His \ndivorce in 2005 added a further strain on his finances.  He had a brief period of \nunemployment in 2007. This explains some of the debts that Applicant incurred. The \nnext question to be asked is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. I cannot conclude that Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances because he made no attempt to resolve his delinquent accounts. After \nhis Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2006, he continued to incur \ndelinquent debt.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency on July 29, \n2008. He never followed through with any suggestions made by the agency. \nConsidering the extensive amount of debt, his financial issues are unlikely to be \nresolved in the near future.   \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant applied for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2005, the case was dismissed in June 2006 because \nof nonpayment. He has made no attempt to resolve any of his delinquent debts since \nthat time. He has not initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his overdue accounts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nservice in the United States Army. I considered the favorable comments of Applicant\u2019s \nwitnesses, including his ex-wife. I considered the expenses Applicant incurred when he \ngained custody of his oldest daughter. While I commend Applicant\u2019s efforts to provide \nfor his children first, his delinquent debts were not solely incurred based on \ncircumstances beyond his control.  Poor financial planning and budgeting contributed to \nhis financial problems. If he followed a strict budget, his annual income is sufficient to \nmeet his expenses. Applicant has not established a plan to resolve his delinquent \naccounts.  Applicant is an articulate and bright man. However, his financial situation is \nstill precarious. He needs to consider all of his options towards resolving his delinquent \naccounts and perhaps will qualify for a security clearance in the future. At this time, \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 52 and divorced. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and, therefore, at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 6, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing on\nNovember 13, 2007. (Government Exhibit 1.) On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 6, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June\n29, 2009. This case was assigned to me on July 1, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on July 14, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 10, 2009.\nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A\n\n2\nthrough H, which were also received without objection. Applicant asked that the record\nremain open for the receipt of additional documents. The Applicant submitted Applicant\nExhibit I on October 8, 2009, and it was admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ncorrected copy of the transcript of the hearing on October 5, 2009. The record closed on\nOctober 8, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 52 and divorced. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and, therefore, at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.f.,\n1.g., and 1.h. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denies the\nremaining subparagraphs in the SOR.\nApplicant testified that the majority of his financial problems occurred in\nconnection with the divorce from his ex-wife, which occurred in 2004. This was followed\nby a period of unemployment and underemployment. Specifically, in August 2006 the\ncompany the Applicant used to work for lost a Government contract and he lost his job.\nAfter a year, he was able to obtain employment with a different Government contractor.\n(Government Exhibit 1; Transcript at 51-62.) \nApplicant received financial counselling through the military in early 2008.\n(Applicant Exhibit A.) He began working with a bankruptcy law firm starting in July 2008.\nHe retained the firm, and they filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 30, 2009. Through\nno fault of the Applicant, he did not receive a Discharge in bankruptcy until September\n23, 2009. (Government Exhibit 3 at 5-13; Applicant Exhibits D, I at 3, 5-14; Transcript at\n65-68.) As part of the bankruptcy process, the Applicant successfully completed two\nfinancial counselling courses.\nThe following debts were included in the Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 filing: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b.,\n1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., and 1.q. Applicant received a discharge\nfor all of these debts. (Government Exhibits 7, 9; Applicant Exhibit I at 3, 5-14.)\nThe current status concerning the other debts in the SOR is as follows:\n1.c.\nApplicant admitted that he owed $5,963 for a past due credit card account.\nHe has paid this debt. A credit report dated July 25, 2008, confirms this debt was paid\nand is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit C at 4; Transcript at 41.)\n\n3\n1.d. and 1.k. Applicant denied that he owed $114 and $426 for two debts to\ndifferent mobile phone companies. Applicant stated that most of the mobile phone bills\nwere incurred by his ex-wife without his permission. He filed disputes concerning these\ndebts with the credit agencies, or placed the debts in his bankruptcy. (Transcript at 42-\n44.) Several of the debts included in the Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy concern\nthese particular mobile telephone companies. These particular debts appear in a credit\nreport from November 2007. (Government Exhibit 2.) They do not appear after that.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that these debts have been\nresolved either by dispute, or by being included in the Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy.\n1.m.\nApplicant denied that he owed $139 for a debt to a mobile phone\ncompany. This is Applicant\u2019s telephone, and he submitted his most recent mobile phone\nbill to show that he is current on that account. (Applicant Exhibit I at 15-16; Transcript at\n48-49.)\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. His most recent credit report does\nnot show any past due indebtedness. (Government Exhibit 9; Transcript at 69-73.)\nApplicant retired after a successful military career. (Applicant Exhibit E.)  He\nsubmitted his most recent employee evaluation. His overall rating was \u201cOutstanding/Far\nExceeds Expectations.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit G.) Finally, Applicant submitted letters of\nrecommendation from two work supervisors. They describe the Applicant as\n\u201cconscientious and honest,\u201d and \u201cdedicated, and committed.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit F.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\n\n5\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, had substantial past-due debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nApplicant=s financial difficulties arose primarily because of a contentious divorce,\ncombined with a bout of underemployment and unemployment. He documented serious\nand long-standing attempts to resolve his past due debts. The record shows that he has\ndischarged the vast majority of his past due debts in bankruptcy, as well as paying other\ndebts, and disputing those that were not his. At all times he has acted responsibly.\nThese two mitigating conditions apply.\nApplicant received financial counselling through the military family support\nsystem. His advisor recommended a bankruptcy. He retained a law firm, which filed a\nChapter 7 for him after confirming he met the means test. His debts were properly\ndischarged. Accordingly, since he has resolved his debts, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable.\nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He is able to pay his current\nindebtedness in a timely manner. I find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n\n6\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had some\nfinancial problems, but his current financial condition is stable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), I\nhave considered the facts of the Applicant\u2019s debt history. As stated at length above,\nmuch of this was brought about because of a divorce, and a period of unemployment\nand underemployment. Based on the record, I find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, I find that there is little to no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is\nno likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.q.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On January 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, which are effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a February 27, 2009, response, Applicant admitted all 17 of the allegations set\nforth in the SOR. Each allegation concerned a different delinquent debt belonging to\nApplicant. She later requested a hearing on the matter. DOHA assigned the case to me\non June 1, 2009. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a hearing date of June\n24, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on June 4, 2009. I convened the\nhearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and offered one document, which was\naccepted without objection as exhibit (Ex.) A. She was given through July 17, 2009, to\nJuly 29, 2009\n\n This date was chosen to provide Applicant with additional time to submit her first bankruptcy payment,\n      1\nscheduled for July 15, 2009.

Based on a review of the testimony, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her burden regarding the security concerns\nraised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old management assistant who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since November 2007. Applicant earned a high school diploma.\nSeparated, Applicant is the mother of two children, ages 26 and 17.

Applicant later married the man, a painter, but the relationship was\n\u201cunsteady\u201d and they eventually separated.  She receives no financial support from him.\n2\nApplicant worked for one company from June 2004 through February 2005, but\nquit because she found its business practices to be unethical. She then worked for a\npublic utility from February 2005 until February 2006, when she was laid off. She\nreceived unemployment compensation for a period before eventually starting her\ncurrent job in November 2007. \u201cI was very fortunate to get the job that I have. . . .  It\naffords me the living expenses that I need, but [those expenses] takes (sic) all I make. .\n. .\u201d  While the salary is stable, she recognized that she needed more income to meet\n3\nher obligations.  This need became more urgent when she received the January 2009\n4\nSOR. In early June 2009, she met with an attorney who advised her to file for Chapter\n13 bankruptcy protection. She sincerely wants to \u201cget on the right track the right way\u201d\nand resolve her financial problems. Her bankruptcy petition was filed and contains the\n\n W ithout evidence to the contrary, the debts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, amounting to\n      5\nabout $800, are either not listed in the petition or were subsumed into other accounts and now unidentifiable\nbased on the petition and credit reports.

Payments are scheduled to be made for the next 36 months.\n6\nAt issue in the SOR are 17 delinquent debts. Most were incurred while Applicant\nwas unemployed and after Applicant\u2019s first husband left her in 2002.  No payments\n7\nwere made on any of the debts in the past year.  She knew about many of the debts,\n8\nalthough she never consulted a credit report.  She blames her lack of progress on\n9\n\u201cprocrastination.\u201d  She regrets having been \u201cirresponsible,\u201d but notes she did not have\n10\nthe income to make any progress on her debts.  At one point in the past, she met with\n11\na man from her church who helps people with their finances. He advised her that she\ndid \u201cnot have the income necessary\u201d to work with him.  He also advised her not to\n12\ncontact any of her creditors unless she had the money to make payments.  She initially\n13\nresisted the temptation to file bankruptcy, but eventually felt it \u201cwas the only option that\n[she] had at the time to clear [her] record and start over.  She stated: \u201cI am determined\n14\nto do it the right way, the legal way, so that was my only option as far as I\u2019m concerned\nto get these debts cleared, because I don\u2019t foresee any extra income coming in, other\nthan my employment [salary] at this time.\u201d  \n15\nApplicant currently earns about $2,200 a month. She receives no portion of her\nestranged husband\u2019s income. She receives no child support. Her monthly expenses are\napproximately $2,216.

She enjoys her current work and\nnotes that some of her past licenses required that she be bonded.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n19\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n20\n21\n\n Id.\n      22\n Id.\n      23\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      24\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n22\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.23\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.24\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nBetween 2000 and 2007, Applicant acquired an unwieldy amount of debt which\nbecame delinquent, resulting in her recent bankruptcy filing. These facts are sufficient\nto raise financial considerations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d). With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome\nthe case against her and mitigate security concerns. \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt was the result of several significant events that\noccurred between 2000 and 2007. Her transition to financial services required an\nunexpected reduction in income. Her first husband abruptly walked out on her one day\nwithout notice. After her divorce, she married a man who proved to be unreliable and\nfrom whom she is currently estranged. Corporate business decisions caused Applicant\nto rely on unemployment compensation for two significant periods. While these\nsituations can be said to have given rise to much of her debt, they do not explain her\ninaction regarding her debts during her times of employment. Applicant testified that\nshe was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cprocrastinated\u201d in addressing these debts. Consequently,\nfinancial considerations mitigating condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) does not\napply. \nApplicant solicited financial advice and assistance from a member of her church,\nbut their meeting was less than productive. More recently, however, she met with a\nbankruptcy attorney who has since filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on her\nbehalf. Her first payment of 36 monthly payments was to begin on or by July 15, 2009,\nalthough no evidence of such payment was submitted by July 17, 2009. Regardless,\nsome progress has been made. Further, Applicant appreciates the fact she was\npreviously irresponsible and is now contrite. Consequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) and FC MC \u00b6 20(d)\n(\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d) apply. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor, she is a credible and mature professional. She\ncompleted high school and earned her diploma. Applicant devoted a number of years to\ngovernment service. She has raised two children and now cares for both her children\nand her grandchild. Applicant regrets having procrastinated in addressing her debts.\nSpeaking against Applicant is the fact that her debt, some of it reaching back to\n2000, remained unaddressed until several months after the January 2009 SOR was\nissued and it remained unaddressed until slightly before the June 24, 2009, hearing.\nAlthough her bankruptcy filing is a legitimate method for addressing her debts, her\nprocrastination left no time to create a demonstrable pattern of regular payment or a\ntrack record of reliable payment minimizing the possibility the petition might later be\ndismissed. While a year of regular payments on a 36-month plan would go a long way\ntoward showing such diligence and commitment, there is no proof of any payments\nhere. Consequently, there is no persuasive evidence that Applicant has truly made\nsignificant progress in actually satisfying her debts. As noted above, any reasonable\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information\nmust be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information. With security\nconcerns regarding her finances unmitigated, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008). The record demonstrates that the Judge addressed the evidence which Applicant submitted in her own behalf. However, the Judge also considered record evidence that Applicant does not maintain a budget, that she has not followed through on promises to address her debts, and that she has not had financial counseling. The Judge also noted that Applicant\u2019s claim to have disputed various debts was not supported by corroborating evidence. The Board concludes that the Judge has \u201carticulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for her",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied. \n \nOn February 27, 2009 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing March 20, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. I was assigned the case on May 7, 2009. Applicant was \nnotified by email on May 18, 2009 that her hearing was scheduled for June 3, 2009 by \n1 \n \nJune 15, 2009\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nvideo-teleconference. DOHA issued a formal Notice of Hearing on May 21, 2009, and I \nconvened the hearing on the scheduled date. Applicant affirmed receipt of the email \nnotice and was ready to proceed, waiving any potential delay. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on \nher own behalf and offered Exhibits (AE) A through L, which were admitted without \nobjection.1 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 11, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, I.h, 1.i, and 1.j and denied the remaining allegations. Her admissions to the \nallegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and works for a federal contractor in administrative \nsupport. She married in 2005 and her husband is in the military. They have no children, \nbut she has a six-year-old stepdaughter. Applicant earned a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in 1994 and a master of business administration in 2000.2  \n \nApplicant has accumulated approximately $30,770 in delinquent debts. She \naccumulated approximately $200,000 in student loan debt that she stated was either \ndeferred or in forbearance. She has only made some small payments towards the \ninterest of these debts sometime between 2000 and 2003. A couple of months ago she \nmade another request for forbearance that extends to approximately August or \nSeptember of 2009. She believes her monthly payment will be more than $1,000 a \nmonth. She plans on using her income to pay this debt. The debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \n($5,846), 1.f ($6,023) and 1.g ($5,761) are student loan debts that are alleged to be in \ncollection status that Applicant stated are now in forbearance. It is difficult to determined \nwhat the current status of these debts are as the credit report has contradictory \ninformation, showing both deferral and collection. In any event, Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation to confirm the status of these debts.3 \n \nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($945) and 1.b ($1,044) are to the same creditor. \nIn February 2008 Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator regarding these delinquent debts. She advised the investigator she \ndisputed the accounts because she did not believe she held accounts with the creditor. \nShe indicated she believed these were fraudulent accounts opened in her name and \nwas not going to pay them. She planned on contacting the creditors and credit bureaus \nas soon as possible to dispute the accounts and have them removed from her credit \nreport. At her hearing she testified she had contacted the creditor, but the account was \nnot removed from her credit report. She provided a copy of the creditor\u2019s demand for \n \n1 Many of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were unintelligible and had handwritten notes on them that were \nillegible and were impossible to determine which debt she was referring to. I consider the documents to \nthe best of my ability, but without specific clarification they were, in most cases, unhelpful.  \n \n2 Tr. 109. \n \n3 Tr. 32, 65-74; GE 6.  \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \npayment letter which included her handwritten notes on the letter that she faxed back to \nthe creditor telling them not to contact her. She has not taken any other action regarding \nthese debts since June 2008. She stated she believed these debts are a result of \nidentity theft because she never had an account with the creditor. She did not file a \npolice report or dispute them with the credit bureau. She said she would file a report \nwhen she returns to the U.S.4  \n \nApplicant stated she believes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. ($1,221) is the same as the \ndebt in \u00b6 1.k ($614). She failed to provide substantiation for why she believes they are \nthe same. She also stated she believes these debts are fraudulent and she \u201cneeds to \nfile a police report.\u201d In her OPM interview she believed there was a different debt that \nwas the same as the one in \u00b6 1.k. She has now retracted that and believes it is \u00b61.c and \n\u00b6 1.k that are the same creditors. She acknowledged in her OPM interview the debt in \u00b6 \n1.k is a credit card debt. She now believes that because it is not the debt she originally \nthought it was, but that these are fraudulent entries and she plans on filing a police \nreport when she returns to the U.S. for vacation in several weeks. She has been aware \nof her dispute since August 2008 and has not disputed the debts with the credit \nbureau.5  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($168) Applicant stated she paid but did not retain any \ndocuments. She admitted she was delinquent on paying the debt for about a year and \nshe has been disputing the debt. The debt was for phone services. Applicant did not \nprovide documented proof regarding her position.6  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($474) is a credit card debt that Applicant stopped paying \nsometime in 2006. She knows she owes the money, but did not have the money to pay \nit at the time. She acknowledged the debt at her OPM interview in February 2008 and \nagreed to pay the debt in full. She planned on making payment arrangements and \nsettling the account no later than October 2008. She has not made any payments on \nthe debt, but stated she contacted the creditor in February 2009. She plans on paying \nthe debt in a couple of months.7  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.i ($7,538) is for a repossessed car. In her OPM interview she \nagreed her vehicle was repossessed, but disputed that she owed any money to the \ncreditor. She acknowledged she got behind in her payments on the loan when she and \nher husband moved. She received a letter from the finance company advising her she \nowed the alleged amount. However, she did not believe she owed anything after the \nvehicle was repossessed because she no longer had the vehicle. In her interview she \nfelt she owed the creditor nothing and had no intention of ever paying anything further \non this account at any time in the future. At her hearing she stated she was two months \nbehind on payments when the vehicle was repossessed. She stated she contacted the \n \n4Tr. 33-38, 49-58; GE 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9; AE B. \n  \n5 Tr. 58-62; GE 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n \n6 Tr. 62-65. \n \n7 Tr. 74-81; GE 3, 4 and 6 \n\n4 \n \n                                                          \ncreditor, but has not resolved the debt. She stated she would pay the debt when she \ncould get to it. She stated she needed to contact the creditor and see if they sold the \nvehicle and how much she owed.8  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,131) is a state tax lien. In her OPM interview Applicant \nbelieved the lien was for taxes owed on a vehicle purchase. She admitted that she was \nbehind in paying her state income taxes at one point and paid $300 toward the back \ntaxes and believes she owes a remainder of $500. She did not believe the tax lien on \nthe SOR was for state income taxes, but thought it was for the vehicle. She stated she \nplanned on contacting the state within a couple of months of her interview to follow up \nand to pay the lien in full via a payment arrangement. She was not sure when it would \nbe paid in full. At her hearing she stated she believed the tax was a city income tax. The \ntax lien was filed in March 2004. She believed that the tax was being withheld from her \npay until she moved to a new job and the new employer did not withhold the tax. She \nwas unaware the new employer was not withholding the taxes. She stated she became \naware of the tax lien in 2007 and made an arrangement to pay $150 a month. She \nstated she made a $75 payment in August 2008 and has not made any other payments. \nShe stated she has contacted the state and advised them she will pay the amount in full \nin July 2009.9  \n \nApplicant does not have a budget. She handles the money in the family. She has \nnot had any financial counseling. She has no savings and about $400 in cash at home. \nHer husband\u2019s rank is E-4. She believes at the end of the month, they have \napproximately $300 to $500 in expendable income. Her husband was deployed during \nthe past year. While deployed he earned tax-free income and special pay. She \nexperienced periods of unemployment. She stated she was unemployed during 2007 \nand began her current job in January 2008. She was unemployed for about a year in \n2002 to 2003. She worked for Company A from 2003 or 2004 to 2005 and left because \nof her husband\u2019s military move.10 She experienced periods of unemployment from \nDecember 2005 to April 2007, but did work July 2006 to December 2006. She stated \nshe has a plan to work on her debts and has cleared up things on her credit report.11  \n \nApplicant testified she had retrieved credit bureau reports from 2005, 2006 and \n2007 and was provided a credit report from the Government in 2008. Applicant is \nreturning to the U.S. for leave in June 2009. She and her husband will fund their trip \nfrom their income. She has a small amount of money in an IRA ($400) and a 401K \naccount ($1,000). Applicant earns approximately $3,800 a month after taxes are \nwithheld.12  \n \n8 Tr. 32-33, 74-81; GE 3, 4 and 6. \n \n9 Tr. 32-33, 81-92; GE 3, 7, 8 and 9. \n \n10 Tr. 112-115; Applicant had a difficult time remembering what periods of time she was \nunemployed.  \n \n11 Tr. 96-107, 113-115. \n \n12 Tr. 60-61, 94-96, 117-120. \n\n5 \n \n                                                          \nApplicant provided numerous character letters that I considered. Those writing \nletters believe her to be trustworthy, dependable, and loyal. She is considered a good \nperson with a strong work ethic, reliable and hardworking. Applicant completed over 211 \nhours of volunteer service from May 2007 to February 2009 and provided a letter from \nthe volunteer coordinator who considers her a true team player.13  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was often convoluted and confusing and lacked candor. I \ndid not find her testimony regarding her disputes with creditors or her actions to resolve \nher debts as credible. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n \n13 AE K and L. \n\n6 \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nApplicant has been aware of her delinquent debts for a significant period of time \nand although she made promises to contact creditors, pay the debts, dispute the debts, \nand file police reports about some of them, she has not taken action on them. I find the \nabove disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \n\n7 \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s OPM interview she made promises to address her delinquent \ndebts. She failed to follow through on her promises. She continues to owe the debts \nalleged. She testified that some of the delinquent debts are the result of identity theft, \nbut failed to show she filed police reports about them or formally researched the debts \nand disputed them with the creditors or credit bureaus. The most she did was make a \nhandwritten notation on a payment demand letter telling the creditor to not contact her. \nApplicant has neglected to follow through on addressing her delinquent debts and \ninstead at her hearing made new promises to take care of her debts. She has not \nreceived financial counseling. She has not made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts. \nThere are not clear indications the problem is being resolved. Applicant may have \nlegitimate disputes with certain creditors, but despite having adequate time since her \nOPM interview to formally dispute the debts, she has not. I find mitigating conditions (a), \n(c), (d) and (e) do not apply. Applicant experienced some periods of unemployment. \nHowever for mitigating condition (b) to be fully applicable she must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. There is no evidence she acted responsibly in \naddressing her delinquencies. I find mitigating condition (b) only partially applies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \n\n8 \n \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are:  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives high praise from \nthose who provided character letters. Applicant has been aware of her delinquent debts \nfor a long period of time. She has done very little to resolve them. She made promises \nto contact creditors, research and dispute different debts, but has not. She does not \nhave a budget and has not gone to any financial counseling. In the next few months she \nwill have to start repaying her student loans totaling approximately $200,000, with \nmonthly payments of $1,000. Based on her financial situation it is likely she will be \nunable to make the total monthly payments. Applicant owes a significant amount of debt \nand has failed to take action to resolve it. She made many promises in her OPM \ninterview, but did not follow through. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in Paragraph 1 of the SOR and provided additional information in support of his request for a trustworthiness determination. Applicant is 32-years old and single. Since October 2007, he has worked as an administrative assistant for a health service network.

On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 13, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 12, 2009, \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing ten \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy. Applicant received the FORM on \nFebruary 26, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. Applicant timely submitted a letter along with five attachments, to \nwhich Department Counsel had no objections. I marked the submission as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) 1 (with 11 pages), and admitted it into the record. On April 8, 2009, DOHA \nassigned the case to me. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \nParagraph 1 of the SOR and provided additional information in support of his request for \na trustworthiness determination.   \n \n \n \nApplicant is 32-years old and single. Since October 2007, he has worked as an \nadministrative assistant for a health service network. He is currently working on a \nMaster of Arts in Business Administration in order to secure a higher paying position. \n(Item 6 at 15) Other than information regarding his delinquent accounts, there is no \nother derogatory information about Applicant in the case file.  \n \n \n \nBased on an October 2007 credit bureau report (CBR), the November 2008 SOR \nalleged that Applicant owed approximately $28,923 to three credit card companies for \ndebts that began accruing in 2001. (GE 5) Applicant has resolved and paid all three \ndebts. In December 2008, he negotiated a settlement of the $6,263 delinquent debt, \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, for $658.95. He made three monthly payments of $219.65, \nbeginning on December 10, 2008. (AE 1 at 2-6) In December 2008, he negotiated a \n$2,820.08 settlement of the $14,100.42 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He made two \npayments of $1,415.04 on December 10, 2008 and January 10, 2009. (GE 3 at 4, 5; AE \n1 at 8, 9) On December 10, 2008, he resolved the $8,762 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nwith a payment of $2,200. (GE 3 at 3, 8, 9; AE 1 at 10)  \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an applicant \nshall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to \nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n4 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns, \ntwo of which may be pertinent to this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201can inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise trustworthiness concerns. Based \non a CBR and his admissions, Applicant was unable or unwilling to satisfy three debts \nthat began accumulating in 2001. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe resulting trustworthiness concerns. AG \u00b6 20 provides five conditions that could \nmitigate such concerns arising from financial considerations:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties started in 2001 and continued into 2008. Because \nthe problems have been ongoing for at least seven years and are not isolated incidents, \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  Applicant did not provide any explanation addressing the \nunderlying reasons for his financial difficulties; hence AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot apply. He did \nnot submit any documentation that he received credit counseling, but did submit proof \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay all of his delinquent debts, establishing that the \nproblem is resolved and warranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d). There \nis no record evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e).  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 32 years old. He started \nworking for a federal contractor in October 2007. Currently, he is pursuing an advanced \ndegree in order to obtain a higher paying position. According to the record, his \ndelinquent debts began accumulating in 2001. At the time the SOR was filed in \nNovember 2008, he owed approximately $28,923 to three creditors. Immediately after \nreceiving the SOR, he resolved and paid his debts by the middle of February 2009, \ndemonstrating responsible conduct and concern for his position. Other than these \ndebts, there is no other derogatory evidence in the record that raises a trustworthiness \nconcern. \n    \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position at this time. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nThis is a security clearance case in which Applicant contests the Defense\nDepartment\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense\nindustry. The record shows Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties as\nshown by 11 delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $54 to $16,340 for an\napproximate total of $42,000. The debts include $4,800 in delinquent property taxes,\nnine collection accounts, and one account charged off as a bad debt. He has not paid,\nsettled, or otherwise resolved any of the debts, and he does not have a realistic plan in\nplace to do so in the future. These circumstances create doubts about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. The record contains insufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case\nis decided against Applicant. \nNovember 25, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, Paragraph E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting evidence, which\n3\nwill be identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on April 9, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint as it detailed the factual\nbasis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for\npersonal conduct. Also, the SOR recommended submitting the case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided on the written record.2\nOn August 31, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file\n3\nof relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by him on September\n11, 2009. He then had 30 days to submit a documentary response setting forth\nobjections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. He did not respond within\nthe 30-day period. The case was assigned to me November 9, 2009. \nRulings on Procedure\nThe SOR was amended, on my own motion, to correct Applicant\u2019s social security\nnumber. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nthe same company since 1995, and he works as a system administrator. It appears that\nthis is Applicant\u2019s initial application for an industrial security clearance. \nApplicant married for the first time in 1985, and he divorced in 1999. The\nmarriage resulted in two children, born in 1990 and 1993. He married his current wife in\n2002, and they had a child in 2003. \n\n Exhibits 5, 6, and 9. \n4\n Exhibit 4. \n5\n Exhibit 7. \n6\n Exhibit 8. \n7\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties as shown by\ndelinquent accounts described in credit reports from 2007, 2008, and 2009.  The SOR\n4\nalleged 11 delinquent accounts ranging in amounts from $54 to $16,340 for an\napproximate total of $42,000. The debts include $4,800 in delinquent property taxes,\nnine collection accounts, and one account charged off as a bad debt. Applicant admitted\nthe  indebtedness when he answered the SOR. He did not present proof of repayment,\nsettlement, or otherwise resolving the debts when he answered the SOR; he did not\nreply to the FORM.\nIn August 2007, Applicant completed a security-clearance application in which he\nresponded to questions about his background, to include his financial record.  In\n5\nresponse to Question 28a, he denied having any debts more than 180 days delinquent\nin the last seven years. And in response to Question 28b, he denied currently having\nany debts more than 90 days delinquent.\nApplicant was interviewed in October 2007, as part of a background\ninvestigation.  In relevant part, he provided the following information about his financial\n6\nsituation:\n\u2022\nHis divorce resulted in a child-support payment of $600 monthly. He reported that\nthe divorce was costly, and the child-support payment has been a burden on him.\n\u2022\nAfter he remarried, his wife quit a good-paying job so she could care for her ailing\nparents who live hundreds of miles away from Applicant. This resulted in\nApplicant being the sole breadwinner in the household while attempting to\nsupport two households, pay child support, and pay travel expenses associated\nwith visiting his wife and daughter.\n\u2022\nApplicant has borrowed from his 401(k) account to supplement his income, and\nhe then had two outstanding loans that he was repaying. \n\u2022\nHis wife is unaware of the financial problems. Applicant is afraid that she would\nconsider divorce if she knew the true state of their finances.\n\u2022\nHe is unsure where he will find the money to resolve his delinquent property\ntaxes.\n\u2022\nIn general, his plan was to pay off the delinquent accounts once his child-support\nobligation ended in a couple of years. \nSubsequently, the Agency propounded written interrogatories to Applicant about\nhis finances.  He answered several but not all of the interrogatories in November 2008.\n7\nConcerning the delinquent accounts, he explained that he would make repayments\nonce his child-support obligation ended. He did not respond to questions about why he\n\n Department of Navy v.

And he indicated that he was unwilling to tell his spouse\nabout his current financial situation.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n8\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n9\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n10\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n11\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n12\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n13\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n14\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.

In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n18\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n19\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n20\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n21\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n22\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n23\n6\nThe record here shows Applicant has, judging by the credit reports, a history of\nfinancial difficulties dating back several years. His well-established history of financial\ndifficulties raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n21\n22\nGuideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish the two disqualifying\nconditions, and it suggests financial irresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six mitigating conditions as follows:  \n23\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none, either individually\nor in combination, are sufficient to mitigate and overcome the security concerns.\nApplicant receives some credit under \u00b6 20(b), because his financial difficulties are due,\nin part, to his costly divorce from his first wife and the resulting child-support obligation,\nwhich Applicant is still required to pay. These circumstances serve to extenuate or\nmitigate Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties. The credit is limited, however,\nbecause the divorce took place several years ago and supporting one\u2019s children is not\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and\n24\nmitigating conditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 15. \n25\n7\nan unexpected circumstance. Further, what is missing here is a plan of action to repay,\nsettle, or otherwise resolve Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts. Without a realistic plan and\nsome measurable progress, it is too early to tell if he will resolve his delinquent debts\nanytime soon. Looking forward, the likelihood of additional financial problems cannot be\nruled out. Indeed, both the delinquent property taxes and the 401(k) loans are red flags\nfor financial distress and instability.   \nTurning next to the personal conduct allegations, Guideline E  includes issues of\n24\nfalse statements and credible adverse information that may not be enough to support\naction under any other guideline. The overall concern is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n25\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issues here are the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to two questions on\nhis security-clearance application. He answered both questions in the negative thereby\ndenying any financial delinquencies within the relevant periods. His answers to these\nquestions were not discussed during his background interview. He did not respond to\ninterrogatories about why he failed to list any delinquent accounts in response to\nQuestions 28a and 28b of his security-clearance application. And because this case is\ndecided on the written record, my ability to assess credibility is limited. Given all the\ncircumstances and limitations of the written record, the  evidence is insufficient to\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 28a and 28b were knowingly and\nwillfully false. Accordingly, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are decided for\nApplicant. \nIn addition under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to inform his\nspouse of his financial problems as a separate basis raising security concerns. The\ntheory here is that Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to do so might make him vulnerable to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress that could be used against him to compromise\n\n See Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 16(e). \n26\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n27\n8\nclassified information.  Although not fanciful, given all the circumstances and limitations\n26\nof the written record, the evidence is insufficient to reach that conclusion. Accordingly,\nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c is decided for Applicant.\nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties create doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He did not\npresent sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. In\nreaching this conclusion, I considered the nine-factor whole-person concept  and\n27\nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion\nto obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.k:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.      \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant misused his former employer\u2019s company van and was involved in an\naccident while drunk in December 2007. He complied with all subsequent court and\nalcohol treatment requirements, and demonstrated rehabilitation and mitigation of\nresulting security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on February 19, 2008. On\nDecember 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nG (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nApril 6, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 20, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 27, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 28,\n2009, and the case was assigned to me on November 2, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice\nof Hearing on December 8, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January\n6, 2010. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through E, which were also admitted\nwithout objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on January 15, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three and denied two of the factual\nallegations concerning his alcohol consumption, and admitted the lone personal conduct\nallegation. During the hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss the\nallegation set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which Applicant had denied, because it was based on\na misinterpretation of the evidence. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the\nfollowing findings. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old mechanic, employed by a defense base-support\ncontractor for two years. He is married for the second time, with two children and one\nstepchild, ages 18, 8, and 13, respectively. He has no military service, and this is his\nfirst application for a security clearance. (GE 1 at 2, 7, 13-15, 18-20, 23, 29.)\nApplicant started drinking around 1983, at age 15. He drank beer to the point of\nintoxication once or twice a week from then until December 8, 2007. (GE 4 at 11; Tr. at\n27-28, 34-37.) During the evening of December 7, 2007, Applicant and his wife drove\nhis newly-issued company van into town to buy some hardware needed to install a\nladder rack. On the way, he received a telephone call from some friends inviting\nApplicant and his wife to join them at a bar near the hardware store for a holiday-season\nget together. They went to the bar and spent the entire evening partying with the\nfriends. Applicant never made it to the hardware store. (Tr. at 38, 42-43.)  \nApplicant and his wife left the bar around 2:00 a.m. on December 8, 2007. He\nhad not driven far when he crossed the center line and the oncoming lane of the two-\nlane road, and collided with some trees beyond the curb on the opposite shoulder. He\nwas slightly injured, but his wife bit her tongue severely enough to require hospital\ntreatment. After police responded, Applicant failed a field sobriety test. He was arrested\nfor driving under the influence (DUI). At the police station, his breath alcohol test\nreadings were .220 and .218. The legal limit is .08. (GE 2; GE 4.) \nApplicant had permission to drive the company van between home and work,\nand while working during the day. He did not have permission to use it for recreational\npurposes. Two days after his DUI arrest, the company for whom he was working fired\nhim for misuse of the company van. He obtained his current employment in February\n2008. (Tr. at 27, 38-39.)\n\n3\n On December 18, 2007, on the advice of his attorney, Applicant underwent a\nchemical dependency assessment. He was found to be alcohol dependent. (GE 4 at 10-\n14.) On February 4, 2008, he appeared in court and was granted entry into a two-year\ndeferred prosecution agreement that required five years of probation, installation of an\nignition interlock, attendance at a DUI victims panel, an alcohol assessment, and\npayment of a fine, restitution, and court costs. (GE 3.) On the same date, he enrolled in\na two-year intensive outpatient alcohol treatment program as recommended in his\nalcohol dependency assessment. He successfully completed that program shortly prior\nto his hearing, and the clinical supervisor of his treatment program reported that his\n\u201cprognosis for continued abstinence and sobriety is good.\u201d (AE A.) The court released\nhim a year early from the ignition interlock requirement in February 2009, and he has\npaid all required fines, restitution, and costs. (GE 3; GE 4 at 9; AE D; Tr. at 22-25.)\nApplicant has not consumed any alcohol since December 8, 2007, and continues to\nregularly attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings after having completed all twelve\nsteps. His intention is to continue abstaining from any alcohol consumption. (Tr. at 28,\n31-35.)\nApplicant has received significant recognition for excellent performance of his\nwork duties in his current position, including a personal letter of appreciation from the\nadmiral commanding the Navy region. Two supervisors also wrote to express their high\nopinions of his character, integrity, and work ethic. (AE E.) His demeanor during the\nhearing reflected candor, sincerity, and dedication to continuing his successful\nrehabilitation and professional efforts in support of the military mission. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n4\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DCs). The DCs supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by\nDepartment Counsel are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s admitted DUI in December 2007 supports security concerns under\nAG \u00b6 22(a). He was evaluated as alcohol dependent by the licensed chemical\ndependency professionals and clinical social workers at the alcohol assessment and\ntreatment clinics he attended, supporting application of AG \u00b6 22(e).\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns (MCs):\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s single alcohol-related DUI incident would support a finding that such\nbehavior was infrequent, although he admitted regular consumption, at times to excess\nand to the point of intoxication, during the preceding 24 years. This history of\nconsumption led to his diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 23(a) does\nnot provide conclusive mitigation standing alone. The unlikeliness of recurrence and\nreestablishment of his reliability and good judgment are supported only through his\nsuccessful rehabilitation efforts addressed in the remaining MCs. \nApplicant has not consumed any alcohol since December 8, 2007, and he has\nestablished a pattern of responsible conduct and abstinence for more than two years.\nSufficient time has passed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b), given the duration\nand nature of his history of alcohol abuse. Similarly, there is substantial and sufficient\nevidence to support mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and (d). Applicant successfully\nparticipated in, and recently completed, intensive outpatient alcohol treatment and\ncontinues active participation in AA. He has suffered no relapses and the licensed\n\n6\nchemical dependency professional serving as clinical supervisor of the treatment\nprogram gave him a good prognosis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes the DCs under this guideline. The specific Guideline E\nconcern raised by the SOR allegation as asserted by Department Counsel is:\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.  \nAlso raised are the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness issues the Appeal Board\nfound to be inherent under AG \u00b6 15. ISCR Case No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008).\nApplicant was fired from his previous job for improper personal use of a company\nvan, and involving it in the DUI incident discussed above. These acts adequately raise\nconcerns about his judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and willingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, to shift the burden to him to establish mitigation. More detailed\nwhole-person analysis will be discussed in the following section. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides personal conduct MCs. The only MCs with potential\napplicability to the foregoing security concerns are:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n\n7\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nMitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c) was partially established for the reasons discussed\nabove concerning AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant was originally using the van for valid company\nbusiness, but succumbed to the temptation to divert into personal use when invited to a\nholiday celebration by friends. He readily admitted the wrongfulness of this decision and\nconvincingly testified that he learned his lesson from it. He has convinced his present\nsupervisors of his integrity and trustworthiness, corroborating that such conduct is\nunlikely to recur. Applicant produced substantial evidence to support mitigation under\nAG \u00b6 17(d) as well. His misuse of the van, and the bad judgment involved, were largely\nalcohol-related problems, for which he has demonstrated successful treatment and\nrehabilitation. These steps have also eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation or duress, because the nature and extent of his former problem have been\nrevealed to those whose good opinion he values, and successfully addressed through\ntreatment. AG \u00b6 17(e) was therefore established.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern primarily involved two bad decisions on December 7 and 8, 2007. He diverted\nfrom proper to personal use of his company\u2019s van when he decided to go to the bar,\nthen he tried to drive it home while severely intoxicated resulting in an accident. His\nsubsequent alcohol assessment also revealed his alcohol dependency. He fully\ncooperated with the subsequent legal process, and successfully completed a two-year\noutpatient alcohol treatment program. He has maintained total abstinence from alcohol\n\n8\nsince the date of the incident. He is a mature individual, who has demonstrated his\nresponsibility, integrity, and trustworthiness in all other respects. He presented strong\nand uncontroverted evidence of his rehabilitation and permanent behavioral changes,\nboth to minimize the risk of recurrence and to eliminate any potential for coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  \nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial confidence concerning\nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. His post-incident\nefforts at rehabilitation have been commendable, and he met his burden to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from his alcohol consumption and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nDismissed on motion by DC\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\n1\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. On January 15,\n2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nApril 30, 2009\n\n The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nraise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n3\nGuideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 23, 2009, and I convened a hearing on April 2, 2009. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits included in the\nrecord without objection as Gx. 1 - 5. Applicant testified and submitted one exhibit\nadmitted without objection as Ax. A. Additionally, I left the record open after the hearing\n(Tr. 62) to receive additional relevant information. The record closed on April 9, 2009,\nwhen I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which has been admitted without\nobjection as Ax. B. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on April 10, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $32,360\nin delinquent debt. More specifically, it was alleged he owes approximately $14,538 in\nunpaid child support (SOR \u00b6 1.a), approximately $14,009 for payments on a home\nmortgage account more than 120 days past due (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and approximately $3,813\nfor payments on a second mortgage more than 120 days past due (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It was\nalso alleged the Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses exceeded his monthly income, according\nto an August 12, 2008, Personal Financial Statement (PFS) (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In response,\nApplicant admitted the SOR \u00b6 1.a allegation and denied the others. After reviewing the\npleadings, the transcript, and the parties\u2019 exhibits, I have made the following findings of\nrelevant fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old and works as a senior network administrator for a\ndefense contractor located in the southeastern United States. He served in the United\nStates Marine Corps from August 1990 until August 1994. From January 1995 until\nJanuary 1999, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army. He has served in the\nU.S. Army Reserve since then. Applicant has held a clearance through both his Army\nReserve and civilian positions since at least 1999. (Tr. 11)\nApplicant was activated from 2005 until June 2007. During that time, his\nemployer paid the difference between his civilian pay and his military base pay.\nApplicant also received his non-taxable basic allowance for subsistence and basic\nallowance for housing on top of that. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 50 - 51) \nApplicant has held his current job since November 2007. From January 1999\nuntil June 2007, he worked in the information technology field as a federal contractor at\njob sites on the west coast. In October 2002, he was laid off due to a lost contract. He\nfound work almost immediately, albeit at about 75% of his previous pay. For the entire\ntime he was on the west coast, Applicant also drilled in a pay status with the Army\nReserve. Applicant was unemployed in the civilian sector from June 2007, when he was\n\n3\nlaid off a second time, until he was hired in November 2007 and moved to the\nsoutheast. He did not drill or receive any Army pay from November 2007 until he found\na new unit at his current location in 2008. (Gx. 1; Tr. 60)\nApplicant and his wife have been married since April 2006. He was previously\nmarried from April 1993 until January 1999. He and his ex-wife separated in 1995.\nBefore then, his finances were sound; however, his ex-wife ran up credit card balances\nand/or failed to make payments on accounts for which Applicant was jointly liable. For\nexample, judgments were obtained against Applicant for unpaid rent. He also accrued\ntax debts, although the cause of the tax debts is unknown. Applicant paid or resolved all\nof those debts almost ten years ago. (Gx. 1; Gx. 3; Gx. 5; Gx. 6)\nApplicant re-married in April 2006. Before they were married, Applicant and his\nsecond wife had a child together in 1989. Applicant paid his now-wife $731 each month\nin child support until they got married. Applicant also fathered a child in 1997 outside his\nfirst marriage. When he learned the child was his and was ordered to pay child support,\nhis monthly obligation was back dated six months. Due in part to his lay offs in 2002 and\n2007, Applicant was at times unable to pay both his child support obligations and\naccrued a $14,000 arrearage in his support obligation for his younger child. He has paid\nthat obligation down to about $12,000 since 2007 through a garnishment of both his\ncivilian and Army Reserve pay. He could opt to have the Army garnishment ended as\nredundant, but has elected to continue it so he can pay down his debt more quickly. As\na result, he is currently paying nearly $1,000 each month on his remaining child support\nobligation, which is being enforced by the child services agency in the state where the\nchild\u2019s mother lives. (Tr. 34 - 39; Gx. 2)  \nIn August 2005, Applicant purchased a home for $350,000 while living and\nworking on the west coast. At one time, the home was worth at least $450,000, but it\nlost at least $200,000 in market value through 2008. However, Applicant began to miss\npayments in 2007, when he was laid off from his previous job. He and his wife were\nunable to sell the house before he took his current job, and any rental income they\nreceived was not enough to cover the mortgage. As of November 2008, he was about\n$14,000 past due on his first mortgage and about $3,813 past due on his second\nmortgage. The second mortgage was originally for $89,000, but they have negotiated a\nsettlement of that obligation which now requires that they pay $4,000 to the lender. (Gx.\n3; Tr. 39) Applicant and his wife satisfied their first mortgage obligations through a short\nsale of the house for $180,434.91 on November 26, 2008. (Ax. B)\nWhen Applicant responded to interrogatories propounded by DOHA adjudicators\nin August 2008, he submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) that showed his\nmonthly expenses exceeded his monthly income by about $500. (Gx. 2) At his hearing,\nhe updated this information to show that his monthly income (which includes his wife\u2019s\nincome) now exceeds his expenses by nearly $2,000. (Tr. 40 - 48) Applicant and his\nwife together have five credit cards with a total balance of about $17,000. Applicant\nattributes most of their credit card balance to moving expenses and to expenses while\nhe was unemployed in 2007. Available information shows that these accounts are being\npaid as agreed. (Tr. 46 - 48; Gx. 3; Gx. 4)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n4\nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance appraisal was positive and indicates he is\nperforming at a level likely to result in future advancement. He received a merit-based\nsalary increase in September 2008. (Ax. B)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a - 1,d; that is, that Applicant accrued at least $14,000 in past due child\nsupport payments, that he owed nearly $18,000 in past due payments on his first and\nsecond mortgages as of November 2008, and that he had a negative monthly cash flow\nas of August 2008. Combined with information from a previous background\ninvestigation, it was reasonable for adjudicators to conclude that Applicant had a\nlengthy history of financial problems. Insofar as the record supports those allegations,\navailable information requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s information showed that he is repaying\nthe child support debt at a rate that is likely to resolve that obligation in the next 12\nmonths. He also presented information that shows he has resolved the delinquent\nmortgage payments alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and that he has negotiated a payment\namount for his second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.c) that is well within his ability to pay. As to\nhis current financial condition, Applicant now has a positive monthly cashflow that is\nsufficient to meet his current expenses and to ultimately resolve his remaining child\nsupport and mortgage obligations. As to the information about Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems around the time his first marriage ended, those debts and obligations appear\nto have been resolved in a timely manner. Those earlier problems were wholly\nunrelated to his current circumstances and are not likely to recur.\nAll of the foregoing supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\n\n6\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nApplicant\u2019s remaining child support debt is being paid at a steady pace and his second\nmortgage has been settled for a reasonable amount. In sum, it is unlikely that\nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts are likely to cause him to act contrary to the national\ninterest to generate funds. On balance, available information is sufficient to mitigate the\nalleged security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Available information portrays\nApplicant as a mature, responsible 36-year-old defense contractor employee. Aside\nfrom two periods of unemployment, he has worked steadily in the defense contracting\nindustry and in the Army Reserve. His performance in his current job bodes well for\ncontinued advancement and he has taken the steps he could reasonably take to resolve\nhis mortgage problems, which were not of his doing. Also to be considered here is his\nservice in the military, with the Marine Corps and the Army, for nearly 20 years. A fair\nand commonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security concerns raised by\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are mitigated, and his finances do not put him at risk of\nacting contrary to the national interest. Any doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. Request for security\nclearance is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. 3 Applicant married his current wife in 2007 and has six children by various women (Tr. 109-14). Two of the children were born to Applicant and his wife before their marriage (Tr. 126). Three of his children currently live with him and his wife (Tr. 109- 10). The remaining three children live with their mothers. Applicant began selling drugs in early 1991 at the age of 21 to support his mother who had been evicted from their apartment and had no place to live (see ex. 10). In April 1991, he sold cocaine to an undercover police officer near an elementary school and was arrested (see ex. 10; Tr. 48). When he appeared in court in April 1991 to answer cocaine distribution and possession charges, he pleaded guilty to four counts of cocaine possession with the intent to distribute and was sentenced to 16 years of imprisonment (6 years suspended) and fined $100 (see exs. 5, 9, and 10). Applicant completed two years of his prison sentence before he was released in July 1993 (see ex. 10; Tr. 48-49). Following his 1993 prison release, Applicant served two years (1993-1995) of parole.

The case was scheduled for hearing\non June 29, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of 10 exhibits (ex.); Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself)\nand four exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received August 6, 2009.  Based upon a\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n \n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the appearance, Applicant asked for additional time to\nsupplement the record with documented child support payments.  For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with copies of his most recent child\nsupport payments to the state\u2019s department of social services on behalf of his three\ndaughters.  The submissions are accepted as Applicant\u2019s exhibit E.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant: (a) was charged in April 1991\nwith four counts of cocaine distribution near school property and four counts of\npossession of controlled drugs with intent  (both felonies), convicted of drug possession\nwith intent (with the remaining charges nolle prossed), sentenced to 16 years of\nimprisonment (six years suspended) and fined $100; (b) was charged in December\n1998 with possession of cocaine (a felony) and driving on a suspended operator\u2019s\nlicense (a misdemeanor), with the charges nolle prossed; (c) was charged in August\n2000 with trespassing (dismissed); and (d) falsified his January 2007 security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (a felony) (incorporated under\nGuideline E).\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his January 2007 e-QIP\nby omitting his 1998-2000 criminal charges and his debts over 180 days and 90 days\ndelinquent, respectively.\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant accrued (a) eight delinquent  debts\nexceeding $3,000, (b) back child support of $10,176, and (c) an unsatisfied adverse\njudgment that was entered in April 2004 for child support arrearage of $385. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations.  He\nadmitted each of the criminal charges and disposition, while denying any intent to falsify\nhis security clearance application. He admitted all but one of his alleged debts: his\ncreditor 3.g debts, which he could not identify.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40-year-old maintenance trade helper of a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\n\n \n3\nApplicant married his current wife in 2007 and has six children by various women\n(Tr. 109-14).  Two of the children were born to Applicant and his wife before their\nmarriage (Tr. 126).  Three of his children currently live with him and his wife (Tr. 109-\n10). The remaining three children live with their mothers.\nApplicant began selling drugs in early 1991 at the age of 21 to support his mother\nwho had been evicted from their apartment and had no place to live (see ex. 10).  In\nApril 1991, he sold cocaine to an undercover police officer near an elementary school\nand was arrested (see ex. 10; Tr. 48).  When he appeared in court in April 1991 to\nanswer cocaine distribution and possession charges, he pleaded guilty to four counts of\ncocaine possession with the intent to distribute and was sentenced to 16 years of\nimprisonment (6 years suspended) and fined $100 (see exs. 5, 9, and 10).  Applicant\ncompleted two years of his prison sentence before he was released in July 1993 (see\nex. 10; Tr. 48-49).  \nFollowing his 1993 prison release, Applicant served two years (1993-1995) of\nparole. From 1995 through 2003 (about eight years), he was on unsupervised probation\n(see exs. 5 and 10; Tr. 49-50).  He has since paid all but $385 of his  court-imposed fine\n(which has since accrued considerable interest) stemming from his 1991 conviction, and\nhe has satisfied all of the court\u2019s sentencing and probation conditions (see exs. 10, A\nand B; Tr. 52-53). \nIn December 1998, Applicant was arrested for possession of cocaine (a felony)\nand driving on a suspended license (a misdemeanor) (see ex. 3).  He was stopped and\nsearched by police before he was arrested and transported to the local police station.\nUpon his arrival at the police station, he was booked and escorted to court for\narraignment before a local magistrate (Tr. 44-45).  Applicant assures he was not aware\nof his license suspension until after his arrest (Tr. 55-57).  Records report that the\ncharges were nolle prossed.  Applicant\u2019s claims and denials are not challenged in the\nrecord and are accepted.  \nOn August 5, 2000, Applicant was charged with trespassing by local police (see\nex. 4).  The arresting police, according to Applicant, thought he was trying to accost a\nwoman and charged him with trespass (Tr. 45).  Applicant assured that the woman was\nhis mother who he was trying to help (Tr. 59-60).  The charges were dismissed, and\nApplicant\u2019s account is accepted (see ex. 3).  \nAppellant\u2019s SF-86 omissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in January 2007 (see ex. 2), Applicant omitted his\n1991 drug distribution charges and conviction as well as his 1998 and 2000 charges.\nHe attributes his omissions to confusion and misunderstanding of the questions (Tr.63-\n66).  He claimed to believe the question asked for charges and convictions within the\nlast seven years and excluded arrests that did not result in convictions (Tr.67-77). Even\nwith the discounting of Applicant\u2019s comprehension skills. his explanations are not\nconvincing under all of the circumstances associated with his omissions.  Questions\n\n \n4\n23(a) and (b) clearly place no time limitations on covered arrests, charges, and\nconvictions.  Aware of all of his arrests, charges and convictions, he took more than two\ndays to consider the questions before answering \u201cno\u201d to the questions pertaining to his\nprior arrests.  Were he uncertain about any terms in the questions, he could have\ncommented in the in section 30 of the question. He provided no additional comments,\nhowever, in the space provided for in section 30.\nApplicant also failed to disclose his child support arrearage and other debts when\nhe was asked in question 28 whether he had any debts over 180 days delinquent or\ncurrently over 90 days delinquent. Applicant attributes these debt omissions to his\nmistaken understanding of the question (claiming he did not believe the question\ncovered child support arrearage) (Tr. 81-87). \nApplicant\u2019s claimed misunderstandings are neither plausible nor credible.\nSection 28 is quite clear in the language it employs to inquire about an individual\u2019s\ndelinquent debts.  The subpart questions are straight-forward and make no attempt to\nclassify particular kinds of debts. Applicant was quite aware of his child support\narrearage, some of which originated before he was incarcerated (Tr. 84-85).  Applicant\u2019s\nomissions reveal a disposition to omit as much relevant material about his finances as\nhe could possibly claim without drawing attention to himself. His answers lack credibility,\nthough, and cannot avert credible findings that his debt omissions were either deliberate\nor made with reckless disregard for the truth.  Applicant\u2019s explanations, considered as a\nwhole, reflect a conscious decision on his part to omit his adverse criminal charges and\nconviction. \nIn April 2007, an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ncontacted Applicant to interview him regarding his 1991 felony cocaine distribution\ncharges (see ex. 10).  From the tenor of the introduction, it is clear that the investigator\nknew about the 1991 charges in advance of the interview and wanted to question\nApplicant about the charges.  The summary produced a detailed account of Applicant\u2019s\npast drug use and involvement in the 1991 incident, and provides ample indicia of  the\ninvestigator\u2019s confronting Applicant with the 1991 charges before inquiring about\nadditional details (ex. 10).  Applicant was apparently never asked about any other\narrests or delinquent debts, and disclosed no information about any of them (inclusive of\nchild support arrearage).  The OPM summary of interview itself contains no mention of\nApplicant\u2019s other arrests/charges, or anything about his debts and finances. Without any\nmanifest disclosure of his other arrests/charges and the details of his aged child support\narrearage and other delinquent debts, he cannot be credited with any good-faith\ncorrections.\nRecords reveal that Applicant was laid off for a  two-month period in 2008 (i.e.,\nJanuary to March 2008).  When he was recalled to work in March 2008 (Tr. 51-52), he\nwas asked to complete another e-QIP (ex. 1).  When answering question 23(a), this\ntime he listed his 1991 conviction.  Once again, though, he did not list his 1998 and\n2000 arrests, or any of his delinquent debts in the space provided by question 28.  Nor\n\n \n5\ndid he mention any of his arrests/charges or debts (inclusive of his child support\narrearage) in the remarks section of question 30. \nWhile Applicant is to be commended for providing details of his 1991 conviction\nwhen asked about it by the OPM investigator in April 2007, he cannot be credited with\nproviding prompt, good-faith corrections of his earlier omissions.  His corrections were\nneither prompt nor complete.  When asked why he did not add his 1998 and 2000\ncharges to the 1991 charges he disclosed in his 2008 e-QIP, he provided a new\nexplanation: no convictions emanating from either charges.  These explanations are not\ncredible either. They reflect a continued disposition by Applicant to disclose as little\nadverse information about his arrest history as he could without detection.   \nApplicant\u2019s debt accruals\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated child arrearage is quite old and has gathered\nconsiderable interest over the years. His 2008 credit reports revealed a $10,176 child\nsupport arrearage and a $385 child support judgment (see exs. 6, 7 and 8; Tr. 100-01).\nApplicant  admits to fathering three children by three different women out of wedlock, for\nwhich he became obligated to pay child support.  He identified just two children in his e-\nQIPs and provided payment information in his 2008 interrogatory responses (ex. 9) as\nfollows: a net arrearage of $748 in July 2008 on one daughter (account A) after crediting\nmonthly payments over a six-month period spanning April and July 2008 and a net\narrearage of $7,997 on another daughter (account B) after crediting monthly payments\nover a six-month period spanning March and July 2008 (see ex. 9; Tr. 100).\nApplicant provided more details of his child support payments in post-hearing\ncase information sheets (ex. E). In these case information sheets prepared by his\nstate\u2019s department of social services, he documents further payments on his account A\narrearage and a reduced balance of $158 (ex. E; Tr. 100). His updated case information\non his account B arrearage reveals further payments within the past six months and a\nreduced arrearage of $5,988 (ex. E; Tr. 100). \nAnd on an arrearage account (account C) not previously discussed, he provided\nupdated case information that shows an arrearage balance of $1,158.  Applicant\nassures he will continue to make his required monthly payments on these child support\narrearage accounts, but furnishes no details.  He provides no information either on how\nhe plans to satisfy the still outstanding  $385 child support judgment.  His child support\npayment history is a checkered one to date and provides little reason to make safe\npayment predictions.  His documented child support arrearage accounts reveal years of\nfinancial  neglect, followed by brief bursts of payments on his arrearage accounts when\nfaced with job and clearance pressures.  His payment history does not lend itself to any\nreliable track record of steady child support payments during the periods when his\nchildren and their mothers most needed his support.\nRemaining delinquent debts listed in his credit reports and covered in the SOR\ninclude his creditor 1.a debt for $830.  Applicant documents his payment of $40 on this\n\n \n6\ndebt in June 2009, leaving a balance of $760.  He provides no further documentation of\nany payments on his remaining delinquent accounts (mostly medical and credit card\naccounts) (Tr. 88-983).  His remaining accounts are six in number and exceed $1,600 in\ntotal debt (see ex. D). \nApplicant provided no repayment plan for these debts, but does show a net\nmonthly remainder of $580 on the personal financial statement he attached to his 2008\ninterrogatory responses (ex. 9).  He is current on his rent and car payments has no\ncredit cards (Tr. 102.  He assured that once he completes his child support and car\npayments, he will be able to address his remaining old debts (Tr. 98). \nEndorsements and awards\nApplicant did not provide any company performance evaluations or any\ncommendations he may have earned.  Endorsements from his supervisors who have\nworked with him for several years describe him as reliable and punctual and a solid\nprofessional who works well with others (see ex. D).  His wife of two years describes\nhim as honest (Tr. 126).\nPolicies\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs)  for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2(a)(1-9)\nof the AGs, and evaluate the individual in the context of the whole person, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG, \u00b6 30.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\n\n \n7\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is\nclearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of the Government's case. Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\n\n1        Before January 2008, certain types of conduct were subject to mandatory prohibitions against the\ngranting of security clearances under the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986).  Conduct subject to the Smith\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition included convictions resulting in sentences of more than a year.  However, this\nsection of the U.S. code, which applied only to clearances granted by DoD, was repealed on January 28,\n2008, when the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 into law.  It was\nreplaced by adding Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7435b (the Bond Amendment), which applies throughout the\nFederal government. Section 3002(c) continues the requirement of per se disqualification for certain\nconvictions and sentences. \n \n8\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious civilian employee of a defense contractor who was\ncharged and convicted of drug distribution in 1991 and served 2 years of a 16-year\nsentence (six suspended).  He was twice charged again for unrelated offenses (nol\nprossed and dismissed, respectively) and falsified his security clearance application.\nConsidered together, Applicant\u2019s actions create sufficient indicia of a pattern criminal\nconduct to raise security concerns under the criminal conduct guideline.  Applicant\u2019s e-\nQIP omissions raise security concerns separately under the personal conduct guideline. \nSecurity concerns are raised, too, over Applicant\u2019s finances based on his still outstanding\nchild support arrearage, and to a lesser extent, his unpaid consumer accounts.  \nCriminal conduct concerns\nBy itself, Applicant\u2019s 1991 felony drug distribution conviction is serious enough to\nbe security-significant, notwithstanding it is somewhat dated.  When combined with his\nensuing felony drug possession charges in 1998, his trespass charges in 2000, and the\npotential criminal implications of his e-QIP omissions in 2007 and 2008, security\nconcerns are clearly presented under Guideline J. \nApplicant\u2019s recurrent charges and related e-QIP omissions warrant initial\nconsideration of  two disqualifying conditions of the  AGs for criminal conduct: DC 31a, \u201ca\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and DC 31c, \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.\u201d While\nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrests were either not prosecuted or were dismissed, they\ncreate a pattern of criminal arrests that are linked more recently with his e-QIP omissions\nthat have potentially criminal implications.1\nWithout any evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s explanations of the underlying\nevents and circumstances surrounding his 1998 and 2000 charges, the criminal conduct\nconcerns that are based on his two ensuing offenses are not substantiated.  His more\nrecent e-QIP omissions reflect recurrent conduct that cannot be considered honest and\nforthcoming.  His omissions, as such, must be considered recurrent criminal conduct that\ncannot be totally separated from his earlier conviction by the passage of time.\n\n \n9\nApplicant may rely on MC \u00b6 32(c), \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the\noffense,\u201d of the guidelines for criminal conduct. The arrests by themselves are\ninsufficient to warrant continuing security concerns about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  And these ensuing charges are unsubstantiated. Applicant, though,\ndoes not satisfy the evidentiary requirements for taking advantage of any of the other\nmitigating conditions covered by the criminal conduct guideline.  His e-QiIP omissions\ncreate lingering doubts about his trustworthiness and preclude the characterizing his\nearlier 1991 felony conviction as an isolated incident \u201cthat it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment\u201d (see\nMC \u00b6 32(a). Applicant\u2019s recent e-QIP omissions preclude him also from applying MC \u00b6\n32(d) to his situation. MC \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement\u201d may not be applied to the facts in this record.\nBoth  from a consideration of the applicable guidelines and from a whole person\nperspective, Applicant\u2019s lacks the strength of demonstrated rehabilitation to meet all of\nthe minimum requirements under the criminal conduct guideline for continued eligibility to\nhold a security clearance. Taking  into account all of the facts and circumstances\ndeveloped in the record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of the SOR.\nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s omission of his 1991 felony conviction in his 2007 e-QIP and his multiple\nomissions of his other charges and debts over 180 days and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively, in both of his e-QIPs and his 2007 OPM interview. So much trust is\nimposed on persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for\ncandor lapses are gauged very narrowly. \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to promptly correct\nmost of his initial e-QIP omissions in the follow-up Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) interview and in his ensuing e-QIP he was asked to complete in 2008.  By willfully\nand knowingly failing to disclose all of his known charges/convictions and delinquent\ndebts in his initial 2007 e-QIP and (save for his 1991 conviction) in his follow-up OPM\ninterview and ensuing 2008 e-QIP, Applicant concealed materially important background\ninformation needed for the government to properly process and evaluate his security\nclearance \napplication. \nHis \nattributed \nreasons \nfor \nhis \nomitting \nhis\narrest/charges/conviction and delinquent debts (viz., beyond seven years and lacking\nconvictions with respect to his charges and not a defined debt regarding his debts) are\nnot sustainable grounds for averting inferences of falsification. Weighing all of the\ncircumstances surrounding his multiple e-QIP omissions and lack of any prompt, good-\nfaith corrections of all of his omissions, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the necessary probative\n\n \n10\nshowing to avert drawn conclusions that he knowingly and deliberately withheld material\nbackground information about his prior arrest/charges.\nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the AGs (inclusive of the 2(a) factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to subparagraphs 2.a through 2.e of Guideline E.\nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised here under the financial considerations guideline of\nAG \u00b6 18 of the Directive.  Under this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack\nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d AG \u00b6 18.  Applicant\u2019s outstanding child support obligations (some covered\nby a small judgment), and to a lesser extent his still delinquent consumer debts warrant\nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the AGs for financial\nconsiderations: \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in financial cases (as here) and bring\ninto play security concerns covered by the financial considerations guideline. \nExtenuating circumstances are not clearly associated with either Applicant\u2019s child\nsupport obligations covering children for which he acknowledged paternity or his\ndelinquent consumer debt.  Based on the circumstances presented here, MC \u00b6 20(b) of\nthe financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibility,\u201d has no visible applicability to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.   \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has made some additional efforts to address\nhis child support arrearage.  So far, he has not made any tangible attempts to resolve his\nother debts, despite a reported favorable net monthly remainder.  His recent efforts to\nresolve his child support arrearage (while encouraging) are not enough to establish a\nmeaningful track record for discharging all of his listed debts.  His repayment efforts to\ndate are insufficient to warrant application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \n\n \n11\nApplicant provides no evidence either of any financial counseling or personal\nbudgeting.  Without any documented counseling or budgeting in the record, MC \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d may not be applied.\nFrom a whole person standpoint, Applicant fails to provide sufficient documented\nsupport from his employer, friends, or acquaintances who are familiar with his work and\ncommunity contributions, for establishing the level of good judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness necessary to satisfy minimum requirements for holding a security\nclearance. To his credit, Applicant exhibits remorse for his indiscretions. His lifestyle\nchanges to date do reflect some improvements in managing his finances and are to be\nencouraged.  At the same time, his efforts in restoring sound managerial control over his\nfinances remain a work in progress and require additional seasoning before safe\npredictions can be made that his finances are safely stabilized and averse recurrence\nrisks.\nTaking into account all of the presented mitigation considerations in this case,\nApplicant fails to mitigate judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness concerns related to\nhis accumulation of child support arrearage and other delinquent debts. Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the financial\nconsiderations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the 2(a) factors enumerated in the AGs.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a and 1.d::\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-paras. 1.b and 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a through 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 3.a through 3.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\n\n12\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn November 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm. \n\nThe Judge found that Applicant is employed by a Defense contractor as a linguist.  He has\nbeen exposed to hostile fire while in the execution of his duties, and he enjoys an excellent\nreputation with the U.S. military.  \nHe was born and raised in Sudan.

Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR was received by the DOHA on May 28, 2009. Applicant admitted all\nSOR allegations except those contained in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.f, which he denied.\nHe requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on July 1, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 19, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nNovember 30, 2009\n\n2\nscheduled.  The government submitted 15 documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-15. GE 1 and 2 were admitted into the record without\nobjection.

In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old man who has been employed as a linguist by a defense\ncontractor since July 2006. He has worked with U.S. military forces serving in Iraq since\n2006. His duties include riding in military vehicles with military security forces outside\nsecure areas to serve as a translator. He has repeatedly been exposed to hostile fire while\nin base camps and to the constant threat of encountering improvised explosive devices\n(IEDs) while outside those camps. Applicant has earned a reputation with the U. S. military\nforces with whom he has served as an outstanding translator who is dependable and\ntrustworthy.  \nApplicant was born and raised in Sudan. His father was a camel herder until\nenvironmental conditions caused him to turn to farming. Applicant\u2019s father has been\nmarried and divorced seven times. Applicant was the only one of his father\u2019s many children\nto be provided a formal education until Applicant gave financial assistance to one of his\nhalf-brothers to attend school. That half-brother is now employed in Sudan as a teaching\nassistant at a university.  \nApplicant graduated from high school in Sudan in 1982. He then attended a trade\nschool in Sudan where he learned about weights and measures. He was employed by the\nSudanese government in the Department of Weights and Measures from 1986 until 1992.\nHe immigrated to Oman in 1992 where he obtained employment in the government office\nof the Ministry of Commerce. Applicant worked in Oman until he immigrated to the United\nStates in 1999.\nApplicant returned to Sudan from Oman in 1996 to enter into an arranged marriage.\nHe married his wife, a natural born Sudanese citizen, in Sudan on November 4, 1996.\nFollowing the marriage, Applicant returned to Oman while his wife remained in Sudan\nwhere she was employed as a teacher. She joined him in Oman in 1998. Applicant\u2019s first\nchild was born in Oman in June 1999. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife applied for a \u201clottery visa\u201d to enter the United States while she was\nstill residing in Sudan. She won that lottery in 1997, but she was not actually granted a visa\nuntil 1999. Applicant, his wife, and their child immigrated to the United States in 1999.\nUpon their entry into the United States, Applicant and his family took up residence in the\nsame state where they now reside. Applicant worked sequentially for three different\nbusinesses before he was hired as a translator in 2006. His wife worked sequentially for\nthe same three companies until 2006, when she became a stay-at-home mother for their\nfour children. Applicant\u2019s child who was born in Oman is now ten years old. His other\nchildren are seven, six, and three years old.\nApplicant and his wife became naturalized United States citizens on April 20, 2005.\nHe obtained a United States passport on June 17, 2005. He still possesses a Sudanese\npassport that expired in 2000.\nApplicant\u2019s father is 80 years old. His mother is 69 years old. They are divorced but\nboth reside in the Darfur region of Sudan. Applicant has virtually no contact with his mother\nbecause she does not have access to a telephone. He speaks with his father a couple of\ntimes a year by telephone. Applicant sends his parents money every few months, totaling\nbetween $500 and $1,000 annually.\nApplicant has a 48-year-old sister who is a citizen and resident of Sudan. Her\nhusband is a camel herder/farmer. Applicant has five half-brothers and four half-sisters\nwho are citizens and residents of Sudan. One of his half-brothers worked as a sheep\nherder in Libya for about three years, but he has now returned to Sudan. All of Applicant\u2019s\nhalf-siblings are herders/farmers and reside in the Darfur region of Sudan. With the\nexception of the half-brother for whom he provided financial educational assistance,\nApplicant has had minimal on going contact with his half-siblings since he left Sudan. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Sudan. They live several\nhundred miles outside the Darfur region. Her father is a retired farmer and her mother is\na housewife. Applicant\u2019s wife contacts her parents by telephone on occasion. In 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law visited with him and his family in the United\nStates for about three months. Applicant paid for the visit. Applicant also has seven\nbrothers-in-law and  six sisters-in-law who are citizens and residents of Sudan. Applicant\u2019s\nwife contacts one of her sisters by telephone about three times a year.   \nApplicant\u2019s wife visited with her family in Sudan in 2005. Applicant, his wife, and\ntheir children visited with their families in Sudan in 2009. Applicant\u2019s visit lasted from July\n17, 2009, until August 16, 2009. Applicant\u2019s wife and children were still visiting in Sudan\nat the time of the hearing in this case. They stayed for a portion of the visit with Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives in the Darfur region, and the rest of the visit with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s relatives in the\narea where her parents reside. Applicant\u2019s decision to visit Sudan was due to his father\u2019s\npoor health. Applicant acknowledged he will likely visit Sudan in the future.\nAccording to the United States Department of State, the Government of Sudan\nrequires all travelers to present a passport and an entry visa to enter Sudan; and only\nAmerican citizens who also possess a Sudanese national identification document (such\nas a Sudanese passport or national identification card) may apply for an entry visa at the\n\n4\nKhartoum International Airport (GE 4). Applicant did not have a visa when he arrived in\nKhartoum in July. He denies he used any sort of Sudanese identification to enter the\ncountry and instead testified he was required to have a relative meet him and his family at\nthe airport and vouch for their entry. \nApplicant applied for the grant of a small parcel of land from the Sudanese\nGovernment in about 1992. He believes that application is still pending. If he is ever\nactually awarded the land, he estimates it would be worth between $3,000 and $4,000.\nApplicant owns a house in the United States that he values at about $140,000. His equity\nin the house is about $125,000. He estimates his other net worth holdings in the United\nStates are worth about $60,000. Applicant\u2019s current salary is approximately $145,000.   \nSudan backed Iraq when it invaded Kuwait and provided sanctuary and assistance\nto Islamic terrorist groups. In the early to mid-1990s, Carlos the Jackal, Osama bin Laden,\nAbu Nidal, and other terrorist leaders resided in Sudan, and in 1997, the U. S. imposed\ncomprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against Sudan. In August 1998,\nin the wake of East Africa embassy bombings, the U. S. launched cruise missile strikes\nagainst Sudan. (GE 3) \nSudan was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the U. S. Department of\nState on August 12, 1993. (GE 10) Al-Qa\u2019ida-inspired terrorist elements, and elements of\nboth Palestine Islamic Jihad and Hamas remain in Sudan. Al-Qa\u2019ida leadership has called\nfor \u201cjihad\u201d against UN forces in Darfur. Other extremist groups have also threatened attacks\nagainst Western interests in Sudan. (GE 11)\nOn January 1, 2008, unknown assailants shot and killed two U. S. Embassy\nemployees - an American USAID officer and a Sudanese driver. (GE 4) On April 9, 2009,\nThe U.S. Department of State warned U. S. citizens of the risks of travel to Sudan and\nrecommended that American citizens defer all travel to Sudan due to uncertain security\nconditions and the possibility of violence and harassment targeting westerners (GE 5). In\nMarch 2009, the government of Sudan expelled numerous aid groups from the country and\nsenior government officials publicly called humanitarian aid workers \u201cspies\u201d. (GE 5)        \nConflict in Darfur continued despite the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement between the\ngovernment and a faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army. Civilians in Darfur\ncontinued to suffer from the effects of genocide. Government forces bombed villages, killed\ncivilians, and collaborated with militias and tribal factions to raze villages and perpetrate\nviolence against women. The government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, and there\nwere numerous serious abuses, including: extrajudicial and other unlawful killings by\ngovernment forces and other government-aligned groups; disappearances, including\nhundreds of Darfuris; torture, beatings, rape, and other cruel, inhumane treatment or\npunishment by security forces. (GE 9)  \nApplicant denies that any of his relatives living in Darfur are members of the militias\nor government forces that have been responsible for the genocide and other violence that\ncontinues in that region.

Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B (foreign influence) with\nits disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  \n6\nOnce the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.  No one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent\n8\n9\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\n10\naccess to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.11\n   \n\n The Appeal Board has stated: As a general rule, an applicant\u2019s prior history of complying with\n12\nsecurity procedures and regulations is considered to be of relatively low probative value . . . . (citations\nomitted) However, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, where\nthe applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance with security procedures\nand regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had\nmade a significant contribution to national security. (citations omitted) The presence of such circumstances\ncan give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report\nattempts at coercion or exploitation. \nW hen an \u201cApplicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S.,\n[his behavior] constitute[s] important evidence that Applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. could\nbe sufficiently strong that he [could] be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Directive\n\u00b6 E2.8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (Applicant\u2019s work as an interpreter in\nAfghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant\ncontribution to the national security.\u201d) ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr 9, 2008).\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant and his wife have numerous relatives who are citizens and residents of\nSudan. He contacts his father on occasion and he sends his mother and father financial\nassistance on a regular basis. Applicant\u2019s wife contacts her parents and one of her sisters\non a regular basis. Her parents visited here for about three months in 2007, and she visited\nwith them in Sudan in 2005, and again in 2009. Applicant visited in Sudan for a month from\nJuly to August 2009, including a visit with his family members in Darfur. Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) 7(a): contact with a foreign family member . . . or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and DC 7(d): sharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion apply.\nThere is no reason to doubt that Applicant is a completely loyal United States citizen\nor to suspect that he possesses any sense of loyalty or obligation to Sudan. The letters of\nrecommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf by U.S. military personnel who have\nworked closely with him in a combat zone attest to his efforts on behalf of U. S. military\noperations in Iraq and strongly attest to his dependability, responsibility, and loyalty to the\nUnited States.  \n12\nHowever, Applicant has many relatives who are citizens and residents of Sudan,\nincluding his parents, his sister, many half-brothers and half-sisters, and his in-laws.\n\n The potentially applicable mitigating conditions (MC) in this case are:\n13\nMC 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthe persons are located, or the positions or activities of those person in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.;\nMC 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\nMC 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\n7\nApplicant\u2019s relatives live in the extremely dangerous Darfur region of Sudan. His close\ncontinuing ties to many of his relatives have been exhibited by the financial support he\ncontinues to provide to them and the extended trip he just recently took to Sudan, including\nthe Darfur region. Applicant\u2019s wife also has obviously strong ties of affection to her parents\nas exhibited by her trips to visit them in Sudan in 2005 and 2009, and their visit with her\nin the United States in 2007. She and her children were still visiting with her family  in\nSudan at the time of the hearing of this case. \nConsidering the country and region of that country where Applicant\u2019s relatives\nreside, his recent visit to Darfur, his wife\u2019s multiple visits to Sudan, his acknowledgment\nthat he will likely visit Sudan in the future, and the obviously close ties of affection Applicant\nand his wife have to their Sudanese relatives, no mitigating condition applies.   \n13\nApplicant is entitled to substantial consideration under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nFor past three years he has placed himself in harm\u2019s way by deploying to Iraq and\nengaging in routine patrols outside secure areas with U.S. military units. He has earned\nhigh praise from and the support of many military members with whom he has served.\nHaving observed his appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying, I find his assertions\nof undivided loyalty to the United States to be credible. Applicant is additionally entitled to\ncredit for his work ethic, as evidenced by his continued gainful employment both before\nand after he immigrated to the United States.\n \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive,\nand the applicable disqualifying conditions. Having done so, I am forced to conclude that\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence security concern. He has neither\novercome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline\nB is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines E, F and J on November\n23, 2008. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 24, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 8, 2008, and requested a decision on the\nAugust 24, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\n2\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to\nEnclosure 3, E3.1.7, DoD Directive 5220.6. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on March 30, 2009, and I received the case assignment on May 15, 2009.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 4, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on June 25, 2009. The government offered 13 exhibits, GE 1 through GE 13,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf.\nHe submitted five exhibits, marked folder number 1 through folder number 5, which\nwere received and admitted into evidence without objection. I held the record open until\nJuly 9, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters. On July 6, 2009, he submitted\nExhibit 6, without objection. The record closed on July 9, 2009. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 13, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nApplicant objected to GE 4 and GE 5 on the grounds the account balance was\nincorrect. Given that the actual balance owed on these debts would be discussed in the\nhearing, I overruled his objections. He also objected to GE 10 on the grounds the\ndocument had an incorrect date. Given this document is a court record, his objection\nwas overruled. (Tr. 14-15, 17)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR,\nwith explanations. He did not admit that he intentionally falsified his security clearance\napplication.  He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility\n1\nfor a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 35 years old, seeks employment with a Department of Defense\ncontractor. A prospective employer is sponsoring his security clearance application. \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1992. He received an associate\u2019s degree\nin communications in 1995. He has not completed his bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted in\nthe United States Army Reserve in November 1997. He served some active duty during\nhis eight years in the reserves. The Army awarded him the Global War on Terrorism\nMedal and the Army Reserve Achievement Medal. The Army provided him with training,\nincluding intelligence training. He received an honorable discharge in November 2005.\nWhile an Army reservist, Applicant completed training as a police officer for a city police\ndepartment. He started working as a police officer in 2000. Applicant married in\nFebruary 2002. He resigned from the police department in 2003 to move out-of-state\nwith his wife. He and his wife separated for a short time in 2006. After they reconciled\n\nApplicant folders numbers 2 and 3; GE 1; Tr. 20-23.\n2\nApplicant folder number 1.\n3\nApplicant folder number 1; Exhibit 6; Tr. 29.\n4\n3\nand sold their home, they moved to another state, where Applicant worked. This job\nrequired him to move yet again. They finally separated more than 18 months ago. They\ndid not have any children.2\nAfter he enlisted in the Army Reserve, Applicant applied for the Army Reserve\nschool loan repayment program, which he understood would repay $20,000 of his\nschool loans. He completed the initial paperwork. In December 1999, the Army\napproved his request for repayment on five school loans totaling $21,937. On\nDecember 23, 1999, the Army paid $3,000 on the principal and $4,106 on interest for\nthese loans. On February 6, 2001, the Army paid $3,000 on the principal and $259 on\ninterest on these loans. On July 20, 2002, the Army paid $3,000 on the principal and no\nmoney for interest. Based on this information, the Army paid a total of $13,365 on\nApplicant\u2019s school loans.3\nIn 2002, Applicant served in Germany, returning to the United States in\nDecember 2002. Sometime in 2003, he realized a problem had developed with the\nrepayment of his school loans. He attempted to work through the Army processes to\nresolve this problem. At the time he completed his security application, he believed that\nthe Army was still working on this issue. Despite his belief and long efforts to resolve\nthis issue, the Army did not make any additional payments on his school loans.\nDuring his marriage, his wife managed the household finances. He did not recall\nreceiving any information from the school loan creditors that his loans were not being\npaid. He understood that he still had school debt when he met with the security\ninvestigator. He contacted the creditor and entered into a repayment plan in May 2008.\nHe started his payments in August 2008 and provided evidence he complied with his\npayment plan through March 2009. His statement that he is continuing with the payment\nplan is credible as he has shown that he pays his debts.  \n4\nApplicant and his wife drove to a bowling alley after work on March 25, 2006.\nWhile at the bowling alley, Applicant consumed four or five beers. At some point in the\nevening, he confronted his wife about the affair in which she was involved. They argued,\nleft the bowling alley with his wife driving, and drove to a 7-11 store. His wife parked the\ncar and walked away. Applicant called a cab to take him home. After he entered the\ncab, the cab driver requested the cash fare immediately. Applicant realized that his\nwallet was at home. The cab driver refused to take him home unless he initially paid the\nfare. Applicant exited the cab, entered his car, and drove for 20 or 25 minutes. About 15\nminutes from home, he pulled over to the side of the road and fell asleep with the keys\nin the car ignition. A police officer woke him up later. The police officer arrested him;\nhandcuffed him; placed him in the cruiser; drove him to the police station; photographed\n\nGE 7; Tr. 30-35.\n5\nW hen a general district court\u2019s judgment is appealed in a DUI case,  the circuit court conducts a new  or de\n6\nnovo hearing on the case. Thus, the first hearing before the circuit court is an arraignment, not a hearing on\nthe issues.

The police released him the next\nmorning. The police officer charged him with driving under the influence (DUI), a\nmisdemeanor criminal offense, and gave him the summons at the time of his arrest.5\nApplicant hired an attorney to represent him in court on his DUI charge. He\nappeared in the general district court on June 8, 2006 and pled not guilty to the DUI\ncharge. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to 30 days in jail, suspended.\nThe court also fined him $500, suspended his driver\u2019s license for 12 months, restricted\nhis driver\u2019s license, directed that he participate in an alcohol safety program, and\ndirected him not to possess alcohol for 12 months. Through his attorney, Applicant\nappealed this decision to the circuit court on June 8, 2006. The appeal notice advised\nhis attorney, and Applicant through his attorney, that his appeal was scheduled for a\nsetting of the hearing date on July 10, 2006. The court scheduled the arraignment\nhearing for August 23, 2006. Appellant  faxed a letter on August 22, 2006 to the circuit\ncourt, but not his attorney, stating that he would be unable to attend the hearing on the\nnext day, August 23, 2006, and that he was withdrawing his appeal. The circuit court\ncontinued the hearing, which is characterized as an arraignment,  until October 2, 2006\n6\nand did not act on his request to withdraw his appeal. Applicant did not appear in court\nfor his arraignment on October 2, 2006, although his attorney did. When Applicant did\nnot show for the arraignment, he violated a previous court order to appear on this date.\nThe court issued a failure to appear warrant (also titled Capias) for contempt of court on\nthis date. The record evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, does not explain the\nreason that he did not know about the October trial date or that the warrant had been\nissued. Applicant believed that the case had been dropped. He learned about the\nwarrant during the interview with the security clearance investigator. Between August\n2006 and 2008, he sporadically contacted his attorney because he was moving and\nworking in different areas of the country.7\nIn a letter dated May 6, 2008, Applicant\u2019s attorney advised that he and Applicant\nwere working on the above circuit court case and that a court date had not yet been set.\nThe letter does not discuss the Capias or indicate the extent of Applicant\u2019s knowledge of\nthe Capias. The circuit court rescheduled the hearing for the Capias and the DUI on\nMarch 18, 2009. Applicant appeared in circuit court with his attorney on this date.\nApplicant again advised the circuit court that he wanted to withdraw his appeal and\naccept the judgment of the general district court. Applicant and his attorney completed\nthe appropriate paperwork and the circuit court affirmed the judgment. The circuit court\nsentenced Applicant to 30 days in jail, suspended, and fined him $500, suspending\n$250. The circuit court directed Applicant to pay his fine and court costs that day; to\nkeep the peace, be of good behavior and violate none of the state\u2019s penal laws for 12\n\nApplicant folder number 5; GE 13.\n8\nApplicant folder number 5; Tr. 59.\n9\nApplicant folder number 2; Tr. 69-74.\n10\n5\nmonths; not to possess or consume alcohol for 12 months; and to enter into an alcohol\nsafety program. It also suspended his driving privileges in the state for 12 months. On\nmotion of the prosecutor, the court nolle prossed the failure to appear charge (Capias).\nThe court actually signed the order from the March hearing on June 4, 2009.8\nApplicant does not drink alcohol, and has not since 2006, because \u201cthe DUI\npretty much destroyed my life.\u201d Applicant applied to a medical school intensive\noutpatient alcohol and drug abuse program. The program assessed him on May 4, 2009\nand recommended that he attend classes two nights a week for three weeks. Applicant\nenrolled in the program and attended the recommended classes, which included\nindividual and group counseling sessions. The program discharged him on May 28,\n2009, noting that he did not exhibit any signs of alcohol or chemical dependency, that\nhe understood the seriousness of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of\nalcohol, and that he accepted responsibility for his wrongdoing. This program meets the\nrequirements of the state court order.9\nApplicant does not currently work. His employer laid him off in December 2007.\nHe received unemployment from January 2008 until February 2009. Presently, he lives\nwith his parents and occasionally performs odd jobs. He actively applies for a variety of\njobs, but has not yet received a firm job offer. He has been offered at least one job\nconditioned upon obtaining a security clearance. Applicant uses his savings to pay his\nbills when he lacks sufficient income. His monthly expenses are limited to his school\nloan, gas for his car, car insurance, and rental for two storage units at an estimated\nmonthly expense of $500.   \n10\nWhen Applicant completed his SF-86 on August 18, 2006, he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nthe following questions:\nSection 23: Your Police Record \nd. \nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies\na.\nIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\nb.\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n\nGE 12, at p. 2; Tr. 46-47, 52.\n11\nTr. 62-67.\n12\nApplicant folder number 3.\n13\n6\nWhen Applicant met with the security investigator on March 6, 2007, he\nacknowledged he had been arrested and charged with a DUI in March 2006 after being\nconfronted with this information. During the interview, Applicant stated that he thought\nthe case had been dropped and that he did not volunteer the information about his DUI\narrest because he was scared and did not know how it would affect his security\nclearance. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he answered \u201cno\u201d because he did not\nhave a final \u201cdeliberation\u201d on the charge. He also agreed that he probably thought his\nDUI would hurt his clearance.   \n11\nThe security investigator did not discuss Applicant\u2019s finances in the interview.\nApplicant did not list his school loan debt as past due because he had requested the\nArmy to pay the debt under its repayment loan program. He knew in 2003 that there\nwas a problem with his loan repayment papers and had requested assistance from the\nArmy. In 2006, he thought the loan was being paid. He did not recall receiving any\nnotices from creditors about this debt. His wife handled the finances and may have\nreceived a notice, but he did not recall any information on this matter. He never looked\nat his credit report.12\nApplicant provided documents reflecting his performance in the past. He received\na commendation from the police department for his work. He also completed many\ntraining courses in the Army Reserve and on his own. He received favorable\nperformance evaluations in the past.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n7\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n\n8\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with DUI, a misdemeanor offense, in\n2006. When he failed to appear in court in October 2006, the court issued a warrant\nbased on contempt of a court order. Because of communication problems, this matter\ndid not fully resolve until March 2009. As a result of Applicant\u2019s withdrawal of his appeal,\nhe accepted the original trial court finding in March 2009 and the court imposed\nsentence as of that date. He is currently on probation for this offense. In light of my\nfindings under Guideline E, the allegation that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is\nestablished. The government has established the above disqualifying conditions.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the following conditions may establish that the Applicant has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s initial DUI conviction occurred more than three years ago, even\nthough he is currently on probation for that conviction. Since his 2006 arrest, Applicant\nhas not consumed alcohol. He attended the court required alcohol abuse program,\nwhich did not find any signs of alcohol abuse or chemical dependency, and he accepted\nresponsibility for his alcohol conduct. The court nolle prossed the related failure to\nappear warrant. The 2006 arrest is Applicant\u2019s only arrest for criminal conduct.\nApplicant has partially mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline J\nas there is evidence of successful rehabilitation of his alcohol use.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n9\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt related to his education\nloans. He did not pay these loans for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under AG \u00b6\n20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Mitigation may also be shown\nunder AG & 20(c) where there is evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.@ Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows\nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d\nApplicant incurred education debt while a college student. After he enlisted in the\nArmy Reserve, he applied for the school loan repayment program. The Army accepted\nhis application and paid over $13,000 of his school loan debt, including interest. The\npayments stopped when problems arose during the Army payment processing in 2003.\nApplicant sought help through the Army with resolving the payment problem. When he\nlearned that his education loans were delinquent, he developed a repayment plan. He\nhas complied with the terms of his repayment plan. This is his only debt and he is\npaying it. He has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his education\ndebt. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n14\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer must be deliberate. The government established that Applicant omitted a\nmaterial fact from his SF-86 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 23d about his 2006\nDUI arrest, 28a, about debts over 180 days delinquent, and 28b about debts currently\n90 days over due. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. In his response, he\ndenies, however, that he had an intent to hide this information from the government.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred.14\nWhen he completed his SF-86 and e-QIP in August 2006, Applicant did not list\nhis March 2006 DUI arrest because he feared it would negatively impact the approval of\nhis application for a security clearance. Even though he appealed his conviction, he\nclearly knew he had been arrested and convicted of a DUI in June 2006. His\nacknowledgment that he was scared about the impact of this arrest is an admission that\nhe intentionally falsified this answer. The government has established its case as to\nallegation 3.a. under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e). Concerning his answers regarding his\nfinances, Applicant believed in 2006 that his educational loans were still being\nconsidered by the Army. Since his wife managed the household finances and did not\nadvise him of a problem with his education loans, he did not intentionally falsify his\n\n11\nanswers to Questions 28a and 28b because his belief was mistaken. The government\nhas not established intentional falsification under allegations 3.b and 3.c.\nAllegation 3.d is a factual statement, which supports allegation 3.a, not an\nindication of specific personal conduct covered under this guideline. Thus, this\nallegation is found in favor of Applicant. The government established the existence of\nthe failure to appear warrant at the time of the issuance of the SOR. \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, an applicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns in\nthe following manner in this case:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nAfter reviewing the facts of this case and the above mitigating conditions, I\nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the falsification of his answer to question 23d\nin his security clearance application. However, when he appeared in court on March 18,\n2009, the prosecutor dismissed the Capias warrant. Thus, this warrant is not active and\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about this warrant.\nGuideline E is found against Applicant.\n\n12\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nsuccessfully worked as a police officer, in the Army Reserve, and in industry. He\nmanages his limited finances and does not live beyond his financial means. During a\ncrisis in his marriage, he drank too much one evening, which resulted in a fight with his\nwife. After the fight, he drove his car while intoxicated. The police arrested and charged\nhim with DUI. The court convicted him of this charge and he is currently on probation.\nHe lied on his e-QIP about his DUI because he feared that it would impact his eligibility\nfor a security clearance. His failure to be truthful is more serious than his DUI. His lack\nof honesty raises questions about his trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations, but has not mitigated the personal conduct and criminal conduct\nconcerns. \n\n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

She also provided additional information to support her request for a security \nclearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior information technology consultant who has \nworked for a defense contractor since May 2000, and is seeking to maintain a security \nclearance. Her second line supervisor has daily contact with Applicant and has been \nimpressed by Applicant\u2019s exemplary work and her integrity. She produces quality work \nwithout missing a deadline (AE E). Her dedication to her job and her loyalty over the \nyears is without question. She delayed a trip to China on one occasion so that she could \ncomplete a work project. She is the best person that he has ever worked with in support \nof the client (Tr. 74). Applicant is a kind, intelligent person who is always willing to put \nforth extra efforts to ensure tasks are completed on time, as well as, help others with \ntasks when needed. Applicant is a team player. She greatly contributes to the success \nof the company by sharing technical knowledge (AE B). She is highly respected by her \npeers. Applicant is described as a reliable, skilled and honest person. Her supervisor is \nconfident that she is qualified to maintain a secret level security clearance. He also \nbelieves that her loyalty is to the U.S. (Tr. 78). \n \nApplicant was born and raised in the PRC and came to the U.S. in 1988. She \nattended a Chinese university and received a degree in electronics. After obtaining her \ndegree, she worked for a university in China from April 1984 until December 1988 (Tr. \n \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n49). In June 1988, she married her husband in China. She entered the U.S. on a visa \n(spouse) in 1988. She and her husband have a daughter who was born in May 1991. \nFrom 1995 to 1998, she studied at an American University obtaining a degree in \ncomputer science (GE 1). In June 2001, Applicant became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 53).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was born in the PRC. In 1986, he came to the U.S. on a \nstudent visa to study mathematics (Tr. 50). He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. \nin 2000. Her husband works for a large American company (GE 2). Applicant and her \nhusband live together with their daughter in their U.S. home. Her husband\u2019s parents are \ndeceased (Tr. 54). Applicant\u2019s husband visited his family in China when his parents \nwere alive (Tr. 68). He has also gone to the PRC for an educational conference as part \nof his work (Tr. 69). \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in China and live in the PRC. Her father, age 76, is \na retired member of a Chinese Opera company and her mother, age 71, is also retired \nfrom the Chinese Opera (Tr. 56). Her father is ill and has been hospitalized several \ntimes over the past year. Applicant usually maintains contact with her parents by \ntelephone twice a month but it could be more frequent if her father is not well. Her \nparents currently live in a small apartment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of the PRC. He is 39 years old. He \nworks for a film company. Applicant does not know the name of the company. She \ncontacts her brother by telephone approximately five to six times a year.  She does visit \nwith him when she is in China visiting her parents. She also corresponds by email with \nhim on occasion (Tr. 58). \n \nSince coming to the U.S. Applicant traveled to the PRC to visit her parents in \nApril 1994, June 2004, March 2007, and March 2009. She always reports her trips to \nher employer (AE A). Applicant\u2019s visits are usually two or three weeks in length. She \nstays with her parents in their apartment. When she visits with them she has sometimes \nvisited with former colleagues from the university (Tr. 60).   \n \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant purchased a condominium for her parents but she did \nnot travel to PRC to do so. She sent her mother the money ($60,000) and her mother \nrepresented her. Applicant is the listed owner of the condominium. She pays all \nexpenses. She does not have a Chinese bank account. She sends money through her \nU.S. account to her mother who handles the bills.  Her parents have not moved into the \ncondominium due to her father\u2019s need to be closer to the hospital. The condominium is \ncurrently empty (Tr. 62). Applicant\u2019s mother hopes to move into the condominium at \nsome time in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant and her husband own a home in the U.S. The current real estate value \nof the property is $659,520. She and her husband have a retirement portfolio. As of May \n2009, the value was approximately $320,000 (AE C). They also have $140,000 in \nsavings. They have approximately $430,000 in equity in their house in the U.S., which is \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \ntheir residence. They own no property outside the U.S. except for the condominium \npurchased for her parents (Tr.71)  \n \nChina \n \nThe Peoples Republic of China (the PRC) is a repressive, totalitarian government \nwith foreign policy goals antithetical to the U.S. However, the PRC has cooperated with \nthe U.S. in the global war on terrorism in recent years. Its authoritarian government is \ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party.2 The PRC possesses large and \nincreasingly sophisticated military forces, which include strategic nuclear weapons and \nmissiles. 3 In foreign relations, the PRC and the U.S. have been rivals since the Cold \nWar, with particular disagreement on the status of Taiwan. The PRC continues to resist \nwhat it considers U.S. superpower dominance, despite improving economic relations.4 \n \n The PRC has an active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. \nintelligence and economic information, and operates against its citizens in the U.S.5 The \nPRC obtains access to restricted technology through industrial espionage and the PRC \noperates an aggressive clandestine effort to acquire additional technologies. This is \nsuch a problem that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have rated \nthe PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of \nU.S. technology.6 \n \nThe PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political \ndissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, \ntorture, and mistreatment of prisoners.7 PRC authorities monitor telephone \nconversations, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communication, open and censor \nmail, monitor and enter residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, \nand fax machines. All hotels have a sizable internal security presence and hotel \nguestrooms are sometimes bugged and searched for sensitive or proprietary material.8 \n \n \n2 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: China, dated January 2009 (Background Note on \nChina), at 1-2. \n \n3 Id., p. 13-14. \n  \n44 Id., p. 14 -17. \n   \n5 Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use \nOnly] (Intelligence Threat Handbook), dated June 2004, at 17.  \n \n6 U.S \u2013 China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S \u2013 \nChina Economic and Security Review Commission, dated November 2007, at 104.  \n  \n7 Background Note on China, at 7-8.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n \n \n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual=s access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their \ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress \nexists; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation;  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n7\n                                                          \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nations from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; [and] \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the PRC. Her brother is a citizen \nand resident of the PRC. Applicant maintains contact with her parents by telephone \nusually twice a month. Although, she acknowledged that it could be more frequent if her \nfather is ill. She also maintains contact with her brother by phone perhaps six times a \nyear. She sometimes corresponds with him by email. She stayed with her parents when \nshe visited the PRC in 1994, 2004, 2007, and March 2009. She also sees her brother \nwhen she visits the PRC.  \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States.  \n \nHowever, the complicated, competitive relationship of the PRC with the United \nStates places a significant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that her relationship with her relatives living in the PRC and her relatives in \nthe U.S. with close relationships to family members living in the PRC does not pose a \nsecurity risk and she is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and her family living in the PRC.9 With its mixed human rights record, and \n \n9 The Appeal Board has articulated a \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) cases because of that country\u2019s hostility to the United States and aggressive \nintelligence collection efforts. See ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (articulating \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard and reversing grant of clearance in case involving family members living in \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \npolitical, economic and military rivalry with the United States, it is conceivable that the \nPRC would target any PRC citizen or former citizen living in the United States in an \nattempt to gather valuable information from the United States. \n \nChina is a country whose human rights record is dismal and the potential for \nabuse is high. Applicant\u2019s familial relationship with citizens and residents of China \ncreates a heightened risk of potential exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure \nor coercion. There is evidence that the PRC intelligence operatives seek classified or \neconomic information from U.S. businesses and/or government agencies. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to her family members create a potential conflict of interest because these \nrelationships are sufficiently close to raise a possible security concern about her desire \nto help these relatives living in the PRC by providing classified information.  \n \nApplicant has travelled to the PRC on various occasions to visit her family. Her \nlast visit was in March 2009. She has also seen former colleagues on several \noccasions.  \n \nApplicant owns property in the PRC. In August 2006, she purchased a \ncondominium so that her parents would have a larger place to live. Although they are \nnot living in the condominium at the present time, the hope is that her mother would live \nthere in the future. The condominium purchase price was $60,000. The condominium is \nto benefit her parents. This could provide another point of pressure that PRC officials \nmight attempt to exploit. \n \n \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could raise a security concern, AG & 7(a), AG 7(b) and AG & 7(e) apply.  \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n \nthe PRC); ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. May 9, 2008). \n\n \n \n \n9\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority;  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; [and] \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \n \nAG & 8(a) and (c) do not apply to Applicant\u2019s parents and brother. She has a \nclose relationship with her family. She maintains phone contact with her parents at least \ntwice a month and email and telephone contact with her brother about six times per \nyear. She has travelled to China on four occasions since coming to the U.S. in 1988. \nHer last visit was only a few months ago in March 2009. Applicant has a husband and a \ndaughter in the U.S. but has an emotional bond with her family in China. Applicant is a \nnaturalized citizen; however, there is a heightened risk due to her family ties to China. \nUnfortunately, China is a country that causes concern in the area of potential \nexploitation and coercion which makes Applicant vulnerable. Her contact with her family \ncannot be construed as minimal. This creates a potential conflict of interest.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her parents and brother and the nature of the PRC \nGovernment and its complicated and sometimes contentious relationship to the United \nStates, all weigh against mitigating security concerns. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at \n2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with siblings in PRC \u201conce every two \nor three months\u201d not to be casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of \nabout 20 times per year not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or \nfive months not casual and infrequent). Here, Applicant\u2019s contact with her family is not \ncasual or infrequent. \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with her daughter and her strong connections to the \nUnited States partially mitigate foreign interest security concerns under 8(b). Although \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [she] \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d the \nforeign influence concern related to PRC is too great under all the facts and \ncircumstances.  Her daughter is a U.S. citizen who resides in the U.S. Her husband is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. She and her husband have lived in the U.S. since 1988. \nApplicant has worked for her government contractor with dedication and distinction. She \nhas substantial property and investments in the United States, and has had a security \n\n \n \n \n10\nclearance for a number of years. She has no desire to return to live in the PRC. She is a \nloyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. She has provided letters and witness statements to \ncorroborate her loyalty and trustworthiness. \n \nApplicant has a condominium in the PRC valued at $60,000. She intends for this \ncondominium to be used by her parents. While Applicant has substantial property and \ninvestments in the U.S., the condominium could be used to pressure or manipulate her \nparents. AG 8(f) does not fully apply in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to the PRC and the heavy \nburden an Applicant carries when she has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning the PRC must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in the PRC. The PRC has a mixed to poor human rights record. \nThe PRC is one of the most aggressive nations in the collection of U.S. intelligence and \nsensitive economic information.  \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1988. She became a U.S. citizen in \n2001. Her husband and her daughter live with her in the U.S. She has worked for a \ndefense contractor for a number of years. She is described as reliable and honest. She \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                          \nperforms her job in an exemplary manner. She has held a security clearance with no \nadverse results for a number of years. She has substantial property and connections to \nthe U.S. She was candid and credible in describing a loyalty to the U.S. Her employer \nhighly recommends the maintaining of her security clearance. She is a kind and caring \ndaughter and sister.   \n \nUnfortunately, the totality of the circumstances in this case does not weigh in \nfavor of Applicant. Given Applicant\u2019s family ties to her parents and her brother in the \nPRC, the frequency of her contact, her visits to the PRC and her property in the country, \nI cannot find that there is not a heightened risk with respect to the PRC. Applicant \npresents a difficult position given the fact that her family is in the PRC. \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of her connections to PRC, and to the \nUnited States, I conclude Applicant has not carried her burden of fully mitigating the \nforeign influence security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d10 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is not eligible for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because her \nparents and brother live in the PRC. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n10See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n \n12\n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________ \nNOREEN A. LYNCH \nAdministrative Judge \n",

SOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged that Applicant was terminated and deemed not eligible for rehire by an employer in April 2007 after the employer\u2019s investigations revealed that Applicant had engaged in intimidation of others, inappropriate language, possession of property for personal gain, and improper instruction of subordinates in time reporting. Applicant admitted that the investigation occurred, but he denied the allegation. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) SOR \u00b6 1.b. alleged that Applicant had received a written warning from his employer in June 2006 for inappropriate language discussion and intimidation of others. He was advised at that time that further violations would result in additional corrective action, including possible termination. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the facts in allegation in \u00b6 1.b. (SOR; Answer to SOR.)

His eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on July \n23, 2007.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 29, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 1, \nSeptember 20, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. Applicant\u2019s hearing was scheduled for January 11, 20I0. However, Applicant \nrequested a continuance because he was suffering from a serious verified medical \ncondition. The Government did not object to Applicant\u2019s request. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a continuance on April 19, 2010. The order granting the continuance and \nApplicant\u2019s supporting documents are identified as Hearing Exhibit (H.E.) 1. \n \nApplicant\u2019s medical condition improved, and, on June 7, 2010, I convened a \nhearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no witnesses and \nintroduced three exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 3 and admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced \nnine exhibits, which were identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through Ex. I. All of \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I \nleft the record open for four calendar days, until close of business on June 11, 2010, so \nthat Applicant could, if he wished, supply a missing page from his Ex. I. On June 11, \n2010, Applicant reported by e-mail to Department Counsel that he was unable to locate \nthe missing page. Applicant\u2019s e-mail is identified as H.E. 2. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on June 14, 2010. \n \n                                                    Findings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations under AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.d.). SOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged that Applicant was terminated and deemed not eligible \nfor rehire by an employer in April 2007 after the employer\u2019s investigations revealed that \nApplicant had engaged in intimidation of others, inappropriate language, possession of \nproperty for personal gain, and improper instruction of subordinates in time reporting. \nApplicant admitted that the investigation occurred, but he denied the allegation. (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. alleged that Applicant had received a written warning from his \nemployer in June 2006 for inappropriate language discussion and intimidation of others. \nHe was advised at that time that further violations would result in additional corrective \naction, including possible termination. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nfacts in allegation in \u00b6 1.b. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on the SF-86 he \nexecuted and signed on July 23, 2007, and attempted to conceal the information \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. when he responded \u201cNo\u201d to Question 20 which asked whether he \nhad ever been fired from a job; quit a job after being told he would be fired; left a job by \nmutual agreement following allegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual agreement \nfollowing allegations of unsatisfactory performance; or left a job for other reasons under \nunfavorable circumstances. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n(SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. alleged that Applicant falsified material facts when, in an October \n2007 interview with an authorized investigator, he reported that he had resigned from \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis job in April 2007, thereby concealing the information set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.d.  (SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nApplicant, who is 55 years old, has been married and divorced twice. He is the \nfather of three adult children. He dropped out of high school before graduation but later \nearned a General Education Development (GED) credential. In 1975, Applicant enlisted \nin the military and served for two years. He has taken some college classes, and he \nreceived technical training while in military service. He was granted a security clearance \nin 1975. Since 1981, he has been employed as a senior engineer and manager, and he \nwas granted eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in 2003.  \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 44-46, 76.) \n \n \nFrom October 2001 until April 2007, Applicant was employed first as an engineer \nand later as manager of product operations by a federal contractor, identified as \nEmployer A. As a manager, he was paid $84,000 a year and was responsible for \nsupervising seven employees. He had experience as a manager in three previous jobs, \nand Employer A also provided him with management training in January 2007. (Ex. 1 at \n3-4; Ex. 2 at 2-4; Ex. H; Tr. 44-46, 74-77.) \n \n \n \nEmployer A provided Applicant\u2019s employment records in response to DOHA\u2019s \nrequest. Employer A\u2019s business records established that in April 2006, employees under \nApplicant\u2019s management and supervision alleged he had intimidated others in the \nworkplace and had used inappropriate language in workplace discussions. The \nemployer investigated the allegations and found them to be factually accurate. On June \n27, 2006, the employer issued Applicant an employee corrective action memo, which he \nsigned, acknowledging receipt. The employee corrective action memo read, in pertinent \npart: \n \nOn 5/11/06 employees that work in the integration and test department . . . \nwere interviewed to fact find and obtain information about the work \nenvironment and your management style. Based on the interviews the \nfollowing violations were corroborated 1) inappropriate language \ndiscussion and 2) intimidation of others. The company deems your \nbehavior to be unacceptable, and in violation of the expectations set forth \nin [Company\u2019s name] expected behaviors.  \n \n(Ex. 2 at 32.) \n \n \nThe employee corrective action memo further stated: \n \nYou are expected to interact with others in a professional manner, treat all \nemployees with respect and dignity, and exhibit a professional \nmanagement demeanor. Further, you are expected to adhere to all of the \ncompany\u2019s expectations as outlined in [citation deleted], Expected \nBehaviors. It\u2019s been acknowledged that your behavior has improved over \nthe past several weeks with coaching and training. Further violations will \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresult in a review for additional corrective action, up to and including \npossible discharge from [Company A].  \n \n(Ex. 2 at 32.) \n \n \nAdditionally, Company A\u2019s business records reflect that in November 2006,  \nCompany A\u2019s management learned that Applicant instructed three of the employees he \nsupervised to charge two hours of time to a program the employees were not working \non. Company A\u2019s business records also reflect that Applicant directed employees he \nsupervised to load three hard plastic cases belonging to a government customer into his \nvehicle. He then told the employees he was taking the cases to his home. He took the \ncases to his home, used them for his own purposes, and did not return them. (Ex. 2 at \n9, 23; Ex. 3 at 4.) \n \n \nIn January 2007, Company A\u2019s management learned that Applicant confronted \nan employee he supervised and accused him of failing to complete a work task. The \nemployee responded that he had completed the task, and he showed Applicant proof of \ncompletion. Applicant then began to yell at the employee, threatened him with the loss \nof his job, made other threats, and sent the employee home. When Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor learned of the incident, he sent Applicant home. Several employees reported \nthat they feared Applicant\u2019s angry flare-ups, intimidating behavior, and retaliation \nthreats. (Ex. 2 at 22-23.) \n \n \nEmployer A convened a threat management team to review Applicant\u2019s \nworkplace conduct. The threat management team concluded that Applicant\u2019s behavior \nwas of medium to medium-high risk status. By memorandum dated January 24, 2007, \nCompany A gave Applicant notice that he was being placed on paid administrative \nleave, pending investigation of allegations of unacceptable workplace behavior, and \ndirected him to contact the company\u2019s employee assistance program. He was told he \ncould contact his direct supervisor, two human resource generalists, and the individual \nconducting the investigation of his behavior. He was not allowed to communicate with \nany other employees. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the notice of administrative \nleave. (Ex. 2 at 22-24; Ex. E;. Tr. 58-59.) \n \n \nApplicant contacted the employee assistance program, and, as a part of the \ninvestigation, he was interviewed by a psychologist three times in January and February \n2007. On April 6, 2007, Applicant, who remained on paid administrative leave, sent an \ne-mail to his immediate supervisor and one of the human resource generalists. The e-\nmail read, in pertinent part: \u201cI[n] light of the current situation I have resigned my position \nwith [Company A] effective today.\u201d At his hearing, Applicant defined \u201cthe current \nsituation\u201d as his inability to obtain from his employer information on the progress of the \ninvestigation. (Ex. A; Ex. 3 at 4; Tr. 49, 60-61.) \n \n \nOn April 16, 2007, Company A sent Applicant a letter by certified mail. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the letter and offered it as his Ex. C at his hearing. The letter \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nstated that his voluntary resignation had been converted to a discharge. The letter \nfurther stated:  \n \nSince your resignation was submitted prior to closing stages of several \nCorporate Investigations the company is unable to accept your voluntary \nresignation. Based on the investigative findings, and review of the finding \nby the Employee Corrective Action Review Board (ECARB), your actions \nwere deemed unacceptable and in violation of the Expected Behaviors for \nall [Company A] employees. The decision of the ECARB was to terminate \nyour employment from [Company A] without eligibility for rehire. Enclosed \nis a copy of the Corrective Action Memo (CAM).1 \n  \n(Ex. C; Tr. 55.) \n \n \nAfter receiving notice of termination from Company A, Applicant applied for \nunemployment benefits. Company A disputed Applicant\u2019s claim for unemployment \nbenefits and reported that he had been fired for cause. Applicant was required to repay \nthe money he had received in unemployment compensation. (Tr. 87-90.) \n \n \nOn July 23, 2007, Applicant signed and certified his SF-86. Question 20 on the \nSF-86 seeks information about an individual\u2019s employment record. Specifically, \nQuestion 20 asks if, in the past seven years, an applicant has been fired from a job; quit \nafter being told he or she would be fired; left a job by mutual agreement following \nallegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of \nunsatisfactory performance; or left a job for [an]other reason under unfavorable \ncircumstances. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 20. (Item 1 at 6-7.)  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he had received the April 16, 2007, \nletter from Employer A terminating his employment without eligibility for rehire before he \ncompleted and signed his SF-86 on July 23, 2007. When asked by Department Counsel \nwhy he then answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 20 on his SF-86, he said: \u201cI have never worked \nanywhere in my life where an accepted resignation was rejected two to three weeks \nlater and turned into a termination.\u201d (Tr. 55.) \n \n \nWhen pressed further to describe his state of mind when he answered Question \n20, Applicant stated: \u201cI\u2019m not denying that I received the letter. Again, to me, it kind of \ngoes back to what came first, the chicken or the egg.\u201d (Tr. 55.) \n \n \nThe following colloquy then occurred between Department Counsel and \nApplicant: \n \n1 The CAM, dated April 16, 2007, was signed by the human resources generalist. It concluded: \u201cBased on \nthe investigative findings the following violations were corroborated: 1) Intimidation of Others; 2) \nInappropriate Language/Discussion; 3) Possession of Property for Personal Gain; and 4) Improper \nInstruction for Time Reporting. Specifically, your actions since the issuance of a corrective action memo in \nJune 2006 are deemed unacceptable and in violation of Expected Behaviors for all [Company A] \nemployees.\u201d (Ex. D.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay, so you made a decision in your head, when \nyou read this question, since I quit before they sent me the letter, I\u2019m going to put no? \n \n \nAPPLICANT: I guess if you wanted to put it that way, it would be a fair statement. \n \n(Tr. 55.) \n \n \nOn October 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator, who asked him about his employment. He provided \nthe following facts to the investigator: he was placed on administrative leave pending an \ninvestigation of a disagreement with a subordinate; the investigation was completed in \nFebruary 2007, and he then returned to work; after he returned to work, some unknown \nperson complained that he had stolen company property; he was cursed at work a few \ntimes; he grew tired of accusations at work and in April 2007 decided to quit his job. His \ndaughter is aware that he quit his job, and this could not be used against him in any way \nas blackmail or coercion.  Applicant said nothing to the investigator about his dismissal \nfrom Company A. (Ex. 3 at 3.) \n \n \nOn March 12, 2009, DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories, which included a copy \nof his personal subject interview, and requested the following: \u201cPlease read carefully the \ninvestigator\u2019s summary of the statement you made to the investigator during your \ninterview. On the last page of these interrogatories, you will be asked to verify the \naccuracy of the investigator\u2019s summary of the interview.\u201d (Ex. 3 at 2.) \n \n \nItem 4 on the interrogatory states: \u201cIf the report of investigation does not reflect \naccurately the information that you provided, please explain how the report is not \ncorrect.\u201d  In response to Item 4, Applicant wrote: \u201cWhile I was aware the investigation at \n[Company A] was completed in Feb. 2007, I remained on Administrative Leave until I \nresigned in April 2007.\u201d He made no other changes, revisions, or additions to the \ninvestigator\u2019s report. (Ex. 3 at 10.)  \n \n \nItem 6 on the interrogatory asks for a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d response from the applicant \nto the following: \u201cSubject to any additions or deletions made above, do you agree with \nand adopt the investigator\u2019s summary as accurately reflecting your interview? If you \nagree, these interrogatories, along with the content of the attached report of your \ninterview, may be admitted into evidence at a hearing to determine your suitability to \nhold a security clearance.\u201d Applicant checked \u201cYes\u201d in response to Item 6.  Then, on \nMarch 30, 2009, Applicant signed the following statement: \u201cI swear (or affirm) that I \nhave read the enclosed summary of my interview conducted on October 23, 2007, and I \neither found the interview to be accurate or I have added corrected entries to Item Four \n(4).\u201d (Ex. 3 at 11.)    \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he did not discuss his employment issues \nat Company A with the investigator in his personal subject interview. He denied telling \nthe investigator about being placed on administrative leave after a disagreement with a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsubordinate. He denied telling the investigator that he had been accused of stealing. He \ndenied telling the investigator that he had quit his job in April 2007. He denied that he \nintended to lie on his SF-86 or in his interview with the investigator. (Tr. 63, 71-73, 100.) \n \n                                                            Policies  \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), \n16(d)(2), and 16(e)(1). AG \u00b6 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b) reads: \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b616(d)(2) reads: \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation. This indicates but is not limited to a consideration of . . . disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior in the workplace.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) reads, in pertinent part: \n\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities \nwhich, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d   \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a. and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\u2019s former \nemployer provided business records that established his unacceptable workplace \nbehavior in 2006 and 2007. Company A\u2019s business records and Applicant\u2019s Ex. C and \nEx. D establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case in allegation 1.a. Applicant provided \nno evidence to rebut or mitigate the allegation. He denied SOR allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \nand 1.d., which alleged deliberate falsification.2 \n \nApplicant, an experienced manager and the supervisor of seven subordinate \nemployees, was put on notice by his employer in June 2006 that his unacceptable \nbehavior in the workplace had been corroborated through an investigation. He was \nwarned that similar behavior in the future could be cause for dismissal. In 2007, \nApplicant was again accused of inappropriate workplace behavior, and during the \nensuing investigation, his employer placed him on administrative leave. Before the \ninvestigation was concluded, Applicant sent an e-mail to his employer stating that he \nwas resigning from his position with the company. Applicant\u2019s employer refused to \naccept his resignation and notified him by letter dated April 17, 2007, that he was fired.  \n \nWhen he completed and certified his SF-86 three months later, in July 2007, \nApplicant concealed the fact that he had been fired or left a position under unfavorable \ncircumstances when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 20. In October 2007, when he was \ninterviewed by an authorized investigator, he told her he had resigned from his position. \nHe failed to disclose to the OPM investigator the fact that the company sent him a letter \nfiring him after he had tendered his resignation. At his hearing, he denied discussing his \nworkplace problems with the investigator, although he certified as true the investigator\u2019s \nsummary which included that information. He acknowledged that he had applied for \nunemployment benefits. At his hearing, for the first time, he also acknowledged that his \nemployer informed the unemployment commission that he had been fired for cause, and \nhe was then required to repay the unemployment benefits that he had received. \n \n \n2 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant\u2019s level of \neducation and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to \ndisclose past-due debts on a security clearance application was deliberate. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant denied deliberately falsifying his answer to Question 20. However, he \nprovided his employer\u2019s letter of termination as an exhibit for the record. His denial was \nnot credible, and he failed to provide a credible reason for failing to inform the \ngovernment that he had been fired.  \n \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant also denied he told the government investigator that he \nhad resigned from his position. His statement at the hearing was not credible.3 I believe \nhe did in fact tell the OPM investigator he resigned, and he did not disclose his receipt \nof the termination letter. \n \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s decision to conceal his unacceptable workplace behavior \nand to conceal his dismissal for cause from his position as a manager made him \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. These facts, if known, would affect \nhis personal and professional standing.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statement falls outside the scope of the conduct alleged in the SOR. In ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which \nconduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation;(d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e)  to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3. \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-09232 vat 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (stating that \ninconsistent statements in exhibits may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility and \nevaluating mitigation and rehabilitation evidence even though they are not cited in the SOR as raising a \nsecurity concern.) I have considered Applicant\u2019s non-SOR statement that he did not tell the investigator \nthat he had resigned from his job and did not discuss his workplace problems with the investigator for the \npurposes of (a), (b), (c), and (e) and not for any other purpose.  \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n \n \n \nI thoroughly reviewed the documentary and testamentary evidence in this case. I \nobserved Applicant carefully, and I noted his demeanor and how he responded to \nquestions about answering Question 20 and his interview with an OPM investigator in \nOctober 2007. I also listened carefully to his responses to questions posed during his \nsecurity clearance hearing in order to assess his credibility and state of mind. I conclude \nthat there is sufficient record evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d response to \nQuestion 20 and his statement to the OPM investigator that he had resigned from his \nposition with Company A were willful and deliberate falsifications. I conclude that none \nof the Guideline E mitigating conditions applies to the facts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and \n1.d. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n12 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 55 \nyears. He has held several managerial positions and was aware of his role and \nresponsibilities as a manager. Nevertheless, his behavior toward his subordinates was \ninvestigated by his employer and found to violate expected behaviors for managers. \n \nApplicant was not a credible witness. He resigned from his position, and then his \nemployer sent him a letter terminating his employment. After receiving his termination \nnotice, he applied for unemployment benefits. When his employer told the \nunemployment commission that Applicant had been fired for cause, Applicant was \nrequired to repay the unemployment compensation he had received. In his response to \nQuestion 20 on his SF-86, Applicant did not reveal that he left employment under \nadverse circumstances.  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reviewed his personal subject \ninterview. He made one correction, but he did not dispute that he told an OPM \ninvestigator that he had resigned from his employment after having some problems with \nother employees. At his hearing, however, Applicant denied telling the investigator \nabout his workplace issues. I believe Applicant did in fact provide the information \nreported by the OPM investigator in her summary of Applicant\u2019s personal subject \ninterview on October 23, 2007. I found his testimony denying the accuracy of the \nsummary to be unreliable and lacking in credibility. \n \nApplicant saw a psychologist briefly at the request of his employer, but he has \nnot sought professional counseling or treatment for his unacceptable behavior in the \nworkplace. The false information he provided is recent and serious. He has not taken \nresponsibility for his failure to be candid about his work record. He failed to provide   \nevidence of rehabilitation, and he failed to establish that the behavior would not recur, \nraising ongoing concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude, \nafter a careful review of the facts of his case, the personal conduct adjudicative \nguideline, and the whole-person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n                                    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Savarino, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on August 24,\n2006. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B on February 19, 2009.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 16, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 3, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nAugust 31, 2009\n\nGE 1; Tr. 34-38, 68-71.\n1\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request on April 6, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on May 12, 2009, and I received the case assignment on May 15, 2009.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on June 16, 2009. The government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which\nwere received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness\ntestified on his behalf. He submitted six exhibits (AE) A through F, which were received\nand admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on June 16, 2009.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 24, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice, but the date is\nunknown. (Tr. 10) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15\ndays notice before the hearing. Through counsel, Applicant affirmatively waived his right\nto 15 days notice. (Id.) \nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant submitted a formal request that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to Pakistan. The requests and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Hearing\nExhibits I-VIII and A-1 through A-4. The facts administratively noticed will be limited to\nmatters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute, and are\nset out in the Findings of Fact below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the\nSOR.\nApplicant, who is 44 years old, works as a sales engineer and software\nconsultant for a Department of Defense contractor. Applicant has held a security\nclearance since 1995 without any violations of security procedures. \nApplicant was born in Pakistan. His father immigrated to the United States (U.S.)\nin 1980. Slowly, his father invited family members to join him in the U.S. Applicant\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1985 and became a naturalized citizen in 1992. All his\nimmediate family members immigrated to the U.S. Except for his mother, all his family\nmembers are U.S. citizens and residents. His mother resides in the U.S. and is a\npermanent resident. Applicant has a large extended family in the U.S. He graduated\nfrom a major U.S. university with a bachelor of science degree in computer science in\n1991.  \n1\n\nGE 1; Tr. 42-43.\n2\nTr. 47-57, 84-89.\n3\nTr. 51, 64.\n4\nId. 44-46, 82-63.\n5\nId. 59-62, 80-81.\n6\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife, who is 36 years old, was born in Pakistan. They met in Pakistan\nin 1991. She immigrated to the U.S. in 1992 after they became engaged. They married\nin the U.S. in 1992. She became a U.S. citizen in 1997. They have three children, two\nsons, ages 16 and 13, and a daughter, age 8. Their children are U.S. citizens by birth\nand U.S. residents.2\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are deceased. His wife has three\nbrothers and four sisters who are citizens of and residents in Pakistan. Six are married.\nShe calls her family in Pakistan about once a month and talks with whomever is at the\nhouse she calls. She does not talk with all her family members on a monthly basis.\nApplicant talks with them less frequently. His closest relationship is with her youngest\nbrother, who is 25 years old and a student. His wife\u2019s two remaining brothers are\nfarmers and her four sisters are housewives. One wife\u2019s husband owns rental\nproperties. He does not know the occupation of his sisters-in-law husbands.3\nApplicant provides his 25-year-old brother-in-law with some financial support. He\nsends him approximately $150 a month. He does not provide any other financial support\nfor his wife\u2019s family members. Neither he nor his wife own any real property in Pakistan.\nHe invested in some stock in Pakistan, which is now worth between $2,000 and $3,000.\nHis assets in the U.S. include a house with $200,000 in equity, a retirement account\nworth approximately $100,000, and a $63,000 state college savings account for his\nchildren.4\nApplicant has two uncles who are citizens of and residents in Pakistan. One\nuncle is semi-retired. This uncle and his wife have immigrant visas and travel between\nthe U.S. and Pakistan. He visits with this uncle and his wife when they are in the U.S.\nHis other uncle is a professor of agriculture in Pakistan. Applicant has no regular\ncontact with this uncle. He sees this uncle during his trips to Pakistan. In four years, he\nreceived one e-mail from this uncle.  \n5\nApplicant and his wife traveled to Pakistan three times in the last ten years and\nhis wife traveled to Pakistan once on her own. They entered Pakistan on their U.S.\npassports. In 2008, they learned that if they had a Pakistani identification (I.D.) card,\nthey would not need to acquire documentation from the U.S. for their trips. He has this\nI.D. card. During their March 2008 trip, his wife\u2019s mother died. While in Pakistan, they\nstayed with his in-laws. They visited with her family. His mother cannot travel to\nPakistan and his father\u2019s travels are seldom because of his age.  \n6\n\nId. 24-32, 58-59, 62-64.\n7\nAE C; Tr. 47-49, 60-61, 85-86, 88, 93.\n8\nTr. 34-36, 74-75.\n9\n4\nApplicant\u2019s in-laws do not know anything about his work, where he works, or that\nhe holds a clearance. They only know that he works with computers.  When in Pakistan,\nApplicant has not been approached by anyone inquiring about his work and how he\nearned his living. He always notified his security office when he traveled to Pakistan.\nBecause of his security training at work, Applicant knew what to do if approached for\nwork information. His security officer confirmed that he complies with the security rules\nand that he also protected company proprietary information and export data.7\n \nAfter his wife became a citizen, she applied for immigrant status for her family\nmembers in Pakistan, including the husband of the one sister who was married at that\ntime. On June 15, 2009, after waiting more than 10 years, they received notice that her\nsiblings had been granted permission to immigrate to the U.S. The family looks forward\nto coming to the U.S. Applicant and his wife are in the process of completing the\nnecessary paperwork for her family to immigrate. Because all of his wife\u2019s siblings are\nmarried, except her youngest brother, they will need to work with the U.S. immigration\nservices to assure his wife\u2019s siblings\u2019 spouses and children also immigrate. Applicant\nbelieves this issue will be resolved. He anticipates that her family members will be in the\nU.S. within a year. Applicant and his wife have no desire to return to Pakistan.8\n Applicant\u2019s home town and his in-laws residence is located in eastern Pakistan\nclose to Pakistan\u2019s border with India. The Northern Frontier Province (NWFB) is located\nseveral hundred miles north of Applicant\u2019s family home and near the Afghanistan\nborder. The family and Applicant have not traveled to this area because the NWFB\nresidents speak a different language, have different customs, and live different lives. His\nwife\u2019s family has not been subjected to terrorist threats or attacks and are not political\nactivists. His wife\u2019s family members have not been targeted by the Pakistani\ngovernment.   \n9\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Pakistan is an Islamic\nparliamentary democracy with a poor human rights record. Nevertheless, Pakistan\nremains a principal ally of the U.S. and has actively cooperated with the U.S. in the\nglobal war on terrorism. Despite this, terrorist groups, such as the Taliban and al-Qaida,\noperate in Pakistan, making safety and security an issue. These terrorist organizations\ntarget not only Pakistani interests, but U.S. and Afghan interests by suicide operations,\nbombings, assassinations, car-jacking, assaults, or hostage taking. The Pakistani\ngovernment, with U.S. support, recently increased its efforts to contain and eliminate\nterrorists operations within its borders. At this time, the risk of terrorist activities remain\nextremely high, especially in the NWPB province.\n\n5\nPakistan is not on the National Counter Intelligence Center\u2019s list of the most\nactive nations engaging in foreign economic collection and industrial espionage.\nPakistan is not known to be an active collector of U.S. intelligence information, nor is it\nknown to target its expatriate former citizens to obtain U.S. information.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family, which includes his wife, children, parents, and\nsiblings, are U.S. citizens and residents. Thus, no security concern is raised by these\nfamily members. The siblings of Applicant\u2019s wife are citizens and residents of Pakistan.\nHe has two uncles who are citizens of Pakistan. One uncle lives in Pakistan and one\nlives between the U.S. and Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains a normal, but limited,\nfamilial relationship with her sisters and brothers. She talks with siblings who are at\n\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not\n10\nbe mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not in a position to be exploited.\nThe Appeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise\nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice between the\ninterest of the family member and the interest of the United States. (See ISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd,\nApr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)). Thus, an administrative judge was not\npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.\n7\nhome when she makes her monthly telephone call. Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts with\nhis in-laws is less frequent. Applicant and his wife visited her family in 1999, 2004, and\n2008. His wife also visited her family in 2002. Applicant provides limited financial\nsupport to his wife\u2019s youngest brother in Pakistan. His family relationships are not per se\na reason to deny Applicant a security clearance, but his contacts with his wife\u2019s family\nmembers must be considered in deciding whether to grant Applicant a clearance. The\ngovernment must establish that these family relationships create a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, coercion, or risk of terrorism,\nor would create a potential conflict of interest between his obligations to protect\nsensitive information and his desire to help his family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of\nPakistan and terrorist organizations within Pakistan. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809\n(App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an applicant could be targeted for manipulation\nor induced into compromising classified information is real, not theoretical. Applicant\nand his wife\u2019s relationship and contacts with her sisters and brothers in Pakistan raises\na heightened risk of security concerns because of the activities of terrorist\norganizations in Pakistan as the terrorist threats to safety and security is greater than\nconcerns that the Pakistani government will seek classified information. The information\nof record fails to show that the Pakistani government engages in espionage activities in\nthe U.S. or that it targets U.S. citizens in the U.S. or Pakistan by exploiting,\nmanipulating, pressuring, or coercing them to obtain protected information. \nUnder the new guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests.  In determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in Pakistan cause security concerns, I\n10\nconsidered that Pakistan and the U.S. have a close relationship and that Pakistan is\ncooperating with the U.S. in the fight against terrorism, including taking new and\nincreased actions against terrorists in its country. There is no evidence that the\nPakistani government targets U.S. citizens for protected information. The human rights\nissues in Pakistan continue to be a concern and the terrorist organizations, not the\nPakistani government, target U.S. citizens and U.S. interests in Pakistan. While none of\nthese considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be\nconsidered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because his\nwife\u2019s family members live in Pakistan. Because of the significant activities of terrorist\norganizations in Pakistan, Applicant\u2019s trips to Pakistan and contacts with his and his\nwife\u2019s family in Pakistan raise a heightened risk concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\n\n8\nIn deciding if Applicant has established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8 , I must consider:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s normal relationship with her family members is not a basis to\ndeny him a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires more\nthan statements about the limited scope of her conversations with her brothers and\nsisters. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). His wife\u2019s family\nmembers have never held a political position. Her family members have not been\ntargeted by the Pakistani government or terrorists. His immediate family members are\ncitizens and residents of the U.S. He owns no property in Pakistan and has minimal\nfinancial assets in Pakistan. Balancing these factors as well as Pakistani\u2019s cooperation\nin counterterrorism, and the lack of evidence that the Pakistani government targets U.S.\ncitizens for protected information against the risk of terrorism, I find that Applicant would\nresolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interests. Likewise, any threats by terrorist\norganizations against Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family in Pakistan would be resolved in favor of\nU.S. interests. His loyalties are to the U.S., not Pakistan or terrorist organizations.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to his family contacts\nspecified in the SOR under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n9\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant emigrated from Pakistan 24 years ago as a young man. He has lived his\nentire adult life in the U.S. His values and preferences have been guided by his\nexperiences in the U.S., leading to his decision to become a U.S. citizen in 1992. His\nimmediate family is in the U.S. Two brothers-in-law work as farmers in Pakistan, one\nbrother-in-law is a student, and his four sisters-in-law are housewives. The evidence\ndoes not show that members of his wife\u2019s family or his two uncles are connected to the\nPakistani government and its day to day operations. His in-laws live quietly. They are\nnot political activists nor do they have any connection with terrorists. Once her family\nmembers arrive in the U.S., these concerns will no longer exist.\nAlthough his wife has regular contact with her siblings, Applicant has limited\ncontact with his in-laws. These contacts could, under certain circumstances, raise a\nserious security concern. Those circumstances are not present in this case because the\nPakistani government does not conduct espionage activities against the U.S. The\nrecord lacks any evidence that the Pakistani government seeks to obtain classified\ndocuments from the U.S. and thus, it is highly unlikely that the Pakistani government will\nattempt to coerce, pressure, or exploit U.S. citizens to obtain classified information.\nWhile there remains a serious human rights issue in Pakistan, there is little likelihood\nthat Applicant will be placed in a position to provide classified information to the\nPakistan government or that his family members will be harmed by the Pakistani\ngovernment given its present relationship with the U.S. The threat of harm from\nterrorists organizations is real and significant. However, with U.S. help, Pakistan is\ntaking much more aggressive action against terrorism within its borders near\nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s in-laws live many miles from where the terrorists reside and\nattack. They have not been exposed to terrorist acts. After considering all the evidence\nof record, I find that overall, there is little risk that Applicant will violate the security\n\n10\nprocedures by providing classified information to the government of Pakistan as a result\nof terrorist activities. His loyalties to the U.S. are deep and long. The U.S. is home, not\nPakistan.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline B. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The SOR was received on April 22, 2009. \n \n  \nOn April 29, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJune 25, 2009, I was assigned the case. On June 26, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing, which was to be held on July 14, 2009. On July 13, \n2009, Applicant requested and was granted a continuance. On August 10, 2009, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing, which was to be held on September \n1, 2009. On August 31, 2009, another continuance was requested when Applicant\u2019s \nrepresentation stated he had just been retained. A continuance was again granted. On \nSeptember 14, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing, which \nwas held on October 14, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 8, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and offered one document, which was \nadmitted into evidence as Ex. A. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On October 30, 2009, additional information was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel having no objection, it was admitted into the record as Ex. B \nthrough Ex. I. On October 19, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i as she asserts these debts have been satisfied. She \nadmitted the factual allegations, with explanations, in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and \n1.o of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old diplomatic security officer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since August 2007. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 6, 2007, credit bureau report (CBR) lists judgments filed \nagainst Applicant by six creditors between August 2002 and June 2005. (Ex. 7) In \nNovember 2002, a $3,896 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was entered against Applicant. (Ex. 3, \nEx. 7) In February 2003, a $639 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was entered against Applicant. \n(Ex. 4, Ex. 7) In January 2009, this judgment was paid in full. (Ex H) In January 2006, a \n$577 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.k) was entered against Applicant. (Ex. 5, Ex. 7) This judgment \nhas not been paid. In January 2006, Applicant satisfied a $1,908 judgment entered \nagainst her for delinquent rent. (Ex. B) The judgment had been entered against her in \nJune 2005. (Ex. 7) This judgment was not alleged as an obligation of concern in the \nSOR.  \n \n \nOn April 14, 2004, Applicant completed a sworn affidavit addressing her past due \nfinancial obligations. (Ex. 9) As of April 2004, Applicant\u2019s net monthly remainder \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n(monthly net gross income less monthly expenses and monthly debt payments) was \napproximately $1,000. (Ex. 9) She stated she had filed for bankruptcy three times in the \npast seven years. She stated in 1997, she had taken on too much credit card debt and \nwas unable to manage that debt. (Ex. 9) In December 1997, she filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection. In May 1998, the plan was dismissed due to failure to make her \nrequired payments. (Ex. 12) In August 1998, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nresulting in the discharge of her debts. (Ex. 11) In November 2001, she filed for Chapter \n13, wage earner\u2019s plan, bankruptcy protection. On March 18, 2002, the bankruptcy was \ndismissed. (Ex. 10) \n \n \nIn April 2005, while working as a civilian employee, the Department of the Navy \nCentral Adjudication Facility (DON CAF) issued a letter of intent (LOI) to Deny Security \nClearance and Eligibility for Assignment to a Sensitive Position. An SOR which \naccompanied the LOI listed nine collection accounts, four judgments, two garnishments, \nthree bad debts, and one account past due. In her response to the LOI, Applicant \nindicated a number of the listed debts had been paid in full. Her commander\u2019s letter of \nAugust 2005, stated Applicant asserted she had resolved her outstanding debts, but \nfailed to document her assertions. She provided no evidence that any payment \narrangement had been made. (Ex. 8) Applicant left her job after she appealed her denial \nand before a final denial was issued. \n \n \nIn October 2005, the DON CAF issued a letter of Final Denial (LOD) of Security \nClearance and Eligibility for Assignment to Sensitive Position stating Applicant had \nfailed to provide documented proof of her effort to resolve or make arrangements for \npayment to her creditors. Additionally, her clearance was denied because her financial \nproblems continued after her bankruptcies. (Ex. 8)  \n \n \nOn December 8, 2005, Applicant appealed the DON CAF\u2019s denial of her security \nclearance. The DON found her appeal raised no new information to support \nreconsideration. Applicant failed to show the debts were being resolved and failed to \nprovide evidence she was trying to pay her debts. (Ex. 8) On May 25, 2006, the \nDepartment of Navy Personnel Security Appeals Board (PSAB) upheld the denial of her \nsecurity clearance and eligibility for assignment to sensitive positions.  \n \n \nThe April 2005 SOR and the January 2009 SOR list four of the same unpaid \nobligations. The $7,670 judgment resulting from an involuntary vehicle repossession \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) is listed in both. The $3,897 judgment resulting from a vehicle repossession \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) is listed in both. The $639 judgment resulting from a fitness club \nmembership (SOR \u00b6 1.f) is listed in both. This debt had been placed for collection (SOR \n\u00b6 1.h) before it went to judgment.  \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant answered written interrogatories concerning her \nfinancial obligations. At that time, her net monthly income was approximately $1,800, \nher monthly expenses were $400, and her monthly net remainder was approximately \n$1,400. Ex. 2) In Applicant\u2019s response to the written interrogatories, she indicated \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \ncertain debts have been fully paid. She attached documents showing her car loan on \nher 1996 Honda had been paid in full, two medical bills were paid, and payments made \nto nine other accounts. (Ex. 2) \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant sought assistance from a law firm to work with the \ncredit bureaus and her creditors. (Ex. C) It was asserted the CBRs were inaccurate, \ninvalid, or unverifiable. However, no specific basis to dispute the legitimacy of any of the \npast-due debts in the SOR was shown. Nor did she provide any documentation \nsupporting a disputed debt.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted a document showing she had paid an \nattorney to file for bankruptcy protection two days prior and that her $1,929 student loan \nwas paid-in-full. (Ex. A, Ex. G) This was not a debt of concern listed in the SOR. Since \nApril 2009, when Applicant received the SOR, she has not made payment on any of the \nobligations listed in the SOR.  \n \n \nThe SOR lists three unpaid judgments and eight accounts placed for collection, \nwhich totaled approximately $20,000. A summary of those debts follows:  \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na Bank account placed \nfor collection.  \n$417 \nOn March 12, 2009, $313.50 was paid. (Ex. \nD) \nb Involuntary automobile \nrepossesion.  \n$7,670 \n \nUnpaid. This debt was also listed in April 23, \n2005 SOR.

(Ex. 8) \ng Collection company \ncollecting a medical \naccount. \n$92 \nApplicant asserts there is a zero balance on \nthis account.

Applicant failed to \ndocument that payments have been \nmade.  \nk \nJudgment obtained in \nJanuary 2006. \n$577 \nUnpaid.  \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n$19,374 \nApplicant has addressed four of the \ndebts (a, d, f, and i), which total $1,846. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be negligent, \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has resorted to bankruptcy protection three times in the past and \ntwo days before the hearing, she paid an attorney to again file for bankruptcy protection. \nApplicant has two unpaid judgments and four other past due obligations that total \napproximately $17,500. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nPrior to receipt of the SOR, Applicant paid five debts totaling approximately \n$2,300: \u00b6 1.a ($417), \u00b6 1.d ($173), \u00b6 1.f ($639), \u00b6 1.h ($431), and \u00b6 1.i ($617). AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies to these five debts. She also paid two obligations not listed in the SOR. In \nJanuary 2006, she paid a $1,900 judgment for delinquent rent and in June 2005, she \npaid her $1,929 student loan.  \n \nThe six remaining debts are unpaid. Applicant meets none of the mitigating \nfactors for these obligations. Her financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and \ndid not occur under circumstances not likely to recur. She failed to demonstrate that her \ndebts were largely due to circumstances beyond her control, or that she has acted \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibly in addressing her debts. Further, she has not sought credit counseling, or \notherwise brought the problem under control as her circumstances permitted.  \n \nApplicant should have been acutely aware of the government\u2019s concern about \nher delinquent financial obligations. In October 2005, the Navy denied her a security \nclearance stating she had failed to provide proof of her effort to resolve or make \narrangements to her creditors. In December 2005, she appealed that denial. After she \nleft the Navy, the denial was upheld. This should have put her on notice that her unpaid \ndebts were of security concern.  \n \nTwo of the debts listed in her most recent SOR were also alleged in the DON \nCAF SOR. These two debts, SOR \u00b6 1.b ($7,670) and SOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,897), both resulted \nfrom vehicle repossessions. One debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was reduced to judgment in \nNovember 2002 and has yet to be paid.  \n \nThe mitigating factors listed in AG \u00b6 20(a) do not apply to the remaining unpaid \nobligations. The debts are not infrequent, nor did they occur under such circumstances \nthat are unlikely to recur. Applicant=s financial problems have existed for a long period of \ntime. She has had to resort to bankruptcy protection four times, the most recent filing \nbeing two days before her hearing. Her unpaid obligations do cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nThere has been no showing her financial problems were caused by events \nbeyond her control. AG & 20(b) does not apply. Under AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), \nApplicant has paid five of the eleven debts. The total amount of unpaid debt is \napproximately $17,500. Since receiving the SOR in April 2009, she has not made a \npayment on the SOR debts. AG & 20(c) does not apply. \n \nAG & 20(e) does not apply. In September 2008, Applicant retained a law firm to \nassist her in working with the credit bureaus and her creditors. Applicant failed to \ndocument a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of any past-due. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. An applicant is not \nrequired to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has failed \nto do this.  \n \n \nApplicant has an unpaid judgment obtained against her in 2002. In 2005, the \nNavy denied her a security clearance. Her appeal in the matter was denied. This should \nhave put her on notice that her unpaid debts were of security concern and that paying \nher debts or arranging a repayment plan was necessary. However, since receiving the \nSOR, she has taken no effective action to resolve her debts, and has not equipped \nherself to avoid financial problems in the future. She has not made a single payment on \nher past due obligations. Nor has she contacted her creditors to establish a repayment \nplan. The mere hiring of an attorney in preparation of filing for bankruptcy protection is \ninsufficient to establish she has taken effective action to resolve her debts. There is no \nevidence a bankruptcy has been filed. There is no guarantee that even if a bankruptcy \npetition has been or were to be filed that a discharge of creditors would occur. Applicant \nhas previously had two bankruptcy petitions dismissed. \n \n \nI find Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is no \nindication that the problem is being resolved or is under control. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b and 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h and 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j and 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 31-year-old logistics manager/assistant program manager employed by a defense contractor. He joined the U.S. Army in August 1987, and served five years on active duty. He was discharged in August 2002, after completing his time in service. He achieved the rank of specialist (E-4), and his service was characterized as honorable (AE 4). Applicant\u2019s good performance in the Army is reflected in his awards, which include an Army Commendation Medal, a Certificate of Achievement, and a Good Conduct Medal. Applicant married his wife in August 2001. He has three children. Two of the children, ages 10 and 6, were born of this marriage. His six year-old son was diagnosed as autistic in 2005. His third child, also age 10, was born out of wedlock from a prior relationship. Appellant claimed he did not know he was the father of his third child until 2007, when he was required to start providing financial support in the amount of $346 a month. After his discharge from the Army, Applicant was unemployed and/or underemployed for approximately one year.

He failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 10, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). On February 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nAugust 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n(Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ndenied or revoked. \n \nOn March 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 24, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 5, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on May 28, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 22. I left the record open to allow Applicant time to submit additional \ndocumentary information. He timely submitted AE 23. All Applicant\u2019s exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 2, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old logistics manager/assistant program manager \nemployed by a defense contractor. He joined the U.S. Army in August 1987, and served \nfive years on active duty. He was discharged in August 2002, after completing his time \nin service. He achieved the rank of specialist (E-4), and his service was characterized \nas honorable (AE 4). Applicant\u2019s good performance in the Army is reflected in his \nawards, which include an Army Commendation Medal, a Certificate of Achievement, \nand a Good Conduct Medal. \n \nApplicant married his wife in August 2001. He has three children. Two of the \nchildren, ages 10 and 6, were born of this marriage. His six year-old son was diagnosed \nas autistic in 2005. His third child, also age 10, was born out of wedlock from a prior \nrelationship. Appellant claimed he did not know he was the father of his third child until \n2007, when he was required to start providing financial support in the amount of $346 a \nmonth. \n \nAfter his discharge from the Army, Applicant was unemployed and/or \nunderemployed for approximately one year. During this period, his wife also was \n \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, \n2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nunemployed, and she delivered their youngest son. Applicant supported his family with \nhis unemployment benefits and by taking occasional, low paying temporary jobs.  \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant was hired by a government contractor providing logistics \nservice to a government agency. In April 2007, his employer lost the government \ncontract. Because of his outstanding job performance during the previous four years, \nthe government agency recommended to the incoming contractor that it retain Applicant \nin his position. In May 2007, he was hired by his current employer, another government \ncontractor, and has been working for the same employer since. Applicant supervises \nfour other employees. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of his immediate supervisor (a \nNavy retiree with 21 years of service) (Tr. 26-34). Applicant discussed his financial \nproblems with his supervisor and sought his supervisor\u2019s assistance with his financial \nproblems. The supervisor has observed Applicant during the last two years on a daily \nbasis, including many work weekends. He considers Applicant to be one of the most \ndependable and reliable employees in the company. The president of Applicant\u2019s \ncompany and the chief operating officer requested Applicant receive access to \nclassified information. In their opinions, Applicant\u2019s work and professionalism has been \nabove reproach. They believe Applicant has matured during the last two years. \n \nApplicant is considered to be a valuable employee not only by his supervisors, \nbut also by the government agency\u2019s personnel. Because of his excellent job \nperformance, he was selected by the government agency to attend specialized Lean Six \nSigma training. Applicant\u2019s excellent performance is further evidenced in his character \nreference letters (AE 1-3). Applicant has established a reputation as a reliable and \ntrustworthy employee. He has consistently exceeded performance expectations for the \ncontract he manages. \n \nApplicant attended college from August 2006 to March 2007, and completed \napproximately 20 college credits. He paid for his education using student loans, and \nowes approximately $10,000 (Tr. 64). Because he stopped attending college, his \nstudent loans became due. Applicant requested a one-year deferment which will expire \nin the summer of 2009. He did not continue his college education because he was \nselected to attend job-related training.  \n \nApplicant attributes his current financial problems to three main causes: the \nperiod of unemployment and underemployment he experienced when he departed the \nArmy; the additional expenses associated with taking care of his autistic son; and his \nwife\u2019s inability to work. Because of his limited income, he could not afford to pay both \nhis past financial obligations and his family\u2019s day-to-day living expenses.  \n \nIn July 2007, he submitted a security clearance application in which he disclosed \nhaving a car repossessed in 2006, and problems with paying his state taxes. His \nbackground investigation addressed his financial status and included the review of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAugust 2007 and January 2009 credit bureau reports (CBRs), and Applicant\u2019s answers \nto a September 2008 DOHA interrogatory.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $15,000, which have been delinquent for a number of years. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted these were his debts and that they are \noutstanding. The debts are also established by the admitted CBRs. At his hearing, \nApplicant disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.i and 1.j. He disputed SOR \u00b6 1.e ($130), because he \nbelieved his wife paid it. He disputed SOR \u00b6 1.i ($440), because he returned the cable \nT.V. company\u2019s equipment and was not given credit for it. He disputed SOR \u00b6 1.j \n($671), because he did not recognize the creditor.  \n \nAfter his hearing, I allowed Applicant additional time to submit documentation \nshowing he had paid, properly disputed, or made efforts to contact his creditors in an \nattempt to resolve any of his debts. He failed to provide such information. I find that all \nthe alleged SOR debts are Applicant\u2019s debts and that they have been outstanding for a \nnumber of years. Applicant also has student loans that were deferred and will become \ndue during the summer of 2009 (not alleged in the SOR). \n \nThe largest debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f ($8,627)) concerns a repossessed car that Applicant \nbought for his wife in 2006. Applicant bought his wife a used car so that she could \ncommute to work. However, her professional license was suspended for failure to pay \nstate taxes and she has not been able to work since. He returned the car because he \ncould not afford the payments. Many of the remaining delinquent debts could be \nconsidered small debts since they are for $1,000 or less.  \n \nApplicant has had financial problems since 2002-2003. He has not been making \nenough money to pay his bills and for his family\u2019s day-to-day living expenses. Applicant \ntestified he received some financial counseling while in the Army. He claimed he \nentered into a debt consolidation program in 2005 when he and his wife tried to improve \ntheir credit to purchase a home. He presented no evidence to corroborate this claim. He \nalso stated he was in the process of seeking financial counseling from his bank. \nNotwithstanding, he failed to submit a working budget, evidence of lifestyle changes, or \na plan to resolve his ongoing financial problems. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He was candid and \nforthcoming explaining the circumstances surrounding his financial problems. He \nclaimed he was not deliberately ignoring his financial obligations, and that he was \nmaking efforts to resolve his financial problems. He failed to present evidence of such \nefforts. I believe he is not aware of what is required of him to show that he is reliable, \ntrustworthy, and financially responsible.  \n \nApplicant highlighted that he has served his country well during the last 11 years, \nboth in the Army and working for contractors providing services to a government \nagency. He believes that because of his performance and service record, his financial \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nproblems do not make him a security risk or concern. There is no evidence that \nApplicant ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 10 delinquent and/or charged off debts that have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. The debts are Applicant\u2019s debts as established by the \nevidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions. Applicant presented no evidence he has paid, \nsettled, or properly disputed any of the alleged debts. Applicant does not have the \nfinancial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, and his day-to-day living \nexpenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established that his financial problems resulted from circumstances \nbeyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his one-year period \nof unemployment and underemployment; his status as the sole provider for his family; \nand the additional expenses related to taking care of his autistic son. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies, but does not fully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not \nsufficient to show he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He presented little \nevidence of debt payments, contacts with creditors, settlement or negotiations of debts, \nor that he has properly disputed any of his debts. I also find he is financially \noverextended and his financial problems are not under control.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), and (e) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not yet under control. He also failed to show he made good-faith efforts to resolve \nhis debts. AG \u00b6 20(f) does not apply.  \n \n \nDespite partial applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), financial considerations concerns are \nnot mitigated. Applicant is financially overextended. He lacks the income to bring his \ndebts to current status. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a good husband and \nfather. He honorably served five years in the Army. He has successfully worked for a \ndefense agency (as employee of two defense contractors) for approximately six years. \nThere is no evidence he has ever compromised classified information or committed any \nsecurity violations. Applicant expressed remorse for his financial mistakes and promised \nto repay his creditors. He established circumstances beyond his control contributing to \nhis inability to pay his debts. These factors show responsibility, good judgment, and \nmitigation. \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant has been consistently employed since July 2003. \nHe presented little documentary evidence of efforts to resolve his debts. There are no \nclear indications that his financial problem is being resolved or is under control. His \ninability to pay even relatively small debts shows he is financially overextended. He \ndoes not have the financial means to resolve his financial problems. On balance, I \nconclude Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 30, 2007. On October 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nfor Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006.\nApril 20, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 10, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed,\nand I received the case assignment on January 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 2, 2009, for a hearing on February 18, 2008, which was convened\nas scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits that were admitted in\nevidence without objection (Exhs. 1-4). Applicant testified on her own behalf and\nsubmitted 15 documents that were admitted without objection (Exhs. A-O). DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts totaling $22,000 which were alleged in\n22 allegations in the SOR. In her answer, she admitted three of the allegations and\ndenied the remaining ones. She amended her answer after additional information\nbecame available to her and submitted it at the hearing (Exh. B). She is a 43-year-old\nemployee of a Department of Defense contractor who has worked for the company\nsince August 2007. She was married in 2005, and has four step-children. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose as a result of major back surgery in 2004 that\ncaused her to be unable to work full time for four years until she began her present job.\nDuring that four year period she earned only $30,000 (Exh. C). She believed her\ninsurance would cover most of the medical costs. However, after a dispute regarding\nthe choice of a doctor, the company paid only half of the $30,000 in medical and\nhospital charges (Exh. A and Tr. 17). The result was that she had extensive debts that\nbecame delinquent. She has now consolidated all the remaining medical debts and is\nmaking monthly payments through a debt consolidation service (Exh. K). \nAn analysis of the current status of the delinquent debts listed on the SOR\nindicates that the largest number of debts and the largest amounts of approximately\n$18,000 are for the medical expenses incurred as a result of the surgery in 2004. The\nfollowing is a list of the debts listed on the SOR and their status:\n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a.: Credit card debt of $109 paid in full in October, 2008 (Exhs. E and\nN).\n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b.: Animal hospital debt of $73 paid in full in December 2008 (Exh. F).\n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c.: A second debt to another animal hospital of $88 paid in full in\nNovember 2008 (Exh. G). This is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.u.\n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d.: Medical bill of $78 paid November 2008 (Exh. G). \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e.: Medical bill of $43 paid November 2008 (Exh. G). \n\n3\n6. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and g.: Medical bills of $477, and $288 settled for $508 in\nDecember 2008 (Exh. H). \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.h.: Credit card debt of $528 paid in November 08 (Exh. G). \n8. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i.: Hospital bill of $2,664 now included in debt consolidation program\n(Exh. J).\n9. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j.,r.,and s.: Three debts totaling $578 that are not on credit reports\nand are being disputed by Applicant (Tr. 51 and 52). \n10. SOR \u00b6 1.k.: Medical bill of $144 paid in December 2008 (Exh. I, and Tr. 27). \n11. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l.,m.,n.,o.,and p.: Medical bills totaling approximately $16,000 now\nconsolidated in debt management program with monthly payments (Exh. K).\nBefore the consolidation program was initiated, Applicant was making partial\npayments on these accounts through a collection service bureau (Exh. J). \n12. SOR \u00b6 1.q.: Medical bill of $259 paid in full in December 2008 (Exh. L). \n13. SOR \u00b6 1.t.: Medical bill of $62 paid in full in October 2008 (Exh. N). \n14. SOR \u00b6 1.v.: Court costs of $135 for divorce proceeding paid in full in March\n2008 (Exh. O). \nIn summary, Applicant has paid most of the smaller accounts, except for the\nthree that she disputes. She began her payments to the credit consolidation service in\nNovember 2008 with payments of $654 per month for several months. Since a number\nof bills have now been paid through the program, the monthly payments have been\nreduced to $400 which will result in all delinquent accounts being paid in the next five\nyears. Applicant is an hourly rate employee who is paid $15.50 per hour. She is paid\nbetween $800 and $1,000 bi-weekly. Her husband is paid $1,800 bi-weekly. They pay\ndifferent expenses from their respective incomes. Payments on her debts come from\nher income which is adequate to make the required monthly payments necessary to\nresolve the debts (Tr. 63). \nApplicant\u2019s husband inherited money from his mother recently and some of it was\nused to pay some of her debts. She also had cosmetic surgery in 2007 before she had\nfully determined the extent of the medical debts incurred from 2004. That bill was\nfinanced with the help of her husband and is paid (Tr. 66).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant incurred delinquent debts over several years and most\nwere unresolved. The government established sufficient facts to raise a security concern.\nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20 (b), the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant had extensive medical\nproblems which resulted in several years of low income. Those factors were the primary\ncause of most of the indebtedness. Until recently, her income was insufficient to allow\nher to resolve all the debts.\nWhile the debts have been owed for several years, I conclude that the Applicant\nhas done all that she could have done with her income to resolve the debts until recently.\nShe has worked since 2007 for her employer and her income is sufficient to allow her to\nresolve all of the accumulated debts. She understands the impact of debts on her ability\nto hold a security clearance. Thus, I conclude that she has acted responsibly and the\nmitigating condition is applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20 (c) the security concern may be mitigated if the person received\ncounseling or the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant is in a debt\nconsolidation program and the financial problem is being resolved with many debts now\npaid and the remainder in the program. These facts are sufficient to apply the mitigating\ncondition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(d) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nAlthough some of the debts have not been paid most of them relate to her medical bills.\nShe has made substantial efforts to resolve the debts, and, from the evidence presented,\nI find this mitigating condition is also applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n6\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and responsible person who\nincurred medical expenses through no fault of her own. She has taken steps to resolve\nmany of them, and has a program to resolve the remainder. She and her husband have\nadequate income to avoid further indebtedness, and there is little likelihood of a\nrecurrence of financial problems. There is no potential for pressure or exploitation. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed key element in the whole person analysis for\nfinancial cases as being establishment of a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d This does not\nrequire that every debt be paid, but that an applicant demonstrated a plan and took\nsignificant steps to implement the plan. All outstanding debts do not need to be\naddressed simultaneously. An applicant may provide for payment of debts one at a time.\nThere is no reason not to trust this applicant to do what she intends to do, or to in any\nway compromise national security. (ISCR Case No. 07-06482 App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting\nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and\ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or\novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for\naccess to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\n    Subparagraphs 1.a.-v.: For Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted. \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has not worked a second job since 2004, but he is now seeking part-time employment. \nApplicant married in 1989. He and his wife separated in 2001. For several years after his\nseparation, Applicant continued to pay the car insurance and car payment on his wife\u2019s car. He\nstopped making these payments in 2004. He has a 25 year-old son, who lives independently and has\nchronic illness. He regularly provides his son with money to pay for medicine.  \nFor several years prior to his father\u2019s death in 1994, Applicant regularly traveled about 150\nmiles away to help care for his father. He helped his father pay for medications and helped other\nfamily members with expenses. He used his credit cards to pay for these expenses. By 1998, his debt\noverwhelmed him. He enrolled in a credit management program. From 1998 through 2005, he paid\nthe program approximately $550 a month. Through this program, he resolved many of his\noutstanding debts.\n In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against him personally. The IRS\ncollected the moneys due through garnishment on his wages. From May 2003 until approximately\nNovember 2004, Applicant paid the IRS $1,166 twice a month for a total payment of more than\n$44,000.\nThe SOR lists numerous debts, which are listed at least once on each credit report and\nsometimes more than once because the debt is under other creditors\u2019 names.  The Judge said that\nafter reviewing the credit reports and the SOR, she compiled a list of the total debts owed, excluding\n\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s brief contains the following language \u201cWith the exception of the specific factual findings\n1\nchallenged on appeal, the Government adopts the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact for the purposes of this appeal\nand, in further support of its appeal arguments specifically relies on the following evidence[.]\u201d The brief does not clearly\ndelineate those instances where it is relying on a finding of fact made by the Judge and those instances where it is relying\non portions of the record that were not the source of a specific finding of fact on the part of the Judge.  Also, when\nchallenging the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, the brief is reasonably specific in one instance, but vague in another.\n3\nany duplicate entries. The Judge found that Applicant has one undisputed unpaid debt of $4,810 and\nfive other disputed debts cumulatively worth about $9,000.\nIn 2004, after he lost his second job, Applicant fell behind on his rent and other expenses\nbecause of the IRS garnishment.  At this time, he paid his wife\u2019s car payment and insurance as well\nas his own. His former landlord obtained a judgment for unpaid rent in 2005 and  he has not paid this\ndebt.  He contacted the creditor sometime ago, but has not resolved the debt because the creditor\ndemanded full payment and refused to accept a monthly payment.   Two debts listed in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c and 1.i are unknown to Applicant as he does not recognize the listed creditors. Applicant\u2019s\ncredible denial of knowledge of these two debts is sufficient to refute the allegations of delinquent\ndebts. The pertinent credit report did not have sufficient information for Applicant to locate the\naccount. Appellant denied owing a debt to the cable company listed in SOR allegation 1.n.  In the\npast, he received cable service from another cable company and two satellite companies. Although\nhe acknowledged at the hearing that he returned a cable box for his girlfriend who had service with\nthis cable company, he strongly denies any service in his name. Subsequent to the hearing, he filed\nan identity theft claim on this debt.  Applicant credibly denied owing the unpaid cell phone listed\nin allegation 1.j. He has had a cell phone with three other cell phone companies, but not this\ncompany. Several years ago, he asked this creditor to provide him with evidence that he owed them\nmoney. At that point, the creditor sent him a bill. Applicant currently earns $5,915 in gross income\neach month and $4,214 a month in net income. His monthly expenses total approximately $4,000\nand include rent, utilities, a car payment, gasoline, credit cards, food, and a time share. He uses his\nremaining income to help his son with medicine and occasionally other family members.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nTo the extent that Department Counsel\u2019s brief challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, such\nchallenges will be included in the discussion below.  \n1\n\nThe Board has previously noted in response to prior briefs with similar language that we have no authority to\nmake de novo findings of fact.  A party relying on a portion of the record assists themselves and the Board by indicating\nwhether the portion relied upon is the basis of a finding of fact made by the Judge, or is a portion of the record not\naddressed by the Judge\u2019s findings.  Similarly, a party challenging the Judge\u2019s findings assists themselves and the Board\nby stating with some precision which of the Judge\u2019s findings are being challenged.  Further clarification (of such\nchallenges) is obtained when the party states whether the Judge\u2019s finding of fact error is an error of commission (e.g.,\na finding that the light was red when the record indicates that it was green; a finding that Applicant had two DWI\nconvictions when the record indicates he had three) or an error of omission (a piece of record evidence important to the\nresolution of the case is not incorporated into a finding of fact or is otherwise not commented upon by the Judge).  See\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-1176 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-15485 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2005).\n[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n2\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted reasonably under the circumstances.\n[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n3\n4\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions:\n(1) The government failed to establish a prima facie case as to the debts identified in SOR\nallegations 1.c and 1.i because it has not provided evidence which identifies the creditor for these\ndebts. \n(2) Concerning the debt identified in SOR allegation 1.j, without evidence that Applicant\nsigned a contract to retain the services of the company in question, the mere mailing of a bill is not\nenough to show a contractual obligation which would give rise to the debt as a bill can be created\nsimply and easily.  SOR allegation 1.j is found in favor of Applicant.\n(3) Regarding mitigation, Adjudicative Guideline 20 (b),  applies since Applicant\u2019s initial\n2\nfinancial problems arose when his father became ill and he accumulated numerous credit card debts\nassociated with his father\u2019s care.  Applicant also separated from his wife. As part of an informal\nseparation agreement he continued to make her car payment and paid for her car insurance until he\nlost his second job.  \n(4) Adjudicative Guideline 20 (d)  applies as Applicant has resolved many of the delinquent\n3\ndebts listed in the SOR, either by payment or settlement.  Although an outstanding judgment is not\npaid, Applicant attempted to pay the debt through monthly payments, but the creditor refused.  He\ndid not ignore the debt.  His finances are sound and he acts responsibly in regard to his finances.  \n\n[T]he individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of he past-due debt which is the cause of the\n4\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue.\n5\n(5) Adjudicative Guideline 20 (e)  has some applicability as Applicant disputed the debt\n4\nlisted in SOR allegation 1.e as he believes this debt has been paid through an earlier payment plan.\nThe credit reporting agency has not responded to his notice of dispute nor resolved the conflict in\ninformation about this debt.\n(6) Under the whole person concept, Applicant has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve\nmost of the delinquent debts raising security concerns.  Even though he has had financial problems,\nhe has demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt repayment.  For four years, he managed his\nexpenses, including a substantial monthly payment to the IRS.  While some debts remain unpaid,\nthey are insufficient to raise security concerns, particularly since he has resolved the majority of his\ndebts.\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\n\n6\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s determination that the Government had not\nestablished a prima facie case as to allegations 1.c and 1.i was arbitrary and capricious because it was\ncontrary to the record evidence and contrary to precedent established by the Board.  Department\nCounsel notes that the Judge found that the debts alleged at these two SOR paragraphs remained\nunproven because \u201cthey were unknown to Applicant as he does not recognize the listed debts.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel alleges that the Judge\u2019s requirement that the Government provide greater detail\nthan was set forth on its credit reports improperly increased the Government\u2019s burden of proof\nregarding the two debts.  In the case of the two debts, neither the Judge nor the parties at the hearing\nseemed to know who the creditors were.  However, there is evidence in the record which identifies\nboth creditors with sufficient specificity that a reasonable applicant ought to able to respond to the\nallegation of delinquent indebtedness (See Credit Report dated August 12, 2008 in Government\nExhibit two with page numbers \u201c25 of 29\" and \u201c26 of 29\" at the tops of the pages and page numbers\n142 and 143 at the bottom of the pages).  It is of course, well-settled that adverse information from\na  credit report can normally meet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations\nunder E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App Bd. Oct. 26,\n2006).  In fact, the credit reports were detailed enough to establish the government\u2019s case regarding\nthe two allegations.\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge committed error by applying Adjudicative\nGuideline  20 (d) in mitigation and by stating that \u201cApplicant had resolved many of the delinquent\ndebts listed in the SOR, either by payment or settlement.\u201d  Specifically, Department Counsel alleges\nthat the Judge erroneously applied the mitigating condition with regard to debts alleged at SOR\nallegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i and 1.n.  Evaluation of this claim of error is hampered somewhat\nby the fact that, when discussing the applicability of this mitigating condition, the Judge specifically\nmentioned only the debts at 1.a and 1.b.  After a review of the record the Board concludes that,\nalthough the evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s diligence in dealing with the debt is mixed, the Judge\u2019s\napplication of the mitigating condition to the debt alleged at 1.a was not error.  However, the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis of the IRS garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages in allegation 1.b is not sustainable.  The Judge\ngives Applicant credit under the mitigating condition for initiation of payment of a debt.  On its face,\nsatisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the\nsame as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.  Regarding debts 1.c and\n1.i, since the Judge based her analysis on a finding that the Government had not initially established\nits case with regard to these debts, a further analysis under Adjudicative Guideline 20 (d) would not\nfollow logically.  However, on remand, given the Board\u2019s preceding ruling on these two allegations,\nanalysis under the mitigating condition may well be necessary.\nAlso, under Adjudicative Guideline 20 (d), Department Counsel complains that, regarding\nthe debts covered in allegations 1.f, 1.g, and 1.n, the Judge erred in applying the mitigating condition\nbecause the debts were not addressed by Applicant until his security clearance processing had\nproceeded through its entire investigation and a due process hearing, and therefore could not\nconstitute a \u201cgood faith effort to resolve debts.\u201d  On this record, the timing of Applicant\u2019s attempts\n\n7\nto resolve these particular debts does not make the mitigating condition inapplicable as a matter of\nlaw.  However, the timing of Applicant\u2019s actions impacts upon the degree to which the mitigating\nfactor applies.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument raises the issue of the Judge\u2019s failure to consider the\nfact that any efforts on the part of Applicant to resolve these debts came very late in the process.\nUnder these circumstances, the failure of the Judge to analyze the timing of Applicant\u2019s actions when\nconsidering the mitigating factor was error.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erroneously applied Adjudicative Guideline 20\n(e) in mitigation.  It should be mentioned at the outset that, despite the breadth of Department\nCounsel\u2019s argument, the Judge\u2019s decision appears to limit the application of this mitigating condition\nto a single debt (allegation 1.e).  Regarding that debt, the Judge\u2019s analysis is problematic in that it\nstates only vaguely that the mitigating condition has \u201csome\u201d applicability and it focuses on the\nreasonableness of Applicant\u2019s belief that the debt has been resolved while at the same time\nacknowledging that his belief may be erroneous.  The mitigating condition also requires documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or evidence of actions to resolve the issue, and the\nJudge\u2019s discussion of whether Applicant has satisfied these requirements is inadequate.\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge erred by applying Adjudicative Guideline 20 (b)\nto this case.  Department Counsel states that the record evidence fails to establish a nexus between\nconditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control and the various, ongoing financial delinquencies alleged in\nthe SOR, and contends that even if there is some connection, there is little evidence that Applicant\nacted reasonably under the circumstances.  After a review of the record evidence, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge\u2019s application of Adjudicative Guideline 20 (b) was not inappropriate as a\nmatter of law.  However, Department Counsel challenges the adequacy of the Judge\u2019s discussion of\nthis mitigation issue in her decision.  The record reveals that Applicant encountered serious financial\ndifficulties during the period of his father\u2019s illness and death, but that over a period of years, much\nof that delinquent indebtedness was resolved.  The record further indicates that a second round of\nfinancial difficulties followed the loss of a job in 2004.  The Judge\u2019s discussion lacks sufficient\ndetail in that she does not discuss individual debts and how the rise of those debts relate to either of\nthe two distinct periods in Applicant\u2019s past where he lost control of his finances.  The Judge also\nfails to explain the relevance of Applicant\u2019s voluntary entry into a separation agreement with his wife\nand the subsequent acceptance of her car payment and insurance obligations, given the fact that the\nmitigating condition covers circumstances largely beyond the debtor\u2019s control.\nThe Board remands the case to the Judge with instructions to re-open the record for the\nlimited purpose of obtaining from Applicant an admission or denial regarding the  two creditors\nreferred to in  SOR allegation 1.c and 1.i in light of the discussion above.  Department Counsel shall\nbe given an opportunity to respond.  The Judge shall write a new decision in which she evaluates the\nadditional information.  The new decision shall not give Applicant credit under Adjudicative\nGuideline 20 (d) for the IRS garnishment nor for any debt which Applicant disputes, denies or\notherwise has not paid.  The new decision shall discuss the significance of the timing of each of\nApplicant\u2019s actions on his debts which were taken in the aftermath of the initiation of security\nclearance due process. The Judge\u2019s new decision shall include in any discussion of either\nAdjudicative Guideline 20 (b) or Adjudicative Guideline 20 (e) a complete discussion as to how each\n\n8\nprong of the Adjudicative Guideline applies for each debt under discussion in light of the Judge\u2019s\nown findings of fact and the record evidence.  The Judge\u2019s new decision shall not contain a\ndiscussion of her appraisal of the Board\u2019s authority (See ISCR Case No. 07-15281 at fn. 5 (App. Bd.\nJun. 16, 2009). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED in accordance with the\ndecision above.\nSigned: Michael Y.

She noted that Applicant had experienced\nfamily illnesses, loss of employment, and a separation from his wife. We summarized the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact thoroughly in our prior decision, ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009).\n  \nA. Whether the Judge Exceeded the Scope of the Remand Order\nIn her original decision, the Judge concluded that the record was not sufficient to enable\nApplicant to identify two of the creditors alleged in the SOR.  Having found evidence in the record\nsufficient to identify them, we remanded the case to the Judge for the purpose of obtaining from\nApplicant an admission or a denial regarding the debts alleged to be owed these two creditors.  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge did not comply with the requirements of the\nremand order, insofar as the Judge reopened the record and solicited new evidence.  We find\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.\nThe Appeal Board has authority to remand a case to a Judge for the correction of errors.  \u201cIf\nthe case is remanded, the Appeal Board shall specify the action to be taken on remand[.]\u201d Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.33.2.  The case will then be assigned to a Judge \u201cfor correction of errors(s) in accordance with\nthe Appeal Board\u2019s clearance decision.  The assigned Administrative Judge shall make a new\nclearance decision in the case after correcting the error(s) identified by the Appeal Board.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6\nE3.1.35.  In this case, the Judge exceeded the scope of the remand order by receiving new evidence.\nThis new evidence concerned an additional debt other than the two which the Judge had found to\nbe unidentifiable.  It appears to have been generated after the close of the record.  Furthermore,\nApplicant made no reply at all concerning one of the two debts at issue in our decision. The Judge\u2019s\nadmission of new evidence was error, as was her failure to secure an admission or denial concerning\none of the two debts, as the remand order required.\nB.  Whether the Judge\u2019s Decision is Arbitrary, Capricious, or Contrary to Law\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\nSee Decision at Note 7: \u201cApplicant believed this account had been paid in his payment plan developed in 1998,\n1\nbut the account number is different . . . The credit reports show conflicting information on the status of this debt . . . ,\nincluding paid, a zero balance and transferred or sold.\u201d  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, the Board will review\nthe Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nThe record demonstrates that Applicant had paid off certain of his debts.  However, the\nrecord also contains gaps and ambiguities that undercut Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation and the\nJudge\u2019s favorable decision.  For example, the Judge gave Applicant credit for attempting to resolve\na $4,810 judgement owed to a former landlord.  She stated that \u201cthe judgment, is not resolved or\nbeing resolved because the creditor is uncooperative, not for lack of effort on Applicant\u2019s part.\u201d\nDecision at 12.  The record demonstrates that Applicant had encountered financial problems and\nsought a reduction in the rent he owed the landlord.  The landlord did not agree to accept a reduced\nrent and eventually had Applicant evicted.  The landlord received a judgment against Applicant for\nunpaid rent.  Applicant did not appear at the court hearing.  Applicant stated that he had contacted\nthe landlord\u2019s attorney, who acted \u201ckind of indignant\u201d toward him.  Tr. at 28.  There is no evidence\nto corroborate any efforts Applicant has made to satisfy this judgment or otherwise attempt to\naddress it in good faith.  Neither is there anything in the record to support the Judge\u2019s opinion that\nthe landlord behaved unreasonably in seeking monies owed under the lease.  The record does not\nsupport a conclusion that Applicant has demonstrated mitigation regarding this debt.\nThe Judge found that another debt, in the amount of $4,660 for a credit card, had been paid.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s claim that he had satisfied this debt through a repayment plan is not supported\nby Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which lists payments to various creditors pursuant to the plan.  This\ndebt does not appear in AE A, which is not consistent with Applicant\u2019s contention that he had paid\nthe debt off during the course of the repayment plan.  Furthermore, the Judge herself acknowledged\nthat the record evidence is inconsistent concerning this debt.   The record is not sufficient to\n1\ndemonstrate that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation under the Egan\nstandard regarding this debt.  The SOR also alleged a debt of $5,699 owed to a jeweler.  While the\nrecord contains a settlement offer to Applicant by the creditor, it does not demonstrate that Applicant\nactually paid the amount contained in the offer.  Exhibit H.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\nhad paid off this debt through settlement is not supported by the record evidence.  \nOf particular note is the $1,377 debt which formed part of the basis for the remand order.\nIn the original decision the Judge concluded that the evidence did not identify either this creditor,\nSOR \u00b6 1(c), or another alleged in SOR \u00b6 1(i) and that, as a consequence, the Government had failed\nto meet its burden of production.  However, as we stated in our earlier decision, the record did indeed\nidentify both creditors with sufficient specificity to enable Applicant to address the debts.\nFurthermore, AE L, provided by Applicant in response to the remand order, specifically identified\n\nAE E consists of two pay stubs from a previous employer, one showing a \u201cGarnishment-Tax Levy\u201d in the\n2\namount of $5,036.95 and the other showing $7,717.60.  AE F is an employee earnings report from a different employer,\ncovering the period of time between May 2003 and November 2004.  This document shows a total of $44,008.46 paid\nby garnishment to an unspecified creditor.  Government Exhibit 2, Response to Interrogatories, contains a credit report,\ndated August 12, 2008, which lists the federal tax lien.  It does not report a \u201creleased date\u201d for the lien.  The record does\nnot contain a document from the IRS to Applicant stating that the tax debt had been satisfied.  \nthe creditor alleged in 1(c) and provided some information concerning the debt.  Nevertheless, in her\nDecision on Remand, the Judge continued to assert that the identities of both creditors were\nunknown, although she concluded that Applicant had demonstrated that 1(c) had been resolved.  The\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that these creditors could not be identified is error, as is her conclusion that the\nevidence is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from them, in light of the Egan\nstandard.   \nWe also note the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant had three debts which he denied but which\nhe subsequently paid after the hearing.  \u201cHis change in position is not explained.\u201d  Decision at 6-7.\nThis lack of explanation undercuts her subsequent analysis that Applicant had demonstrated a good-\nfaith effort to resolve these debts.  The Judge does not address why Applicant could not reasonably\nhave ascertained the validity of the debts prior to the hearing or, indeed, prior to his receipt of the\nSOR.  Moreover, the fact that Applicant\u2019s largest debt, the $24,701 tax lien, was paid off through\ngarnishment rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.   All in all, considering\n2\nthe record as a whole, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from his financial problems.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is\nnot sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA\u2019ANAN\n\nISCR Case No. 98-0066 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 1999).\n3\nAppeals after remand where harmful error is at issue can put the Board in a quandary.  At\nsome point the case needs to reach closure.  On the other hand, sometimes preservation of the\nprocess  and its integrity is paramount.  The proper resolution of this case is remand to another\nJudge.  In order to demonstrate why that is appropriate, it is necessary to discuss how the Judge\nimplemented the Board\u2019s instructions from the first Appeal Board case:\nIn the case at issue now, the Judge received specific instructions from the Board.  Indeed,\nthere were, effectively, nine instructions.  The Judge carried out four of them.  The Judge re-opened\nthe record.   The Judge gave Department Counsel an opportunity to respond.  The Judge issued a new\ndecision.  The Judge gave Applicant no credit under Directive Enclosure 2\u00b6 20(d) for the IRS\ngarnishment nor any debt which he disputed, denied or had not paid.\n  The Judge partly carried out two instructions. The Judge did have a discussion of the timing\nof certain payments but it was not sensible\u2013the Judge concluded that payment of two debts after the\nhearing was indicative of good faith.  The Judge did remove her expansive  inappropriate discussion\nof the Appeal Board\u2019s authority but she added in new, and factually incorrect, arguments with the\nBoard regarding the two debts which were a substantial basis for the remand.\n The Judge failed entirely to implement three instructions.  The record was only to be opened\nfor the \u201climited purpose of obtaining from Applicant an admission or denial regarding the two\ncreditors referred to in SOR allegation 1.c and 1.i . . .\u201d  The Judge directed Applicant to take various\nactions with multiple third parties and then to submit new evidence to her.  Those directions\nexceeded the scope of the remand order.  The Judge did not explain what authority she had for such\ndirections.  Next, the Judge was supposed to evaluate Applicant\u2019s admissions or denials on two debts\nwhich she had mistakenly believed were not identified in the record.  After remand,  Applicant\ndiscussed the status of his relationship with the creditor in 1.c, a national retailer, through two\naccounts.  The Judge failed to discuss or evaluate Applicant\u2019s explicit acknowledgment of the\nidentity of the creditor.  The Judge also failed to note the Board\u2019s identification of the pages in the\nrecord where the creditor\u2019s name and contact information were identified.  Instead of evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment, the Judge wrote, \u201cApplicant also disputed the debt in allegation 1.c\nafter the hearing.  He continually denied any knowledge of the creditor.  The credit report failed to\nidentify the original creditor, and did not list an address or telephone number for this creditor.  Thus,\nApplicant had no way to contact the creditor or pay the debt if it was his.  Given that the Appeal\nBoard considered the debt proven, Applicant properly disputed after remand under these facts.\u201d\n(Decision p. 10.)  Finally, any discussion in the new decision of Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 20 (b) or\n20 (e) was supposed to have a complete discussion as to how each prong of the guideline applies for\neach debt under discussion.  The Judge failed to do that.\nIn light of the Judge\u2019s failures and her continued argumentation it is not plausible to believe\nshe could render a fair and reasoned decision in this case.  There is case law both within DOHA  and\n3\n\nSee e.g., United States v. Robin 553 F.2d 8 (2  cir.), United States v. Torkington  874 F.2d 1441(11th Cir.),\n4\nnd\nChudasma v. Mazda 123 F.3rd 1353 (11  Cir.).\nth\noutside of DOHA  for the proposition that when a Judge is unwilling to carry out the law in a given\n4\ncase that the proper resolution is to remand the case to another Judge even absent a showing of bias.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F\nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 16, 2008.

Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 12, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 12, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on February 17, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 23,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 24, 2009. The government\noffered five exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit any exhibits. I,\nhowever, held the record open for 30 days for Applicant to submit additional evidence.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 31, 2009. On April 24, 2009,\nApplicant timely submitted nine exhibits, AE A through AE I, without objection. These\nexhibits have been marked and admitted into the record. The record closed on April 24,\n2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice on March 6,\n2009, which is more than 15 days prior to the hearing date as required under \u00b6 E3.1.8\nof the Directive.

He recently attended a bartender school and is certified as a\nbartender. He worked a second full-time job from 2000 until 2004, when his employer\nlaid him off. As a result of the lay off, his income decreased from $108,000 a year to\napproximately $60,000 a year. He has not worked a second job since 2004, but he is\nnow seeking part-time employment as a bartender.3\nApplicant married in 1989. He and his wife separated in 2001, but have not\ndivorced. For several years after his separation, Applicant continued to pay the car\ninsurance and car payment on his wife\u2019s car. He stopped making these payments when\nhe lost his second job in 2004. He has a 25 year-old son, who lives independently and is\na diabetic. He regularly provides his son with money to pay for insulin, as his son is\noften short on cash.4\nApplicant\u2019s father died in 1994. For several years prior to his father\u2019s death,\nApplicant regularly travel between his home and his father\u2019s home, about 150 miles\naway, to help care for his father. He also helped his father pay for medications and has\nhelped other family members with expenses. He used his credit cards to pay for these\nexpenses. By 1998, his debt overwhelmed him. He enrolled in a credit management\nprogram. From October 1998 through August 2005, he paid approximately $550 a\nmonth to this company, which then paid his creditors. Through this program, he\nresolved many of his outstanding debts.5\nIn 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against him\npersonally. IRS collected the moneys due through a bi-monthly garnishment on his\nwages. From May 2003 until approximately November 2004, Applicant paid the IRS\n$1,166 twice a month for a total payment of more than $44,000.6\nThe SOR lists numerous debts, which are listed at least once on each credit\nreport and sometimes more than once because the debt is under other creditor\u2019s\nnames. After reviewing the credit reports dated November 4, 2004, May 25, 2006,\nAugust 12, 2008, October 16, 2008,  and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total\n\nGE 2 (Applicant\u2019s response to Interrogatories, including credit report, dated August 12, 2008); GE 3 (Credit\n7\nreport, dated October 16, 2008); GE 4 (Credit report, dated May 25, 2006); GE 5 (Credit report, dated\nNovember 4, 2004).\nApplicant believed this account had been paid in his payment plan developed in 1998, but the account\n8\nnumber is different.

Instead, Applicant provided AE I, which disputes the debt.\nTr. 57-60, 103-105.\n13\nGE 2, supra note 7, at 4, 35-37; AE D; Tr. 118-136.\n14\n5\nIn 2004, after he lost his second job, Appellant fell behind in paying his apartment\nrent and other expenses because of the IRS garnishment.  At this time, he paid not only\n9\nhis car payment and insurance, but also the car payment and insurance for his wife for\na total of $1,300 a month (which he no longer pays). He acknowledges that his former\nlandlord obtained a judgment for unpaid rent in 2005 and that he has not paid this debt.\nHe contacted this creditor sometime ago, but has not resolved the debt as the creditor\ndemanded full payment and refused to accept a monthly payment.10\nTwo debts listed in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.i are unknown to Applicant as he does\nnot recognize the listed creditor. Applicant\u2019s credible denial of knowledge of these two\ndebts is sufficient to refute the allegations of delinquent debts. The pertinent credit\nreport did not have sufficient information for Applicant to locate the account.  \n11\nAppellant denied owing a debt to the cable company listed in SOR allegation 1.n.\nIn the past, he received cable service from another cable company and two satellite\ncompanies. Although he acknowledged at the hearing that he returned a cable box for\nhis girlfriend who had service with this cable company, he strongly denies any service in\nhis name. Subsequent to the hearing, he filed an identity theft claim on this debt.   \n12\nApplicant also credibly denied owing the unpaid cell phone listed in allegation 1.j.\nHe previously had a cell phone with three other cell phone companies, but not this\ncompany. Several years ago, he asked this creditor to provide him with evidence that he\nowed them money. At that point, the creditor sent him a bill.13\nApplicant currently earns $5,915 in gross income each month and $4,214 a\nmonth in net income. His monthly expenses total approximately $4,000 and include\nrent, utilities, a car payment, gasoline, credit cards, food, and a time share. He uses his\nremaining income to help his son with medicine and occasionally other family\nmembers.  \n14\nApplicant completed his SF 86 on August 25, 2004. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing questions:\nQuestion 36 Your Financial Record- Tax Lien\n\nTr.  67-69, 115-116.\n15\n6\nIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for\nfailing to pay taxes or other debts?\nQuestion 38. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 days\nIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\nQuestion 39: Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 days\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\nApplicant denies that he intentionally falsified these answers. He answered \u201cno\u201d\nto the tax lien question because he did not own property and because he paid the tax\nlien through a wage garnishment, which he listed when he completed his SF 86. At the\ntime he completed his SF 86, he did not believe he had any debts more than 180 days\ndelinquent and his current bills were not 90 days overdue. He completed the SF 86 on\nhis computer in May or June 2004 and forwarded it to his office for review. The office\nreturned it to him in paper form in August 2004 for signature.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n16\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE3.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommending remand of cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)(explaining standard\nof review).\n7\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n16\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n8\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, including federal tax debt,\nand a judgment for unpaid debt, which he was unable to pay for a period of time. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination. \nThe government has not established a prima facie case as to the debts identified\nin SOR allegations 1.c and 1.i. because the government has not provided evidence\nwhich shows the creditor for these debts. The government has not plead these\nallegations with enough specificity to give Applicant notice as to whom he owes these\ndebts. Concerning the telephone debt identified in SOR allegation 1.j., without evidence\nthat Applicant signed a contract to retain the services of this company, I find that the\nmere mailing of a bill is not enough to show a contractual obligation which would give\nrise to the debt as a bill can be created simply and easily. SOR allegation 1.j is found in\nfavor of Applicant.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n9\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ While some of\nhis debts occurred some time ago, he did not present evidence which shows that his\ndebts occurred under unusual circumstances which are not likely to reoccur in the\nfuture. This mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s initial\nfinancial problems arose when his father became ill. He not only traveled frequently, a\nround trip distance of approximately 300 miles to care for his father, he also provided\nfinancial help to assist in his father\u2019s care. He paid for many of these costs with credit\ncards. By 1998, his debt overwhelmed him and he sought consumer credit counseling.\nHe also obtained a second full-time job in 2000 to help pay his expenses. He and his\nwife separated in 2001. As part of their informal separation agreement, he continued to\npay her car payment and car insurance until he lost his second job in 2004. I find this\nmitigating condition applies as he acted reasonably under past circumstances and\nshows he acted responsibly then and has since. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). As discussed above, Applicant became\noverwhelmed with his debts in 1998 and retained a credit counseling agency to help him\nresolve his debt issues. He developed a payment plan with this agency and complied\nwith the terms of the plan. He paid his debts in full by 2005. Given that the debts listed\nin the SOR are not included in this debt repayment plan, this mitigating condition does\nnot apply.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has\nresolved many of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, either by payment or\nsettlement. He completely paid his federal tax debt in 2004 through garnishment of his\nwages. He has also resolved many of the debts listed in the SOR. Although the\njudgment is not paid, he attempted to pay the debt through monthly payments, which\nthe creditor refused. The creditor\u2019s unwillingness to accept monthly payments is not\nApplicant\u2019s fault and impedes his ability to resolve this debt. He did not ignore the debt.\nHe denies the two remaining unpaid debts, which total approximately $1,600. These two\nunpaid debts and the unpaid judgment constitute about 15% of the debts alleged in the\nSOR. His finances are sound and he acts responsibly in regards to his finances. I\nconclude this mitigating condition applies.\nFinally, an Applicant may mitigated security concerns under AG \u00b6 20 (e) if \u201cthe\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 07-08925 (App. Bd. Sept. 15, 2008); ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17,\n17\n2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputed the\ndebt listed in SOR allegation 1.e as believes this debt had been paid through his earlier\npayment plan. While the evidence indicates his belief may not be true, his decision to\ndispute this debt is reasonable based on his knowledge of the debts included in his\nconsolidation plan. The credit reporting agency has not responded to his notice of\ndispute nor resolved the conflict in information about this debt. This mitigating condition\nhas some applicability to this one debt.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s falsification must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 36, 38 and 39 about his past due debts and tax lien. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. In his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent\nto hide information about his finances. When a falsification allegation is controverted,\nthe government has the burden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an\nomission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record\nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nconcerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.17\nApplicant denied intentionally leaving out information about his overdue debts\nand tax lien. Because he did not own property, the IRS filed its tax lien against him\npersonally, then garnished his wages for payment. He disclosed the garnishment on his\n\nTr. 145.\n18\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n19\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n11\nSF 86. In light of this information, the government acknowledged he did not falsify his\nanswer to the Question 36.  Applicant\u2019s finances began to deteriorate around the time\n18\nhe completed his SF-86 because he lost his second job. At the time, he completed his\nSF-86, none of his current debts were more than 90 days past due. He did not falsify his\nanswer to Question 39.  Concerning his \u201cno\u201d answer to Question 38, Applicant\u2019s failure\nto answer \u201cyes\u201d about his past debts is not proof that he intentionally falsified his SF 86.\nThe government has not established that Applicant intended to hide his financial\nsituation from the government. Applicant had paid and continued to pay outstanding\ndebts under his debt consolidation payment plan. Thus, he did not believe these debts\nwere past due. His belief, although mistaken, does not reflect intentional conduct on his\npart. His testimony reflects that he sought to provide honest and correct information. He\nprovided other negative information in his SF 86 about the IRS garnishment of his\nwages, which supports his position that he did not act intentionally. Guideline E is found\nin favor of Applicant.19\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\n\n12\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant \u2018s\nfinancial problems began about 15 years ago and continued until very recently. His\nfinancial problems are the result, in part, of poor choices made about spending money.\nEven though his financial problems began many years ago, the mitigating evidence\nunder the whole person concept is more substantial. Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nbegan when his father became ill. Recognizing his responsibility as a son, he traveled,\nat his own expense, to his father\u2019s home and cared for him. He also provided financial\nassistance to his father for medication and other necessary expenses. For four years\nafter his father died, he unsuccessfully attempted to pay his debts. In 1998, he sought\nand received financial counseling through debt consolidation. For the next seven years,\nhe routinely paid the counseling service, when then paid his creditors until the bills were\npaid. His decision to seek help with his finances and his compliance with the program\nshows that he not only acted in a responsible manner, but that he is willing to accept\nresponsibility for his debts. He also worked two jobs full-time in an effort to pay his\ndebts, certain expenses for his estranged wife, and his living expenses. For four years,\nhe managed his expenses, including a substantial monthly payment to the IRS. Through\nthese efforts, he resolved much of his debt. His financial problems began anew when he\nlost one of his full-time jobs in 2004. Over the last five years, he has worked slowly to\nresolve his new financial issues. His one major unpaid debt is not resolved or being\nresolved because the creditor is uncooperative, not for lack of effort on Applicant\u2019s part.\nBecause of his long history of debt resolution, his statement that he tried to resolve the\njudgment debt is credible.\n \nApplicant has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent\ndebts raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) He has not paid two small debts\nlisted in the SOR because these debts are not his. He is taking action on one of these\ndebts. Even though he has had financial problems, he has demonstrated a meaningful\ntrack record of debt repayment.  He is not required to be debt free to hold a security\nclearance. Rather, he must manages his finances and live within his financial means.\nThe issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While some\ndebts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise security concerns, particularly since\nhe has resolved the majority of his debts. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\n\nIn many decisions, the Appeal Board has presumed that an administrative judge considered all the evidence\n20\nof record unless the Judge specifically states otherwise. ISCR Case No. 01-19879 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2002)\nand ISCR Case No. 01-10301 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 2002).\n13\nconsiderations. In reaching this conclusion, I have considered all the evidence of record\neven if not specifically discussed.20\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Based on a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and remand order, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 25,\n2004. On December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F\nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nMay 13, 2010\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application); Tr. 23, 70, 73-74.\n1\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 16, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on January 10, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 12, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 12, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on February 17, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 23,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 24, 2009. The government\noffered five exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit any exhibits. I,\nhowever, held the record open for 30 days for Applicant to submit additional evidence.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 31, 2009. On April 24, 2009,\nApplicant timely submitted nine exhibits, AE A through AE I, without objection. These\nexhibits have been marked and admitted into the record. The record closed on April 24,\n2009.\nDOHA issued my decision on May 29, 2009. Department Counsel appealed,\nalleging error in my findings regarding SOR allegations 1.c and 1.i and under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20\n(b), (d), and (e). The Appeal Board remanded this case for further findings.\nIn compliance with the decision of the Appeal Board, I issued an order on\nNovember 10, 2009, reopening the record. The order instructed Applicant to obtain\ncertain information. Applicant received the order on January 14, 2010, because his\naddress had changed and his mail was not timely forwarded. Applicant immediately\ncontacted DOHA. After a telephone conference with Applicant and Department\nCounsel, Applicant\u2019s request for an extension of time to comply with the order was\ngranted. On January 19, 2010, an order was issued holding the record open until March\n11, 2010 for Applicant to comply with the original order and giving the Government 30\ndays to respond. The Government submitted its response on April 15, 2010, which was\nreceived on April 16, 2010. Applicant submitted three additional exhibits, AE J through\nAE L, which are admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works for a Department of State contractor as a\nSenior Production Control Technician in the Data Processing Center. He has worked in\nhis Department of State contractor job since 1989, with the exception of one year\nbetween 1994 and 1995 and two months in late 1997 and early 1998. He holds a top\nsecret clearance. 1\nApplicant graduated from high school, then attended a technical school for data\nprocessing training. He recently attended a bartender school and is certified as a\nbartender. He worked a second full-time job from 2000 until 2004, when his employer\nlaid him off. As a result of the lay off, his income decreased from $108,000 a year to\n\nTr. 75, 79-80, 84-85.\n2\nGE 1, supra note 2; Tr. 25, 70-72, 85-86, 89.\n3\nAE A; Tr. 96-98, 117.\n4\nAE E (Leave and earnings statement showing garnishment); AE F (Leave and earnings statements showing\n5\ngarnishment), total at 21; Tr. 29-31, 67-68.\nGE 2 (Applicant\u2019s response to Interrogatories, including credit report, dated August 12, 2008); GE 3 (Credit\n6\nreport, dated October 16, 2008); GE 4 (Credit report, dated May 25, 2006); GE 5 (Credit report, dated\nNovember 4, 2004).\n3\napproximately $60,000 a year. He has not worked a second job since 2004, but he is\nnow seeking part-time employment as a bartender.2\nApplicant married in 1989. He and his wife separated in 2001, but have not\ndivorced. For several years after his separation, Applicant continued to pay the car\ninsurance and car payment on his wife\u2019s car. He stopped making these payments when\nhe lost his second job in 2004. He has a 25 year-old son, who lives independently and is\na diabetic. He regularly provides his son with money to pay for insulin, as his son is\noften short on cash.3\nApplicant\u2019s father died in 1994. For several years prior to his father\u2019s death,\nApplicant regularly traveled between his home and his father\u2019s home, about 150 miles\naway, to help care for his father. He also helped his father pay for medications and has\nhelped other family members with expenses. He used his credit cards to pay for these\nexpenses. By 1998, his debt overwhelmed him. He enrolled in a credit management\nprogram. From October 1998 through August 2005, he paid approximately $550 a\nmonth to this company, which then paid his creditors. Through this program, he\nresolved many of his outstanding debts.4\nIn 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against him\npersonally. IRS collected the moneys due through a bi-monthly garnishment on his\nwages. From May 2003 until approximately November 2004, Applicant paid the IRS\n$1,166 twice a month for a total payment of more than $44,000.5\nThe SOR lists numerous debts, which are listed at least once on each credit\nreport and sometimes more than once because the debt is under other creditor\u2019s\nnames. After reviewing the credit reports dated November 4, 2004, May 25, 2006,\nAugust 12, 2008, October 16, 2008,  and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total\ndebts owed, excluding any duplicate entries. I find that Appellant\u2019s actual debts are as\nfollows:6\n\nApplicant believed this account had been paid in his payment plan developed in 1998, but the account\n7\nnumber is different.  See AE A. The credit reports show conflicting information on the status of this debt (all\nthe same account number), including paid, a zero balance and transferred or sold.  See GE 2, supra note 7,\nat 11; GE 3, supra note 7, at 3; GE 4, supra note 7; GE 5, supra note 7.\nAppellant skipped his car payment one month and the creditor repossessed his car. He immediately made\n8\nthe payment and regained possession of his car.

He acknowledges that his former\n\nTr. 26-29, 84-88.\n9\nSee generally ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).\n10\nTr. 63-67, 106-109. At the conclusion of the hearing, I requested Applicant obtain a statement from this\n11\ncreditor showing he did not owe any debt. Tr. 156. Instead, Applicant provided AE I, which disputes the debt.\nTr. 57-60, 103-105.\n12\nGE 2, supra note 7, at 4, 35-37; AE D; Tr. 118-136.\n13\n5\nlandlord obtained a judgment for unpaid rent in 2005 and that he has not paid this debt.\nHe contacted this creditor sometime ago, but has not resolved the debt as the creditor\ndemanded full payment and refused to accept a monthly payment.9\nTwo debts listed in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.i are unknown to Applicant as he does\nnot recognize the listed creditor. Applicant\u2019s credible denial of knowledge of these two\ndebts is sufficient to refute the allegations of delinquent debts. The pertinent credit\nreport did not have sufficient information for Applicant to locate the account.  \n10\nAppellant denied owing a debt to the cable company listed in SOR allegation 1.n.\nIn the past, he received cable service from another cable company and two satellite\ncompanies. Although he acknowledged at the hearing that he returned a cable box for\nhis girlfriend who had service with this cable company, he strongly denies any service in\nhis name. Subsequent to the hearing, he filed an identity theft claim on this debt.   \n11\nApplicant also credibly denied owing the unpaid cell phone listed in allegation 1.j.\nHe previously had a cell phone with three other cell phone companies, but not this\ncompany. Several years ago, he asked this creditor to provide him with evidence that he\nowed them money. At that point, the creditor sent him a bill.12\nApplicant currently earns $5,915 in gross income each month and $4,214 a\nmonth in net income. His monthly expenses total approximately $4,000 and include\nrent, utilities, a car payment, gasoline, credit cards, food, and a time share. He uses his\nremaining income to help his son with medicine and occasionally other family\nmembers.  \n13\nI make the following additional findings of fact. With the exception of the\njudgment in SOR allegation 1.a, Applicant denied owing all the debts listed in the SOR.\nAt the hearing, each debt was discussed. Through this discussion, the status of some\ndebts was determined. Applicant again denied any knowledge of the creditor in SOR\nallegation 1.c. (Creditor C). Creditor C first appeared on the credit report dated August\n12, 2008 and again on the October 16, 2008 credit report. Creditor C is a credit\ncollection company, not the original creditor. The original creditor is unknown. The\nAugust 12, 2008 credit report indicated that Applicant became delinquent on this\naccount in March 2008. This credit report also had an extensive list of creditors with the\nrelevant contact addresses and telephone numbers, but it did not have any information\n\nGE 2; AE K; Tr. 31-40. \n14\nGE 2; GE 4; GE 5; AE A; AE J; AE K..\n15\n6\nregarding Creditor C. The Government agreed that neither credit report provided an\naddress or telephone number for Creditor C, leaving Applicant without any means to\nobtain information from Creditor C about this debt and to pay the debt, if his. (Tr. 37-39).\nApplicant challenged this debt with one of the credit reporting companies, following the\nremand decision of the Appeal Board. Creditor C is not listed on Applicant\u2019s latest credit\nreport, dated February 13, 2010, which is from a company which previously listed the\nCreditor C debt. Since the debt became delinquent in March 2008, the credit reporting\ncompany did not remove Creditor C because the information was stale. Under these\nfacts, I find that the debt owed Creditor C has been removed as a result of his\nchallenge.14\nApplicant disputed the debt in SOR allegation 1.e (Creditor E-$4,660) sometime\nprior to the issuance of the SOR, as shown on the August 12, 2008 credit report.\nApplicant continued to dispute this debt. He filed a second dispute with the credit\nreporting agency and a dispute directly with Creditor E, the collection agency. The\ninformation provided to Applicant by Creditor E, after receiving his dispute, indicated\nthat the debt is a personal loan Applicant obtained from Bank A in March 2001. The\nNovember 4, 2004 credit report shows a personal loan with Bank B that was being\nmanaged by a financial counseling service, and a credit card with Bank A that was\neither closed or past due or with no balance. The May 25, 2006 credit report reflects\nthat the personal loan debt with Bank B was closed/paid and had a zero balance, and\nthat the credit card debt with Bank A had been sold to Bank B. Creditor E, the current\ncreditor, purchased one debt in April 2006 from Bank B. The August 12, 2008 credit\nreport showed that one of the Bank B accounts (not specified) was paid, transferred, or\nderogatory. Based on information from the credit reports, I find that the Creditor E debt\nis the credit card debt that originated at Bank A, then transferred to Bank B, and later\nsold to Creditor E, which now holds the debt. \nApplicant provided a history of his debt repayment program from October 1998\nthrough February 2005. This record showed two separate accounts with Bank B and\nthree different account numbers for Bank B. The personal loan account number is listed\nfor this program. The remaining two account numbers do not match the account\nnumbers listed on the May 25, 2006 and August 12, 2008 credit reports for Bank B.\nHowever, the credit reports going back to November 2004 do not show more than two\naccounts with Bank B and Bank A. After reviewing all the information of record, I find\nthat the credit card account that originated at Bank A, then transferred to Bank B, and\nlater sold to Creditor E, which now holds the debt was included in the debt repayment\nprogram.15\nAt the hearing, Applicant did not deny he had accounts with the creditors listed in\nSOR allegations 1.d, 1g, and 1.l. He denied owing these creditors any money, as he\nbelieved the debts had been paid. After the hearing, he paid the debts. His change in\n\nApplicant testified to having several satellite accounts.\n16\nResponse to SOR; AE B; AE G; Tr. 49-50, 64-67.\n17\nAE K.\n18\nGE 5; AE A; AE E; AE F.\n19\nGE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; AE K.\n20\n7\nposition is not explained. Concerning the debts in SOR allegations 1.f and 1.h, which\nare the same debt, Applicant testified that a settlement offer had been made.\nSubsequent to the hearing, the creditor accepted his offer and he paid the debt.\nApplicant consistently denied owing the debt in SOR allegation 1.n, stating that his\ncable account had been paid.  Following the hearing and after further discussion with\n16\nDepartment Counsel and investigation, Applicant decided to file an identity theft report\non this debt. This debt is now disputed. He did not file a similar report on any other\ndebt.  \n17\nApplicant denied the debt in SOR allegation 1.i because he did not recognize the\ncreditor. This debt is currently owned by a credit collection agency, which listed as the\noriginal creditor, a creditor unknown to Applicant. Applicant has not resolved or disputed\nthis debt.18\nThe debts in SOR allegations 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n\nare listed on the November 2004 credit report. Applicant paid 1.b by late 2004 through\ngarnishment. He also paid 1.e, 1.k, and 1.m under his payment plan.19\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect many \u201cpaid as agreed\u201d accounts over many\nyears and many paid collection accounts. Since November 2004, his credit reports\nshow an improvement in his financial situation. His 2008 and 2010 credit reports\nindicate that he pays his bills in a timely manner, and that he has few old unpaid\ndebts.20\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n8\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n9\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. In compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s decision, I find\nthat the Government established its case on all allegations in the SOR. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose\nin the mid-1990s and continue. His financial problems did not occur long ago or under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. This mitigating condition does not\napply.. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems began in the mid-1990s when he father became ill. Applicant provided his\nfather with money to buy medications and regularly traveled several hundred miles to\nhelp care for his father for a number of years. By 1998, Applicant realized that he could\nnot pay his bills and sought help with a financial counseling company. For seven years,\nhe paid this company monthly and it resolved a number of his bills, including the debts\nin SOR allegations 1.e, 1.k, and 1.m. Applicant also began working a second job in\n2000. In 2001, Applicant and his wife separated. He assumed certain financial\nresponsibilities from their marriage until 2004, when his second job ended. Between\n2000 and 2004, Applicant paid his financial obligations by working two jobs. He had\nsufficient income to pay two obligations from his marriage. When he lost his second job,\nhe decided he could not afford to pay his estranged wife\u2019s bills and stopped. Applicant\nacted reasonably in 1998 by working with a credit counseling company and through\n2005 by working a second job to pay his living expenses, garnishment, and debt\npayment plan. This mitigating condition applies SOR allegations 1.b, 1.e, 1.k, and 1.m. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received credit counseling\nrecently, but did receive credit counseling when he worked with the credit counseling\ncompany. He resolved three SOR debts through his counseling plan. Through the\ngarnishment of his wages, his federal tax lien was paid by 2004. Applicant\u2019s current\n\nAlthough Applicant has disputed this debt with Creditor E, I found that the debt was paid through his earlier\n21\ndebt repayment plan.\n10\nfinances are under control and his current bills are paid. This mitigating condition\napplies to SOR allegations 1.b, 1.e, 1.k, and 1.m.21\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ncontacted the creditor and paid the debts he owed in SOR allegations 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h,\nand 1.l. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that a settlement offer had been made to the\ncreditor in SOR allegations 1.f and 1.h, which are the same debt. After the hearing, the\ncreditor accepted his offer and Applicant quickly settled and paid the debt. Negotiations\nare a back-and-forth process until the parties reach an agreement. The process takes\ntime to reach a conclusion and Applicant successfully resolved this debt by working\nthrough the process. As for the bill with the jeweler (SOR allegations 1.g and 1.l),\nApplicant initially believed that he did not owe any money on this debt as he had\nreceived refund payments from the creditor in the past. Following the hearing, he\ninvestigated the debt and learned that he did owe additional money to the creditor. He\npaid his debt upon learning this information. Even though Applicant paid both debts\nafter the hearing, he had developed a working relationship with the one creditor prior to\nthe hearing and paid the second after developing additional information that showed he\nowed these debts. His actions indicate a good-faith effort on his part to resolve these\ndebts.\nAn Applicant can mitigate security concerns under AG \u00b6 20(e) when \u201cthe\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthe dispute evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputed the debt in\nSOR allegation 1.e after receiving the interrogatories and prior to October 16, 2008, two\nmonths before the issuance of the SOR. He continued to dispute this debt with the\ncredit reporting companies and the collection agency, which now holds the debt. His\ndispute of this debt is legitimate, because he paid all his debts with the original creditor\nthrough his earlier payment plan. Applicant continually denied owing a cable bill. His\ndecision to file a fraud report, following the hearing arose after further investigation and\ndiscussions with Department Counsel about this debt, is reasonable in light of his\ncontinued denial of this bill. These discussions provided him further insight on how to\naddress the issue of this bill. Applicant also disputed the debt in allegation 1.c after the\nhearing. He continually denied any knowledge of this creditor. The credit reports failed\nto identify the original creditor, and did not list an address or telephone number for this\ncreditor. Thus, Applicant had no way to contact the creditor or pay the debt if it was his.\nGiven that the Appeal Board considered this debt proven, Applicant properly disputed\nafter remand under these facts. This mitigating condition applies to SOR allegations 1.c,\n1.e, and 1.n only.\n\n11\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or deny a\nsecurity clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nApplicant paid the following SOR debts: 1.b ($24,701), 1.d (401), 1.e ($4,660), 1.f\n($5,699), 1.g ($541), 1.h ($3,463), 1.k ($1,941), 1.l ($340), and 1.m ($1,017). His credit\nreports listed many paid non-SOR debts, including at least five personal loans, several\nstore accounts, four or more credit card accounts, and car leases. In assessing whether\nan applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F, the Appeal Board provided\nthe following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\n\n12\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole-person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. His financial\nproblems are the result, in part, of poor choices made about spending money. While\nproviding care and money for medicine for his ailing father, Applicant incurred significant\ndebt, which he tried to pay. For four years after his father died, he unsuccessfully\nattempted to pay his debts. In 1998, he sought and received financial counseling\nthrough a debt consolidation company. Through this company, he developed a payment\nplan to address his large debts. For the next seven years, he routinely paid the\ncounseling service, which then paid his creditors until the bills were paid. His decision to\nseek help with his finances and his compliance with the program shows that he not only\nacted in a responsible manner, but that he is willing to accept responsibility for his\ndebts. He completed his payment plan, resolving his largest debts, several of which are\nlisted in the SOR. During this period of time, he repaid his federal tax lien and more\nthrough a substantial wage garnishment, which impacted his available net income. To\nfurther help with managing his finances and family obligations, he obtained a second\nfull-time job. Through these efforts, he resolved much of his debt.  After losing his\nsecond job in 2004, Applicant encountered some financial difficulties, but not to the level\nhe incurred in the 1990s. Over the last five years, he has worked slowly to resolve his\nnew financial issues. His one major unpaid debt, the judgment, is not resolved or being\nresolved because the creditor is uncooperative, not for lack of effort on Applicant\u2019s part.\nBecause of his long history of debt resolution, his statement that he tried to resolve the\njudgment debt is credible.\n \nApplicant has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent\ndebts raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) He has not paid the cable bill, a cell\nphone bill, and a collection debt listed in the SOR because these debts are not his or\nunknown to him. These debts represent about 15 % of the debts listed in the SOR.\nEven though he has had financial problems, he has demonstrated a meaningful track\nrecord of debt repayment. He is not required to be debt free to hold a security\nclearance. Rather, he must manage his finances and live within his financial means.\nThe newer credit reports show that Applicant pays his current bills, has resolved many\nof his old debts, has paid many his of debts in a timely manner, and has done so\nthrough his financial difficulties.\n\n13\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has worked in his Department of State contractor job since 1989, with the exception of one year between 1994 and 1995 and two months in late 1997 and early 1998. He holds a top secret clearance. 1 Applicant graduated from high school, then attended a technical school for data processing training. He recently attended a bartender school and is certified as a bartender. He worked a second full-time job from 2000 until 2004, when his employer laid him off. As a result of the lay off, his income decreased from $108,000 a year to Tr. 75, 79-80, 84-85. 2 GE 1, supra note 2; Tr. 25, 70-72, 85-86, 89. 3 AE A; Tr. 96-98, 117. 4 AE E (Leave and earnings statement showing garnishment); AE F (Leave and earnings statements showing 5 garnishment), total at 21; Tr. 29-31, 67-68.

He has not worked a second job since 2004, but he is now seeking part-time employment as a bartender.2 Applicant married in 1989. He and his wife separated in 2001, but have not divorced. For several years after his separation, Applicant continued to pay the car insurance and car payment on his wife\u2019s car. He stopped making these payments when he lost his second job in 2004. He has a 25 year-old son, who lives independently and is a diabetic. He regularly provides his son with money to pay for insulin, as his son is often short on cash.3 Applicant\u2019s father died in 1994. For several years prior to his father\u2019s death, Applicant regularly traveled between his home and his father\u2019s home, about 150 miles away, to help care for his father. He also helped his father pay for medications and has helped other family members with expenses. He used his credit cards to pay for these expenses. By 1998, his debt overwhelmed him. He enrolled in a credit management program. From October 1998 through August 2005, he paid approximately $550 a month to this company, which then paid his creditors. Through this program, he resolved many of his outstanding debts.4 In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against him personally. IRS collected the moneys due through a bi-monthly garnishment on his wages. From May 2003 until approximately November 2004, Applicant paid the IRS $1,166 twice a month for a total payment of more than $44,000.5 The SOR lists numerous debts, which are listed at least once on each credit report and sometimes more than once because the debt is under other creditor\u2019s names. After reviewing the credit reports dated November 4, 2004, May 25, 2006, August 12, 2008, October 16, 2008, and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed, excluding any duplicat",
    "judges_analysis": "",
    "discussion": ", the status of some debts was determined. Applicant again denied any knowledge of the creditor in SOR allegation 1.c. (Creditor C). Creditor C first appeared on the credit report dated August 12, 2008 and again on the October 16, 2008 credit report. Creditor C is a credit collection company, not the original creditor. The original creditor is unknown. The August 12, 2008 credit report indicated that Applicant became delinquent on this account in March 2008. This credit report also had an extensive list of creditors with the relevant contact addresses and telephone numbers, but it did not have any information GE 2; AE K; Tr. 31-40. 14 GE 2; GE 4; GE 5; AE A; AE J; AE K.. 15 6 regarding Creditor C. The Government agreed that neither credit report provided an address or telephone number for Creditor C, leaving Applicant without any means to obtain information from Creditor C about this debt and to pay the debt, if his. (Tr. 37-39). Applicant challenged this debt with one of the credit reporting companies, following the remand decision of the Appeal Board. Creditor C is not listed on Applicant\u2019s latest credit report, dated February 13, 2010, which is from a company which previously listed the Creditor C debt. Since the debt became delinquent in March 2008, the credit reporting company did not remove Creditor C because the information was stale. Under these facts, I find that the debt owed Creditor C has been removed as a result of his challenge.14 Applicant disputed the debt in SOR allegation 1.e (Creditor E-$4,660) sometime prior to the issuance of the SOR, as shown on the August 12, 2008 credit report. Applicant continued to dispute this debt. He filed a second dispute with the credit reporting agency and a dispute directly with Creditor E, the collection agency. The information provided to Applicant by Creditor E, after receiving his dispute, indicated that the debt is a personal loan Applicant obtained from Bank A in March 2001. The November 4, 2004 credit report shows a personal loan with Bank B that was being managed by a financial counseling service, and a credit card with Bank A that was either closed or past due or with no balance. The May 25, 2006 credit report reflects that the personal loan debt with Bank B was closed/paid and had a zero balance, and that the credit card debt with Bank A had been sold to Bank B. Creditor E, the current creditor, purchased one debt in April 2006 from Bank B. The August 12, 2008 credit report showed that one of the Bank B accounts (not specified) was paid, transferred, or derogatory. Based on information from the credit reports, I find that the Creditor E debt is the credit card debt that originated at Bank A, then transferred to Bank B, and later sold to Creditor E, which now holds the debt. Applicant provided a history of his debt repayment program from October 1998 through February 2005. This record showed two separate accounts with Bank B and three different account numbers for Bank B. The personal loan account number is listed for this program. The remaining two account numbers do not match the account numbers listed on the May 25, 2006 and August 12, 2008 credit reports for Bank B. However, the credit reports going back to November 2004 do not show more than two accounts with Bank B and Bank A. After reviewing all the information of record, I find that the credit card account that originated at Bank A, then transferred to Bank B, and later sold to Creditor E, which now holds the debt was included in the debt repayment program.15 At the hearing, Applicant did not deny he had accounts with the creditors listed in SOR allegations 1.d, 1g, and 1.l. He denied owing these creditors any money, as he believed the debts had been paid. After the hearing, he paid the debts. His change in Applicant testified to having several satellite accounts. 16 Response to SOR; AE B; AE G; Tr. 49-50, 64-67. 17 AE K. 18 GE 5; AE A; AE E; AE F. 19 GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; AE K. 20 7 position is not explained. Concerning the debts in SOR allegations 1.f and 1.h, which are the same debt, Applicant testified that a settlement offer had been made. Subsequent to the hearing, the creditor accepted his offer and he paid the debt. Applicant consistently denied owing the debt in SOR allegation 1.n, stating that his cable account had been paid. Following the hearing and after further discussion with 16 Department Counsel and investigation, Applicant decided to file an identity theft report on this debt. This debt is now disputed. He did not file a similar report on any other debt. 17 Applicant denied the debt in SOR allegation 1.i because he did not recognize the creditor. This debt is currently owned by a credit collection agency, which listed as the original creditor, a creditor unknown to Applicant. Applicant has not resolved or disputed this debt.18 The debts in SOR allegations 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n are listed on the November 2004 credit report.

On November 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 10, 2008. He \nanswered the SOR in writing on January 12, 2009, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 12, 2009. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 16, 2009, and I received the case \nassignment on April 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 27, 2009 and I \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on May 12, 2009.

Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 12, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n of the SOR, with explanations. He denied all the other \nfactual allegations in the SOR concerning any alleged delinquent debt. His defense was \nthat his former wife owed all the alleged debts. He provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old, married to his fourth wife, and is employed as a senior \nsoftware engineer by a defense contractor.  He does not have a security clearance now.  \nHe earns $108,000 annually, and has a net remainder income each month of about \n$5,000.  He has one daughter who is 30 years old.  He married his third wife in 1984, to \nwhom he was married while they accumulated about $51,000 in delinquent debt.  He \nbecame aware of his wife\u2019s mismanagement of their funds in 1995.  He knew in 1994 \nabout two tax liens against him from 1988 and 1989, yet took no action to resolve them.  \nApplicant has not filed his 2002 and 2004 Federal income tax returns.  Applicant does \nnot know the status of his state income tax returns for those years.  He filed his 2006 \nthrough 2008 Federal and state tax returns. He admitted these facts in his Answer. (Tr. \n21-25, 30, 33, 37, 64; Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 10) \n \n \nApplicant has 11 delinquent debts totaling $51,015 listed in the SOR.  He has not \nrepaid or otherwise resolved any of these debts. Applicant gave his former wife a \ngeneral power of attorney in the early 1990s to manage his finances, and never revoked \nit.  He never looked at his finances during their marriage, even after his 1995 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy.  He states all the debts are the responsibility of his former third wife.  She \naccepts responsibility for them in the Answer and her undated letter entered into the \nrecord as Exhibit A.  Applicant trusts her to pay these debts and clean up his credit \nrecord after she inherits her money from someone. (Tr. 30, 31, 33, 39-54, 63; Exhibits \n2-12) \n \n \nApplicant owes a state $6,096, $10,007, $8,703, and $5,854 on four separate tax \nliens (SOR Para. 1. a, 1.b, 1.k, and 1.l) for the 1986, 1988 and 1989 tax years.  He \nowes another state $2,687 on a different tax lien (SOR Para. 1. a to c) for the 1992 and \n1993 tax years.  All five tax liens remain unpaid.  Applicant took no action to resolve \nthese liens, even after he learned of them in 1994. (Tr. 39 to 43; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n \nA natural gas utility is owed $402 on a bill (SOR Para. 1.d).  This bill remains \nunpaid.  Applicant took no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 44; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant owes a car maker $8,880 on a judgment (SOR Para. 1.e).  This debt \nremains unpaid. Applicant took no action to resolve it. (Tr. 45-47; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n \nApplicant owes a credit card provider $1,332 (SOR Para. 1.f).  This debt remains \nunpaid.  Applicant took no action to resolve this debt after learning of it in 2007 when \nquestioned about it by the Government investigator. (Tr. 47; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n \nA telephone company placed Applicant\u2019s account for collection, seeking $2,240 \n(SOR Para. 1.g).  This debt remains unpaid.  Applicant took no action to resolve this \ndebt. (Tr. 51; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n \nApplicant owes another credit card company $3,553 (SOR Para. 1.h).  This debt \nalso remains unpaid.  Applicant has done nothing to resolve this debt. (Tr. 53; Exhibits \n2-12) \n \n \nApplicant owes a bank $1,261 on an account (SOR Para. 1.i). This debt is \nunpaid.  Applicant denies any knowledge of this debt and has not taken any action to \nresolve it. (Tr. 53; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s home was foreclosed in August 2006 (SOR Para. 1.j).  Applicant has \nnot paid the balance due on this mortgage.  Applicant denies any knowledge of any \nhome foreclosure. (Tr. 54; Exhibits 2-12) \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on November 13, 1995.  He was discharged \nof his debts in bankruptcy on February 14, 1996.  The delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR in the previous paragraphs occurred after the bankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 29; \nExhibit 11) \n \n \nApplicant was ordered to pay his former wife $3,000 monthly in alimony from \n2006 until 2008.  He did so, and after the legal obligation to pay expired, he continued to \npay her $2,000 monthly to help her.  He estimates he has paid her about $100,000 in \nthe past three years.  Applicant\u2019s net monthly income after all deductions and expenses \nis about $1,000, which he saves in his checking account.  He now has $7,000 in that \naccount.  His car is paid and his rent is $850 per month.  Applicant has not sought or \nreceived any financial counseling. (Tr. 55-73) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes four of nine disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns.  They apply in this case.  \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying.  AG \u00b6 19(b) applies because of the irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any effort to repay the debts or enter into installment payment agreements. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated 11 delinquent debts, totaling about $51,000, \nand did not pay these obligations for several years, including the current year. His \ntestimony shows he did not engage himself in any effort to resolve these debts, or stop \naccumulating them, even after his 1995 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant disengaged \nhimself from his finances and now seeks to avoid responsibility for his debts. His \nrepeated failure to pay his taxes to two states and the Federal government is a serious \nlegal problem that he has not resolved for 23 years, in the case of the earliest tax lien.  \nThat fact triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(g). The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  There are six mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial worries arose between 1984 when he \nmarried his third wife and 2006 when he divorced her.  His irresponsible behavior \ncontinues to the present day as he refuses to repay the debts.  There is a regular \npattern of going into debt and not taking any action to resolve those financial \nobligations.  Applicant has a constant history of this type of action. The evidence does \nnot raise this potentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), the financial problems arose from his wife=s failure to pay the \nfamily debts and Applicant refusing to do anything to rectify her misconduct, even when \nhis name appeared as an oblige of the debt. Applicant also failed continuously to \nmonitor and manage properly the family finances and arrange the repayment of their \ndebts incurred during the marriage. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a \nfactor for consideration in this case.  \n \nFor AG & 20(c) to apply Applicant would have to present evidence of counseling \nor that the problem is under control.  In fact, the debts remain unpaid, and Applicant has \nplaced the entire repayment obligation on his wife.  He has the income and ability to \nrepay the debts, but has not done so since they were incurred.  He admitted he had not \nundertaken any financial counseling. \n \nApplicant has not resolved any of the delinquent debts, either by payment or \nsettlement. He places the burden on his former wife, aided by her written statement that \nthe debts occurred when her company failed.  She admits in the statement in the \nAnswer that she handled the debts irresponsibly (Answer and Exhibit A).  She did not \ntestify at the hearing, and was not subject to cross-examination.  Applicant was aware \nof these debts for several years, and did nothing to rectify them.  Instead, he has paid \nhis former wife alimony as ordered in the court for the specified time, and then \nvoluntarily continued to support her.  He estimates he paid her $100,000 since their \ndivorce.  He claims his former wife will pay these debts at some time in the future when \nshe inherits an undisclosed amount of money from an unnamed benefactor. Applicant \noffered no written documents evidencing this commitment. If true, he would have been \nbetter off to pay his $51,000 in debts and seek reimbursement later from the person \nwho caused his financial problem in the first place.  He did not, further demonstrating \nhis poor judgment in financial matters. I conclude AG & 20(d) does not apply. \n \nThe final mitigating condition of AG \u00b6 20 (f) pertains to affluence resulting from a \nlegal source of income.  Applicant testified he earned over $100,000 annually, and has \na net monthly income remainder of about $2,000.  His income was spent on his former \nwife\u2019s needs, and his current family.  He alleges affluence being inherited by his former \nwife, but it has not occurred yet.  This mitigating condition is not applicable.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant did not pay attention to \nhis financial debts between 1984 and 2006, and allowed them to accumulate. He \ncompletely abdicated his duty to pay his debts during that time period.  Even when on \nnotice of a problem after his 1995 bankruptcy, he still purposefully remained oblivious to \nhis debts and financial status.  After the November 26, 2008, SOR was sent to him, \nApplicant did nothing to repay his debts.  He has acted irresponsibly for 23 years about \nfinancial matters. \n \n His former wife may claim the debts are her responsibility, but Applicant has had \nample time to rectify the situation by repaying them or resolving them in installment \npayment plans over the past 14 years.  Both Applicant and his wife have done nothing \nto repay debt, except file bankruptcy in 1995.  Then they incur more debt.  These are \nactions of an irresponsible Applicant lacking in good judgment.    \n \nThe burden of proof being on him, Applicant failed to present his former wife in \nperson to give testimony about the debts.  He also failed to take the initiative and \nresolve the debts, or to seek reimbursement from his former wife if she persists in \naccepting responsibility for those debts.  All these actions show a lack of good judgment \nby Applicant.  The conduct by this adult was continuous, voluntary, and frequent.  He \nhas made no changes in his behavior to take responsibility to resolve any of the debts.  \nHe is subject to pressure and coercion because of the magnitude of his delinquent debt.  \nThe conduct is continuing.  His explanation of trusting his wife to pay the debts and \nclean up his credit report one day in the future when she inherits an undisclosed amount \n\n \n8 \n \n \nof money is not credible or persuasive.  Applicant was evasive in the explanation of this \nsupposed inheritance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against him. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 17 debts totaling $24,767. She \nstated one debt was over seven years old, a $42 debt was paid, and one debt was in a \npayment plan. The other debts were admitted, but not resolved. She failed to disclose \nher delinquent debts on her security clearance application. Applicant failed to mitigate \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 24, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 4). \nOn December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an \nSOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and \nmodified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nJune 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nDecember 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 31, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 6, 2009, was \nprovided to her, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not provide a response \nto the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June 11, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations, except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e (Item 3). After a complete and thorough review \nof the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 She is a supervisor \nin a security team. She has worked for the same employer since 1995. She attended \ncollege and was awarded a cosmetology license in 1993. She married in 1979 and \ndivorced in 1998. She married in 1998 and divorced in 2000. She married in 2001 and is \ncurrently married. She does not have any children. She has never served in the U.S. \nmilitary. She has never been fired from a job or left employment under adverse \ncircumstances. Her file does not contain any adverse information relating to police \ninvolvement. For example, she has never been charged with a felony, any firearms or \nexplosives offense(s), and does not have any currently pending charges. She has never \nbeen charged with any offense related to alcohol or drugs. She has not been arrested \nfor or charged with any other misdemeanor-level offenses. There is no evidence that \nshe has abused alcohol or drugs.  \n \n \n \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated April 16, 2009; \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated April 22, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she \nhad 30 days after her receipt to submit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3The facts in this paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s October 24, 2007, security clearance application \n(Item 4). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists 17 delinquent debts, totaling $24,767 as follows: \u00b6 1.a \n($11,098); \u00b6 1.b ($1,735); \u00b6 1.c ($1,664); \u00b6 1.d ($250); \u00b6 1.e ($42); \u00b6 1.f ($94); \u00b6 1.g \n($697); \u00b6 1.h ($776); \u00b6 1.i ($1,733); \u00b6 1.j ($2,488); \u00b6 1.k ($264); \u00b6 1.l ($490); \u00b6 1.m \n($740); \u00b6 1.n ($319); \u00b6 1.o ($1,624); \u00b6 1.p ($260); and \u00b6 1.q ($493) (Item 1). Her SOR \nresponse admits all debts except she indicates the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is denied because \nit is over seven years old (Item 3). She admits the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $42, a \ndepartment store credit card; however, she describes it as caught up (Item 3).  \n \nOn July 23, 2008, DOHA provided a list of ten delinquent accounts to Applicant \nand asked her to verify the status of those accounts and provide proof of any \npayments.4 Applicant requested a loan; however, it was denied because of her financial \nsituation. She provided a copy of the denial from the financial institution. She explained \nthat she and her husband are considering filing for bankruptcy. She said she was going \nto address the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,735), and she provided a letter from the \ncreditor indicating automatic $50 monthly payments would start on July 22, 2008. She \ndid not provide proof of any payments made to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b. She \nmentioned that recently her mother and sister-in-law died; however, she did not explain \nwhy or how those deaths contributed to her financial predicament.  \n \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling that she received. Applicant \ndid not provide any documentation showing she disputed the validity of any debts.  \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Application \n \nApplicant signed her security clearance applicant on October 24, 2007. In regard \nto her financial record, Applicant disclosed that she was involved in a repossession in \nMarch 2003 (Item 4). However, when asked about her delinquent debts, Applicant \nincorrectly responded, \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28a and 28b (Item 4), which asked: \n \nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)? \n \nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application contains the following admonition: \n \nCertification That My Answers Are True \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \n \n4The facts in this paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories, dated July \n23, 2008 (Item 7). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(emphasis in original) (Item 4). Immediately below this admonition is Applicant\u2019s \nsignature. A credit report, dated November 15, 2007, lists numerous debts that were \ncurrently past due, and that were past due for more than 180 days (on November 15, \n2007), including many debts that were past due for more than a year (Item 5). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admits falsification of her October 24, 2007 security \nclearance application (Item 3). \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, in her \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, and in her SOR response. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.q, she had 17 delinquent debts totaling about $24,767 disclosed as potential \nsecurity concerns. She provided enough information to reduce security concerns on two \ndebts (she paid one debt and the other debt was in a payment plan). Her financial \ndifficulties extended over several years and continue today. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her 17 delinquent \ndebts. Her delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because she did not establish that her financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether she is fully committed to resolving her delinquent SOR \ndebts and is making adequate steps to do so. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because she \ndid not provide any documentation disputing any of the SOR debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was probably \ndamaged by deaths in her family and divorce. The cost of funerals and resolving estates \nis very expensive. Similarly, divorce results in a division of assets, property and debts. \nDivorce can cause financial hardship. She evidently lacks sufficient income to address \nmost of her delinquent SOR debts. She has not provided sufficient evidence to establish \nthat she acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to her delinquent \ndebts.5  \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not receive formal financial \ncounseling, she probably received some financial advice from the financial institution \nthat denied her loan, and has otherwise learned about financial issues. She started the \nprocess of paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant has resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \n($42) by paying it. She did not provide any evidence of any arrangements to pay any of \nthe other SOR debts. These are some initial, positive \u201cindications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control.\u201d She has also established some mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20(d) because Applicant showed some good faith6 in the resolution of her SOR debts \nby attempting to secure a loan to repay her creditors.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. She attempted to borrow funds to pay her \ncreditors. She generated a payment plan for one delinquent SOR debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and \nsaid she paid one SOR debt for $42 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). These steps are simply inadequate to \nfully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

She admitted in her SOR response that her \nanswers were false. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The falsification is established. She \nadmitted the falsification of her security clearance application without elaboration or \nfurther explanation.7 Applicant has not provided sufficient information to refute or un-\nsubstantiate the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of her clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for volunteering to \nsupport the Department of Defense in the field of security. She has served well, rising to \na supervisory position. The same employer has retained her service for 13 years. This \nlongevity speaks very well for her contributions to her employer. There is no evidence \nthat she has a criminal record or has ever violated security. There is every indication \n \n7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nthat she is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, her employer and that \nshe is an honorable person. There were no allegations of security violations. She does \nnot abuse alcohol or illegal drugs. She has attended college. She is evidently not \nsophisticated in the area of finance. She made mistakes, and her debts became \ndelinquent. Expenses from her divorce and deaths in her family may have contributed to \nher financial woes. She probably learned some financial information when she applied \nfor a loan and reviewed the DOHA documentation. She paid one small debt and placed \nanother debt into a payment plan. She has a track record of successful employment \nworking for a DoD contractor. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, \nand mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or responsible. \nApplicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. She began to have financial \ndifficulties several years ago, when multiple debts became delinquent. In July 2008, she \nreceived DOHA interrogatories and in December 2008, she received the SOR. She had \nample opportunity to contact more of her SOR creditors and to make greater progress in \nthe resolution of her SOR debts. She paid one small delinquent SOR debt for $42, and \nstarted a $50 monthly payment plan on another SOR debt. She attempted to obtain a \nloan to repay her creditors. She is thinking about filing for bankruptcy. She made \ninsufficient progress over the last 18 months to resolve her delinquent debts, even \nthough she had steady employment and ample opportunity to contact her creditors and \nprovide documentation. She was on clear notice from her receipt of DOHA \ninterrogatories and even more so after she received the SOR that she needed to show \nsubstantial progress in the resolution of her delinquent debts; however, she made \ninsufficient effort to accomplish this security responsibility.    \n   \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of her security clearance application is not mitigated. She \nadmitted that she falsified her security clearance application, and she did not provide \nany explanation for her conduct. The falsification occurred in October 2007, which is still \nrelatively recent.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. I take \nthis position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, \nmy application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my \ninterpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to \nmitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is \nnot eligible for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f to 1.q:  \n Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on November 26, 2007. On December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal \nconduct) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 3, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, which DOHA \nreceived on January 7, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June \n30, 2009. The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge on July 1, \n2009, but due to caseload considerations was reassigned to me on September 1, \n2009. DOHA had previously issued a notice of hearing on July 30, 2009, scheduling \nthe hearing for August 25, 2009, which was canceled on August 24, 2009. DOHA \nissued a second notice of hearing on September 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nOctober 28, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until November 17, 2009, to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted \nAE E through M, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 5, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a. to correct the date from \n\u201cNovember 200\u201d to November 2000.\u201d Without objection, I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s request. Tr. 56. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.i., which he denied with explanation. His answers with explanations are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old electrician technician, who has worked for his \ndefense contractor employer since April 2005. GE 1, Tr. 15-16. He is a first-time \napplicant for a security clearance. Tr. 15-16.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1992. GE 1, Tr. 17. He has never \nmarried and has no dependents. GE 1, Tr. 16-17. Applicant lives as a nuclear family \nwith a woman and her two children, an 18-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl. \nApplicant provides support for his girlfriend and her two children. His girlfriend works \nas a waitress, and does not receive any support from the father of her children. Tr. 47-\n48, 60-64. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his November 2007 e-QIP, his July 2008 Response to DOHA \nFinancial Interrogatory, and his December 2007, September 2008, and April 2009 \ncredit reports. GE 1 \u2013 5.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified nine separate debts -- one repossession, two \njudgments, two charged off accounts, and four collection accounts, approximating \n$23,000.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stem from a live-in relationship he had with a \nformer girlfriend in the approximate time frame of 1999 to 2002. At the time Applicant \nwas involved with this woman, he was working offshore on oil rigs in the Gulf of \nMexico. His job on the oil rigs required him to be absent for significant periods of time. \nDuring these absences, Applicant provided his former girlfriend with money to cover \nhousehold expenses such as mobile home payments, utilities, food, and the like. \nUnfortunately, Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend developed a substance abuse problem and \ndiverted the money he gave her for household expenses to support her habit. By the \ntime Applicant discovered that his finances were in chaos, it was too late. Applicant \nsevered his relationship with that girlfriend in 2002. Tr. 18-21. \n \nThe financial fallout from this experience has had lingering repercussions. After \nevaluating his options, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on \nNovember 29, 2000. He later voluntarily dismissed his petition on July 18, 2002.1 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Response to SOR, GE 6. Following dismissal, Applicant ratified his debts \nand \u201cpulled them out of bankruptcy.\u201d The debts in the SOR were primarily incurred \nduring the time frame Applicant was involved in his former relationship. Tr. 64. Given \nApplicant\u2019s financial resources and obligations to his family, it has taken time for him \nto recover. Since 2005, he has established a track record of paying his debts, with the \nexception of his older debts listed in the SOR. GE 2 \u2013 4, Tr. 24.  \n \nApplicant has paid, settled, initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors, or resolved all debts alleged. Applicant has paid debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c., and 1.e., and has made payment arrangements or is in the process of making \npayments for the debts alleged in \u00b6 1.d., 1.g., and 1.j. He is engaged in good-faith \ndisputes for debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.h., and 1.i. Applicant has written letters or \nmade telephone calls, or both, with the creditors he has made payment arrangements \nwith or with those creditors he is disputing. Tr. 22-38, 78, GE 5, GE 9, AE A \u2013 J. \n \n \n \n \n \n1 The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 was dismissed in April 2002. However, GE 6 lists the \ndismissal date as July 18, 2002. GE 6 is an extract of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a budget with his monthly expenses that demonstrates that \nhe is living within his means. AE K. \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to disclose events that occurred in the \nseven years preceding the completion of his November 2007 e-QIP: his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, his mobile home repossession, his two judgments filed against him, and \ndebts over 180 days old. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \u2013 2.d.)  Applicant credibly testified that he \nbelieved all of the financial information sought was beyond the seven-year period. It \nwas his belief that he had filed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition before November \n2000 and the debts in question were included in that bankruptcy petition. In any event, \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was filed on November 29, 2000, and his \ne-QIP was submitted on November 26, 2007, three days short of seven years. \nResponse to SOR, Tr. 83-84. Applicant summarized his mistake, \u201cBut I just had my \ndate wrong (bankruptcy filing date) when I filed it (e-QIP).\u201d Tr. 85. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant provided a character reference letter from his team leader, who has \nknown Applicant for four years. He described Applicant as a \u201ctremendous worker,\u201d \nwhose \u201cperformance has been exemplary,\u201d adding that he \u201chas successfully \ndemonstrated leadership and has been a great help to our customers.\u201d AE L. \nApplicant also submitted his most recent performance evaluation covering January to \nDecember 2009, which reflects above average performance. AE M. \n \nApplicant leads a modest lifestyle, does not take vacations, and supports two \nchildren not his own. Tr. 47-49. In his spare time, he hunts in the winter and fishes in \nthe summer. Applicant is actively involved in the lives of his girlfriend\u2019s two teenage \nchildren. Tr. 86-88. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct). \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  . . .  delinquent [SOR] debts that \nare of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in \nhis responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response, and his oral statement at \nhis hearing. He failed or was unable to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct warrants full application of AG \u00b6 20(a).  His debts were \nincurred during a previous failed relationship that ended in 2002. These debts were \nincluded in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in November 2000, which he voluntarily \ndismissed in July 2002. Applicant has been involved in a stable relationship for some \ntime and has made substantial progress in resolving his lingering debts with his \navailable means. Apart from these \u201cold debts,\u201d he remains current on all of his bills \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b). \n                                                          \nand lives within his means. He continues to make progress and his delinquent debts \nare likely to be paid or resolved, and are unlikely to recur. They do not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant receives credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \nresulted when his former girlfriend diverted household money to support her \nsubstance abuse habit. Applicant severed this relationship in 2002; however, the \nfinancial fallout from this experience lingers.2 He receives full mitigating credit \nbecause he established that he acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address \nhis delinquent debts. Applicant provided sufficient documentation about his income \nand expenditures to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20\n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not seek financial \ncounseling, he has prepared a detailed budget. Moreover, he demonstrated a firm \ngrasp of budgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. He leads a modest \nlifestyle, lives within his means, and manages to remain current on his present \nobligations yet still managed to make payments to former creditors. He has the self-\ndiscipline necessary to reduce and resolve his debts. There are \u201cclear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has also established full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed good faith3 in the resolution of his \nSOR debts.   \n \nApplicant contested the validity of several of his debts. Applicant submitted \ndocumentation supporting the basis of his disputes with creditors. He receives credit \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A \ncomponent is whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nunder AG \u00b6 20(e). I am further convinced if any of his creditors establish that Applicant \nowes them money, he will repay them.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He is current \non his payment plans. He took the honorable route of validating his debts and is in the \nprocess of repaying his creditors. While his journey to financial responsibility is not yet \ncomplete, I am confident he will keep his promise because of his continued progress \non SOR debt resolution.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false \nsecurity clearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or \nomitted required information on his November 2007 e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s alleged \nfalsification of Section 27 of his e-QIP is not substantiated. AG \u00b6 17(f) provides a \ncondition that could mitigate security concerns in this case, stating, \u201cthe information \nwas unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f) fully \napplies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \u2013 2.d. Although he admitted preparing his e-QIP, and \nanswering incorrectly, he honestly and reasonably believed that he was outside the \nseven-year window envisioned by the question.4  \n \n4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden \nof proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n  \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. His debts have been \nongoing for a number of years. His delinquent debts raise security concerns. However, \nthe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence of \nany security violation. Aside from the delinquent debt (which is a civil, non-criminal \nissue), he is a law-abiding citizen. The overall amount of debt is relatively low. The \nAppeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial \ncases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \n \nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a \nJudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is \ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at \nthe time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June \n9, 2004)). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant is a high school \ngraduate, who is an electrician technician. He is not sophisticated in the areas of \nfinance. He made a poor choice in a previous relationship, and is still paying the \nconsequences today. There is no reason not to trust his promise to pay his creditors. \nThe record supports the fact that he has paid numerous debts over the years. He has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payment sufficient to trust his promise \nto pay or otherwise resolve his debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, \nand mitigation. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness \nthrough his service as an employee of a defense contractor.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.j.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.d.:  \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 7, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 13, 2009, and DOHA received \nhis answer on May 15, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July \nApril 28, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n28, 2009. The case was assigned to me on July 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 21, 2009, scheduling the hearing for September 25, 2009. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until October 9, 2009, to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant submitted AE L \nthrough N, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 2, 2009. The record closed on October 9, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. His answers \nwith explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review \nof the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old process technician, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since November 1985. He seeks to retain his secret security \nclearance, which is a requirement for his continued employment. Applicant has \nsuccessfully held a clearance for the majority of his employment with his company. \n(GE 1, Tr. 29, 32-36.)  \n \nAfter graduating from high school in approximately May 1975, Applicant \nattended college for three years, but did not graduate. He later attended a community \ncollege from August 1994 to May 1995, and was awarded a certificate as a licensed \npractical nurse.  (GE 1, Tr. 39-42.)  \n \nApplicant did not serve in the armed forces. He was married from June 1989 to \nMarch 1995. That marriage ended by divorce. Applicant has an eight-year-old son \nfrom a previous relationship for whom he pays $800 monthly in child support. (GE 1, \nTr. 30-32, 36-38.) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his March 1997 Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF-86), his November 2007 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), DOHA\u2019s September 2008 Interrogatories, his November 2008 Response to \nInterrogatories, his August 1996 Chapter 13 bankruptcy record, his August 2002 \nDefense Security Service signed, sworn, statement, as well as his June 1997, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDecember 2007, July 2008, December 2008, January 2009, and July 2009 credit \nreports. GE 1 \u2013 12. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 12 separate debts -- one voluntary repossession, \nfour charged off accounts, and seven collection accounts, totaling about $26,000. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 1996 \nand was awarded a discharge in August 2002.  Applicant was unable to remain \ncurrent on his debts after his 1995 divorce. Particularly challenging was going from a \ntwo-income household to a one-income household. After evaluating his options, \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection and repaid his creditors in \naccordance with his repayment plan. (GE 11, Tr. 42-45.)  \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant had knee surgery and went on a six-week medical \nleave. During this time, he was on disability and his pay was reduced by 25%.  Then, \nfrom November 2006 to January 2007, his union went on strike, requiring their \nmembers to join the picket line. On the advice of Applicant\u2019s physician, he did not \npicket, fearing that day-long picketing would hinder his recovery. Applicant testified \nunion representatives were sympathetic to his dilemma; however, they informed him if \nhe did not join the picket line, he would not receive subsistence payments from the \nstrike fund.   \n \nDuring this time, Applicant\u2019s living expenses continued to include paying his \nparents approximately $500 per month in rent. Applicant also chose to loan money to \na colleague and friend of his, who also was on strike and a single mother. She stated \nApplicant \u201chelped me out quite a bit, he paid a couple of my car payments and my \nelectric bill, he also helped me several times buy food for me and my children.\u201d   When \nApplicant went back to work in January 2007, he was seriously in arrears on his debts \nand \u201cthe damage was done.\u201d In February 2007, he injured his arm and was out of \nwork for another six weeks. (GE 7, pgs. I-6 through I-9, Tr. 47-50, 69-75.)  \n \nApplicant consulted a bankruptcy attorney, who advised him to file Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Reluctantly, Applicant did so \u201cas my last resort.\u201d He filed his Chapter 7 \npetition in April 2009 and was awarded a discharge in September 2009. All 12 of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR were included on Applicant\u2019s Schedule E and were \ndischarged. (GE 7, I-6, AE A, Tr. 42-69, 78.) Excluding debts listed on his Schedule E, \nApplicant has been current on his bills for \u201cabout a year.\u201d (Tr. 80-81.) Applicant \ncompleted the mandatory financial counseling required in conjunction with filing \nbankruptcy. (AE L.) \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has resolved all of the debts alleged. He submitted a \nbudget with his monthly expenses that reflects a net remainder of $1,200. His budget \nfurther demonstrates that he maintains a modest lifestyle and is living within his \nmeans. (AE M.)  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant provided three personal reference letters from friends. A 30-year \nfriend, who is an elementary school principal, described Applicant as \u201chonest, \ndependable, reliable, and hard working.\u201d Another friend said \u201c[Applicant] would never \ndo anything to compromise his position . . . .\u201d Lastly, a five-year friend described \nApplicant as \u201c. . . a valuable friend and asset to his job and community.\u201d (AE B, AE F, \nAE H.) \n \nApplicant provided two reference letters from family members. His sister said \nApplicant \u201chas taken the responsibility of looking after our parents,\u201d and added that he \nis \u201chonest and reliable.\u201d His parents said \u201c[w]e just want you to know that we are most \ngrateful that we have a son that was and still is there for us,\u201d  adding \u201c[w]e now know \nthat bankruptcy was never his first choice, we saw him exhaust all avenues trying to \nresolve all this.\u201d (AE E, AE G.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent work performance evaluation for 2008-2009 describes \nApplicant\u2019s solid performance and contribution to the defense industry. (AE N.) All \npersons submitting reference letters recommend that Applicant be granted a security \nclearance. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AGs. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and evidence \npresented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. to 1.m., he had 12 delinquent debts totaling \nabout $26,000 that have been in various states of delinquency since at least 2005. \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct warrants partial application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) because he did \nnot act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debt. Because \nthere is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not isolated. It was \nnot until 2009 that these debts were resolved. Therefore, his debt is \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. \n16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d His 12-year-old \nChapter 13 bankruptcy lacks security significance because of the passage of time and \nbecause all debts were repaid.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant receives full mitigation because of wages lost \nduring his 2006 six-week medical leave, wages lost during his company strike from \nOctober 2006 to January 2007, and financial help given to his aged parents and to a \nlesser extent his friend. Applicant\u2019s medical situation and the union strike were beyond \nhis control. Applicant\u2019s conduct towards his parents was selfless and most likely \nspared them significant adverse consequences in their advanced years.1  \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant was required to attend financial counseling in \nconjunction with filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He prepared a detailed budget and \ndemonstrates a firm grasp of budgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. He \nleads a modest lifestyle, lives within his means, and remains current on his present \nobligations. Furthermore, there is sufficient information to establish mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant has resolved his debts.2 I recognize that Applicant \nexplored his options to repay his creditors with his limited funds before filing \nbankruptcy. Applicant has also been current on his non-bankruptcy debts for \napproximately one year. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \nhis debts current. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating \ncondition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists 12 \ndebts approximating $26,000 that were at one time or another in various states of \ndelinquency. For several years, he failed to keep his accounts current showing \nfinancial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His lack of success resolving delinquent \ndebt until recently raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s 25-year record of employment working for a defense contractor weighs \nheavily in his favor. There is no evidence of any security violation during this lengthy \ntime. He is a law-abiding citizen. His debts are current and his SOR debts are \nresolved. Applicant did not seek Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a first course of action, but \nrather chose it as a \u201clast resort.\u201d His monthly expenses are current.  \n \nApplicant is making a significant contribution to the national defense. His \ncompany fully supports him and recommends him for a security clearance. He made \nmistakes, and debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to \ntrust him. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \npayments, having remained current on his monthly debts for one year. He also \nshowed considerable character helping his elderly parents at great personal expense \nto himself. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.m.: \n For Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

On February 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn May 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. DOHA\nreceived the request and the case was assigned to me on July 2, 2009. Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel agreed to an August 27, 2009, hearing date. On July 27, 2009, a\nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that date. The hearing was\nconvened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted seven exhibits (GE) 1-7,\nwithout objection. Applicant introduced one exhibit (AE) A, without objection. She\nOctober 22, 2009\n\n2\ntestified on her own behalf. I left the record open so that Applicant could submit\nadditional information. She submitted an additional packet which was marked as AE B,\nwithout objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 5, 2009. Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated May 1, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k of the SOR. She also admitted the factual allegations in\n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d of the SOR. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1992, and has attended college on a part-time basis since 2003.\nApplicant has a young child from a long-term relationship that ended in 2006. She has\nbeen with her current employer since September 2007 (Tr. 18).\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1992. Applicant served as a supply\ntechnician from 1998. She was in charge of ordering supplies for the base hospital. She\nwas the primary government credit card holder (Tr. 40). She made unauthorized\npersonal purchases while holding this position. She received a General Court-Martial on\nor about December 2001 (GE 5). Applicant was charged with: 1) Conspiracy to Commit\nLarceny (Article 81 of the UCMJ); 2) False Official Statements (Article 107 of the\nUCMJ); 3) Multiple Counts of Larceny (Article 121 of the UCMJ); and 4) Obtaining\nServices Under False Pretenses (Article 134 of the UCMJ). \nApplicant pled guilty to four charges involving larceny and signing a false\ndocument. She was represented by counsel (Tr. 34). She was sentenced to a reduction\nin grade of E1; forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement for 42 months and a\nBad Conduct Discharge. She was incarcerated from December 2001 until June 2003.\nShe received a sentence of 42 months but served only eighteen months. \nThe Final Order from the U.S. Army Criminal Court of Appeals confirmed her\nsentence, but remitted part of the confinement. In addition, the Army Clemency and\nParole Board suspended the Bad Conduct Discharge (GE 5).\nIn 2003, a short while after her release, Applicant began working as a waitress.\nShe ended this position due to a pregnancy in 2005. From February 2005 until July of\n2006, Applicant attended college courses full-time (Tr. 22). During that time she did not\nwork. \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts, including a voluntary repossession of a\nvehicle (GE 6, 7). She turned in her vehicle in 2001 due to the pending court martial (Tr.\n44). She realized that she would not be able to pay the monthly payment on the car.\nPrior to 2001, Applicant was current on her various accounts.  \n\n3\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: Applicant paid\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $67 in 2009 (GE 4). She settled the $90 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for\n$72. Applicant paid the $149 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j for $72. She settled the $742 debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.e for $226. Applicant settled the $1,098 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $450 (AE B).\nThese debts were paid in May 2009.\nApplicant recently contacted Cavalry for the involuntary repossession collection\naccount that totals approximately $4,286 (SOR\u00b6 1.c). She explained that she is trying to\narrange payments (Tr. 56). She also called Providian for the collection account debt of\n$1,773 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). She recalls that it may have been approximately six months ago\nthat they offered her a monthly payment plan, but she has not been able to make any\npayments to them. The last two debts in the SOR \u00b6 1.f (Plains) and \u00b6 1.i (Zenith) are\nboth for $506. Applicant believes they are duplicates. She has telephoned several\ncreditors but has not located the collection agent (Tr. 58). The SOR debt in \u00b6 1.g\n(Presidio) for $1,329 has also not been located.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $3,400. She receives a VA\ndisability of $581 monthly (Tr. 60). She has a car note for $450, but last year she co-\nsigned for another vehicle with the father of her child (Tr. 62). This car loan is for\napproximately $40,000. She is current with her monthly expenses of $2,700 (Tr. 75).\nShe is paying on other credit accounts for a monthly total of approximately $560. She\nhas a student loan in the amount of $2,250. Her net monthly remainder is approximately\n$200. Applicant has a retirement account in the amount of $2,500 and $600 in a savings\naccount (Tr. 76). Her mother lives nearby and helps her with food costs.\nApplicant has not attended financial counseling to help her with her delinquent\ndebts or manage her budget. She tried to obtain a consolidation loan in 2003, when she\nwas released from the Army, but she did not follow through on the plan (Tr.78).   \nIn response to Section 23 - Your Police Record, on her January 2008 security\nclearance application, Applicant did not disclose her 2001 General Court-Martial.\nSection 23(a) asks whether one has ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense and emphasizes this includes those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice\nand also asks in 23(e) if one has been subject to Court-Martial in the last seven years.\nIn response to Section 27 \u2013 Your Financial Delinquencies, on the same security\napplication, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and did not disclose her 2001 involuntary\nrepossession of her vehicle.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 28(a) concerning financial delinquencies in\nthe last seven years of over 180 days (GE 1). She also answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 28(b)\nconcerning financial delinquencies in the last seven years of over 90 days.\nOn November 20, 2008, Applicant answered DOHA interrogatories. She stated\nthat her 2001 larceny charge was dismissed and that she had been \u201ccleared.\u201d In 2009,\nin her answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that when she completed the SF-86 in\n\n4\n2008, she did not disclose her 2001 court-martial because she had ultimately received\nan honorable discharge in 2005. She also explained that she was told that the incident\nwould not appear on her record because she had been \u201ccleared.\u201d \nAt the hearing, Applicant said she \u201cperceived\u201d the question based on the\nfollowing facts. She was already investigated in a background check and nothing\nappeared (Tr. 80). She said the honorable discharge meant that all had been \u201cremitted\u201d.\nShe elaborated that she called the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2005 and\nwas told that hers was a unique situation and the person could not tell her how to\nanswer any questions about the court-martial and confinement (Tr. 80). She also called\nthe prosecuting attorney in her case, and she related that he could not tell her how to\nanswer the question either (Tr. 82). He told her he could not give her any advice.\nApplicant responded to questions at the hearing concerning her non-disclosure of\nthe 2001 court-martial in another manner also. She knew she pled guilty and served an\n18-month sentence but she believed that because it was not within the seven-year\nperiod, she did not have to disclose it (Tr. 95). She did not forget about the 2001 court-\nmartial but she chose not to disclose it. She did not disclose anything about the\nconviction with her employer (Tr. 97). She acknowledged at the hearing that even if she\nthought that she did not have to disclose the conviction due to a seven year time frame\nthat it was clearly within the seven years (Tr. 99). \nApplicant supervises three employees in her current position. She received a\npromotion in less than one year of employment. In her position, she manages more than\nfour million dollars of equipment for battalions that are in Iraq (AE A). \nApplicant is described by colleagues as personable with a positive attitude. Her\nsupervisor describes her as a strong leader, who is very responsible. She follows rules\nand regulations. She shows attention to detail. Applicant works long hours and is a\ngreat asset to the organization. She is a great friend, co-worker, full-time student,\nmother, and woman (AE B).\nThe prosecuting attorney in Applicant\u2019s 2001 Court-Martial case submitted a\nletter for Applicant and described her as honest and forthright during the investigation in\n2001. He elaborated that she served as a witness during the prosecution of a co-party\nto her case. He believes she has paid her debt to society and has significantly\ntransformed her life. He followed her progress and states she is a thoughtful and\nproductive citizen. He recommends her for a security clearance (AE B).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n6\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on several accounts for\nmany years. She voluntarily turned in her vehicle to a dealership in 2001, because she\ncould not make any payments. Her credit reports confirm the debts. Under AG \u00b6\n19(d),\u201ddeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft,\ncheck fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan\nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust: raises security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s Court-Martial in 2001 and subsequent conviction falls in this category. \u201cThe\nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the concern may be\nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant still has\nunresolved debts. She has no immediate plans to pay the unresolved debts. She co-\nsigned a car loan for $40,000 last year. This mitigating condition does not apply in this\ncase. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ I find this is not a factor\nfor consideration in this case. As noted above, she recently paid some small debts after\nreceiving the SOR in 2009. She did not act responsibly in paying her accounts.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling, but in 2003,\nshe attempted a loan consolidation, but she did not follow through. She still has\nunresolved debt. She paid or settled several accounts in 2009. She does not have a\nsufficient track record or an organized plan to resolve the remaining debts. Her efforts\nare insufficient to carry her burden in this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions\napply in part.\n\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed her 2008 security application, she did not\ndisclose her 2001 conviction for larceny in response to Section 23. She knew she pled\nguilty to the charges despite the fact that later she ultimately had part of the sentence\nremitted and received an honorable discharge. She asked advice and no one told her\nshe did not have to disclose the 2001 incident. She chose to do so because she\nbelieved it would not show up on her security clearance investigation. She also\nexplained that she thought she did not have to disclose the Court-Martial because it did\nnot fall within the seven-year time frame. However, she acknowledged at the hearing\nthat it is within the seven years. Applicant admitted in her answer to the SOR that she\ndeliberately did not disclose the 2001 Court-Martial in her 2008 security clearance\napplication. She also admitted that she falsified material facts with respect to the DOHA\ninterrogatories in 2008. I find she intentionally falsified her security clearance application\nby omitting her general Court-Martial conviction (\u00b6\u00b6 2. a and 2.b).\nApplicant knew she had returned her car in 2001 and had not made anymore\npayments. She was not sure until later that it was a voluntary repossession but she\nknew it was a repossession. She knew she had delinquent debts. She knew they were\non her credit reports. I find against her on the remaining allegations under personal\nconduct. After considering the mitigating conditions under this guideline, I find that none\nof them apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has worked for defense\ncontractors for several years. She is rated highly by her employers and her colleagues.\nShe is managing a responsible position. She is caring for her daughter as a single\nparent. She is attending college to gain better employment opportunities. She is paying\nsome of her bills. She is on the right track financially. She is highly regarded by her\ncolleagues and friends. \nApplicant was convicted of several charges relating to larceny while in the U.S.\nArmy in 2001. She served an 18-month sentence. She ultimately received an honorable\ndischarge in 2005. She did not disclose this information on her 2008 security clearance\napplication. She deliberately omitted this material information. She also did not disclose\nher financial situation. She recently co-signed a loan for $40,000 with her estranged\npartner. She will be legally responsible for this debt if he defaults. She still has\nsignificant unresolved delinquent debt of her own. I find this casts doubt on her\njudgment and reliability at this time.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 27-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor since October 2005. He has not previously held a clearance. Applicant has a recent history of excessive alcohol consumption, punctuated by two alcohol-related incidents. He began drinking alcohol in 2000, while he was in 2 college and not yet legal drinking age. He described his drinking pattern as 10 beers one weekend night from 2000 until his second DUI in July 2007. He acknowledges drinking and driving 3-4 times annually during this period. Indeed, he was arrested for DUI in February 2002, when he blew a .09 B.A.C. after a traffic stop in a state that prohibited a minor driver from driving with a B.A.C. over .02 (at the time the state DUI threshold was .10 B.A.C. for adult drivers). He had been to a party where he drank 4-5 beers over a 4-5 hour period. He thought he was competent to drive, but was stopped by officers for weaving in his lane. In July 2007, Applicant was arrested for a second DUI. He drank 9-10 beers over fewer than five hours, and was stopped by officers who observed him swerving over the center line with his high-beam lights on. He failed a field sobriety test (FST), blew a .13 B.A.C. at the scene, and registered .154 on a blood screen taken at the police station. The blood alcohol levels were nearly twice the state limit of .08, and fell into the state\u2019s high alcohol rate punishment category (.16 B.A.C. being designated highest ",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 6 November 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline G.  Applicant answered the SOR 29 November 2008, and requested a\n1\ndecision without hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 24 March 2009. The record in\nthis case closed 12 February 2009, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.\n \nMarch 30, 2009\n\nThe July 2004 conviction for furnishing alcohol to a minor has no security significance within the meaning of\n2\nGuideline G as it did not involve Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol. The known facts are that Applicant took\na six-pack of beer to a friend\u2019s party and contributed it to the beverage supply at the party. The next day, he\nwas arrested for furnishing alcohol to a minor. There is no evidence that Applicant knew there were minors\nat the party, but his lack of knowledge would not be a defense to the charge. If he had known there would be\nminors at the party, there might be some issue of poor judgment, but would rise to a security concern, if at all,\nunder Guideline E.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 27-year-old software engineer\nemployed by a defense contractor since October 2005. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\nApplicant has a recent history of excessive alcohol consumption, punctuated by\ntwo alcohol-related incidents.  He began drinking alcohol in 2000, while he was in\n2\ncollege and not yet legal drinking age. He described his drinking pattern as 10 beers\none weekend night from 2000 until his second DUI in July 2007. He acknowledges\ndrinking and driving 3-4 times annually during this period. Indeed, he was arrested for\nDUI in February 2002, when he blew a .09 B.A.C. after a traffic stop in a state that\nprohibited a minor driver from driving with a B.A.C. over .02 (at the time the state DUI\nthreshold was .10 B.A.C. for adult drivers). He had been to a party where he drank 4-5\nbeers over a 4-5 hour period. He thought he was competent to drive, but was stopped\nby officers for weaving in his lane.\nIn July 2007, Applicant was arrested for a second DUI. He drank 9-10 beers over\nfewer than five hours, and was stopped by officers who observed him swerving over the\ncenter line with his high-beam lights on. He failed a field sobriety test (FST), blew a .13\nB.A.C. at the scene, and registered .154 on a blood screen taken at the police station.\nThe blood alcohol levels were nearly twice the state limit of .08, and fell into the state\u2019s\nhigh alcohol rate punishment category (.16 B.A.C. being designated highest rate). At his\nNovember 2007 trial, his license was suspended to November 2008, he received six-\nmonths supervised probation, and ordered to undergo an alcohol evaluation. Applicant\nclaims, without corroboration, that he was not recommended for further counseling or\ntreatment. He also claims, without corroboration to have consumed no alcohol since\nDecember 2007, and to have not consumed to excess since his July 2007 DUI. The\ngovernment documented that Applicant completed his probation requirements and was\nreleased from supervision in May 2008. The record contains no employment or\ncharacter references.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b622.(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n4\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; . . . (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n3\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline G,\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s seven-year history of alcohol abuse punctuated by alcohol-\nrelated arrests in February 2002 and July 2007.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol pattern from 2000\n4\nto at least July 2007 is fairly described as binge consumption. He also consumed\nalcohol and drove on multiple occasions in those seven years, and is fortunate to have\nbeen stopped only twice. In addition, his alcohol abuse continued after college into his\nworking career.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Although he has not had any\nrecurrence of alcohol-related arrests since July 2007, he had the incentives of\nsupervised probation until May 2008 and potential restoration of his drivers license in\nNovember 2008. It is too soon to tell if he will resume drinking or drinking to excess.\nFurther, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions under Guideline G. His\n\n\u00b623.(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\n5\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b623.(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\n6\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent)\nor responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\u00b623.(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has\n7\nno history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress;\n\u00b623.(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along\n8\nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, . . . and has received a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\n4\nalcohol abuse was recent, frequent, and not under unusual circumstances.  The record\n5\ncontains no evidence of changed circumstances or insights that would augur well for\nApplicant to maintain his sobriety. On this record, Applicant is unable to establish either\na pattern of abstinence or responsible use given his recent release from probationary\nstatus, and more recent restoration of driving privileges.  While he has not been\n6\ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser, neither does he have any\ncorroboration that he was not found to require a counseling program after the evaluation\nordered as a result of his July 2007 DUI.  Finally, Applicant lacks the kind of program,\n7\ntrack record, and prognosis that would demonstrate that his alcohol problems are\nbehind him.  I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future. In\n8\nessence, the government established its security concerns and Applicant failed his\nburden of producing positive information, distinct from the absence of negative\ninformation to establish rehabilitation. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline G against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Appellant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about December 18, 2008, and requested a \nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 27, 2009, and issued a Notice of \nJune 23, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nHearing on April 28, 2009. The case was heard on May 12, 2009, as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified. He offered Exhibits (AE) A and B into evidence \nwithout objection from the Government. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record \nopen until May 28, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted exhibits that I marked as AE C through E and \nadmitted into the record without objection from the Government.

His admissions are incorporated into the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and married for the second time. He and his wife have \n6-year-old twins. In 1978, he graduated from college and was commissioned in the \nNavy. He served seven years of active duty before resigning and joining the reserves in \n1985. He worked as a stock broker until 1989 when he decided to return to school for a \nMaster\u2019s degree in History. In 1991, he completed the degree and started teaching. He \nthen began work on his Ph.D.  From 1995 through 1996, he was on active duty. In July \n1999 through December 2000, he returned to active duty. He worked for the IRS from \nMay 2001 until September 11, 2001, at which time he was recalled to active duty. He \nwas subsequently deployed overseas for seven months. He held a Top Secret security \nclearance while in the Navy.  \n \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant was released from active duty and began working \nfor a friend\u2019s medical billing company. In June 2003, he was recalled to active duty \nagain and served until January 2004. In February 2004, he resumed work with the \nbilling company until October 2007, when he applied for a government position as an \nArmy historian. In May 2008, he retired from the Navy as a Captain with an honorable \ndischarge. (GE 2) \n \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to several factors, beginning with the \nbirth of his twins in March 2003 and medical bills that began accruing due to their \nprematurity. Prior to their birth, his wife worked but discontinued after they were born. \nWhile on active duty from June 2003 to January 2004, he maintained an apartment for \nhis family in another state, in addition to their house in their home state, which created \nduplicate housing expenses. When he returned to the billing company in early 2004, he \nearned $30,000 to $36,000. He admitted that some of his financial problems were the \nresult of poor financial management and overspending. (Tr. 28)  \n \n \nBefore his twins were born, Applicant was earning about $65,000, had about \n$24,000 in savings and $12,000 in credit card debt. By the end of December 2003, he \nhad about $14,000 in savings and $38,000 in credit card debt. (Tr. 28) At the end of \n2004, he had $9,000 in savings, almost $50,000 in credit card debt and was earning a \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n$36,000 salary. In early 2005, his salary increased to $48,000 with a promise of a \n$10,000 raise in the near future. By summer of 2006, his student loans became \ndelinquent, resulting in a garnishment, and his finances \u201cbottomed out.\u201d (Tr. 36) He \nsubsequently moved into a home that his parents owned. In the fall of 2006, his salary \nincreased to $60,000 and his wife returned to teaching part-time with an annual income \nof $19,000. (Tr. 30-34) In the following fall of 2007, he started his current position, \nearning $70,000. He and his wife have ceased using credit cards and live on their \nsalaries. (Tr. 53) He believes his financial condition is improving. (Tr. 37) \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant submitted an e-QIP to the Government, notifying it of \nhis delinquent debts. In July 2008, he completed Interrogatories related to his numerous \nfinancial delinquencies. He noted that he was establishing hardship payment plans with \nseveral creditors.   \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated October 24, 2007 and September \n2008, the SOR alleged nine debts, totaling $112,9581 that started becoming delinquent \nin 2006 or earlier. The status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $301 medical debt. He has been paying $25 per month \nfor several months. The balance is $100. (Tr. 39)  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $13,116 debt owed to a credit card company. He spoke \nto the creditor but has not made any payments on the debt because the \ncompany will not establish a small monthly repayment schedule. (Tr. 43)  \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $28,459 debt owed to a credit card company. He made \none payment within the last six months. (Tr. 43) \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $6,068 debt owed to a credit card company. Since April \n2009, he has been paying $100 a month. (Tr. 43; AE A )  \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $26,824 debt owed to a credit card company. He \nrecently spoke to the creditor, who is unwilling to negotiate a small monthly \npayment. (Tr. 45)  \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $13,377 debt owed to a credit card company. He has \nbeen paying $125 per month. The balance is $12,000.  (Tr. 46; AE A) \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $10,097 debt owed to a credit card company. He is \npaying $100 per month. It is the same debt as listed in \u00b6 1.h. (Tr. 46; AE A, E; \nAnswer) \n \n \n                                            \n1SOR \u00b6 1.g and \u00b6 1.h are duplicate debts, reducing the total amount of the delinquent debts listed \nin the SOR to $103,626.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a $9,332 debt owed to the above referenced credit card \ncompany. (Tr. 47; Answer) \n \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a $5,384 debt owed to a credit card company. He is paying \n$54.95 per month. The balance is $5,700. (Tr. 47-48; AE B) \n  \n \nIn summary, Applicant is making minimal payments of $405 on six of the eight \nlisted debts that total $103,626. He began making some of those payments about six or \neight months ago. In addition to the above, Applicant and his wife have a combined \nstudent loan debt of about $200,000. The loans went into default status in November \n2007. In the summer of 2008, Applicant began a rehabilitation program for the loans \nand they are now current. He has also paid off many medical bills, as well as other bills. \n(Tr. 36; GE 2 at 7)  \n \n  \n \nAs of July 2008, Applicant\u2019s net monthly income was $5,337, and includes \n$1,211 from his wife\u2019s teaching position. His monthly expenses are $2,980 and \npayments on debts total $2,380, leaving a $22 monthly deficit. (GE 2) At this time, he \npays more than one-third of his monthly income for debt reduction. (Tr. 45) He believes \nthat he owes about $110,000 in credit card debt and $200,000 in student loans. (Tr. 48-\n49)  He anticipates that he will need ten to twelve years to pay off his credit card debt \nand twenty-five to thirty years to pay the student loans. (Tr. 57)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he and his wife did not establish a budget when these \nfinancial difficulties started developing in 2003. (Tr. 58) Recently, he developed a \nspreadsheet for his bills, but not a budget. (Tr. 59) He has not participated in any form \nof credit counseling because he was told by military people that such actions could \nnegatively affect one\u2019s security clearance. (Tr. 37) \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly about the reasons underlying his financial \ndelinquencies. He accepts responsibility for the decisions he has made over the years \nand the obligations that he has incurred.  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the Financial Considerations guideline is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmaybe be disqualifying in this case:  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative case flow, high debt-to \nincome ratio, and other issues of security concern. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt in late \n2003, which he has been unable or unwilling to address until the summer of 2008. A \nlarge portion of the debt is attributable to excessive credit card spending. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these three potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those three \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply because Applicant\u2019s numerous financial problems have \nbeen ongoing since late 2003 and continue into 2009. Some of Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are attributable to his twins\u2019 medical problems, low salaries while working for a \nprivate company, and one period of active duty during which he had additional housing \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nexpenses. Those conditions were \u201cbeyond his control.\u201d However, there is no evidence \nthat he took adequate steps to manage his obligations or control his spending while he \nexperienced financial difficulties. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application. He has not \nsought credit counseling to-date, established a firm budget nor presented sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that there are \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved\u201d \nto warrant the application of AG \u00b6 20(c). He has been making minimal payments on six \nof the eight debts since last summer, one of which has a $100 balance. He has \nunsuccessfully attempted to address the remaining two. His action is some evidence of \na good-faith effort to \u201crepay or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and triggers a very limited \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d). The record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 \n20(e) or AG \u00b6 20(f). \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature 53-year-old \nman, who is highly educated and retired from the Navy after honorably serving our \ncountry. He has experienced a series of events that have contributed to some of his \nfinancial problems. He is candid and embarrassed by his indebtedness and intends to \ncontinue resolving it in the future. However, what is troubling is the magnitude of the \ndebt that has been ongoing for several years. He has voluntarily accrued over $110,000 \nin credit card debt and $200,000 in student loans. While he is taking small steps to \nmanage the problem, he has not sought professional help or established a detailed firm \nbudget with his wife to resolve the problem.  His behavior in accumulating and resolving \nthe debt raises questions about his judgment. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under \nfinancial considerations.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\n1\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On\nNovember 7, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nMay 8, 2009\n\n The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfacts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 23, 2009, and I convened a hearing on April 1, 2009. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5)\nincluded in the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted five exhibits\n(Ax. A - E) admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on\nApril 10, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $5,075\nfor delinquent payments on a timeshare (SOR\u00b6 1.a); that he owes approximately\n$22,171 for unpaid state taxes being enforced through a lien against him (SOR \u00b6 1.b);\nthat he has not filed his state income tax returns as required for tax years 2002 through\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that he owes $33 for a delinquent cell phone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In\nresponse, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts\nestablished through Applicant\u2019s admissions, after reviewing the pleadings, the\ntranscript, and the parties\u2019 exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old and works as a senior systems analyst for a large\ndefense contractor. He served in the United States Air Force from December 1976 until\nSeptember 1985. He has been steadily employed for most of his adult life and has lived\nin the same house since 1996. Applicant has held a security clearance through his\nmilitary service and in connection with several defense contractor positions since about\n1982. (Gx. 1) \nApplicant was married from August 1978 until November 2007. He and his ex-\nwife actually separated in 2005. The marriage produced four children, one of whom, a\n10-year-old, is still their dependent. (Gx. 1) When he and his wife separated, they\nagreed to a division of assets and liabilities. In relevant part, they agreed Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife would make the $150 monthly payments on a timeshare they had purchased in\n2004 for $7,000. Sometime in 2005, she stopped making the payments. In 2006,\nApplicant became aware that payments on the timeshare were delinquent, but he did\nnot attempt to resolve the past due payments. After receiving interrogatories from\nDOHA adjudicators in May 2008, Applicant called the creditor and was told the\ntimeshare had been sold back to the timeshare company in February 2008. It is\nApplicant\u2019s understanding that he has no continuing obligation for this debt. (Gx. 2; Tr.\n33 - 34, 38 - 39, 55 - 56)\nApplicant did not file his state tax returns on time for the 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,\nand 2006 tax years. He also owes the state approximately $22,171 for unpaid taxes,\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nostensibly for the same tax years. Applicant repeatedly stated that he has no excuse for\nnot filing his taxes as required and that his actions were simply the result of\nprocrastination. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 32, 50) Applicant also has relied on his belief that\nwhen his returns are all filed, the state will see he was owed a refund for each year and\nthe tax lien will either be cancelled or will be greatly reduced. (Tr. 32 - 33) He bases this\nbelief on conversations with friends and acquaintances with backgrounds in tax issues.\nHe has not, however, formally consulted an accountant or a professional tax advisor.\n(Tr. 51 - 52)\nApplicant first became aware of a tax lien against him in 2005, but has yet to\nmake any payments on that obligation. He twice tried without success in 2006 and 2007\nto contact someone in the cognizant state tax agency to discuss his situation. In\nDecember 2008, he was able to speak with someone there who told him how to file his\npast due tax returns. Between January and March 2009, he filed his 2003 - 2006\nreturns. He is still trying to file his 2002 return, but had to request a copy of his 2002\nfederal return before he could do so. As of the hearing, he had not yet received it. (Ax. A\n- D; Tr. 26 - 28, 35 - 36) Applicant was also late in filing his 2007 federal and state\nreturns. (Ax. E; Tr. 42 - 43, 46) He has also been advised that his tax account has been\ncredited $4,200 based on the returns he has filed so far, but that a final accounting will\nnot be done until all of his returns are filed. (Tr. 52 - 54)\nAll of Applicant\u2019s other financial obligations are current and there is no indication\nhe has any other financial problems. However, his cash flow each month is only about\n$48 after expenses, and he likely would have to use personal credit to repay whatever\nremains of the tax lien against him. To his credit, he has paid off the delinquent cell\nphone bill listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Gx. 2; Tr. 34, 48 - 50)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a - 1,d; that is, that Applicant was at least partially responsible for a $5,075\ndebt on a repossessed timeshare and that he owes $22,171 for a state tax lien. The\n\n See footnote 7, supra. \n8\n5\ngovernment\u2019s information also showed that Applicant failed to file his state tax returns\nas required between 2002 and 2006. At hearing, it was further established that he was\nlate in filing his state and federal returns for 2007. Finally, it was also established that\nApplicant owed $33 for a delinquent cell phone account. He has paid the cell phone bill\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). It also may be reasonable to conclude that he is under no continuing\nobligation in connection with the timeshare (SOR \u00b6 1.a). However, Applicant has only\nrecently begun to take steps to resolve his tax obligations, despite being aware of the\ntax lien since 2005 and despite being asked about his tax filing status at least twice\nduring his background investigation. The fact he disclosed his non-filing when he\nsubmitted his e-QIP shows he was aware more than 18 months ago that he was\ndelinquent on his tax reporting obligations. The foregoing requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file\nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of\nthe same).\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s information showed that he has filed\nmost of the tax returns at issue, but that he only acted to do so after being issued the\nSOR. He also admitted being late on his 2007 returns and cannot show that the lien\nagainst him will be resolved once his delinquent fillings are submitted. Available\ninformation does not support application of any of the mitigating conditions listed under\nAG \u00b6 20. To the contrary, the information presented shows that Applicant still suffers\nfrom the same procrastination that caused his difficulties. While he is otherwise\nfinancially current, it will be difficult for him to pay the tax lien against him should there\nbe no significant reduction in that obligation after his returns are filed. On balance, he\nhas not mitigated the security concerns about his finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Available information portrays\nApplicant as a mature and, save for his failure to file his taxes, responsible 51-year-old\ndefense contractor employee. He has been steadily employed since 1976 in both the\nmilitary and the private sectors. At his hearing, he was credible in his testimony and\ntook full responsibility for his actions. However, at this time, a fair and commonsense\nevaluation of this record shows that the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s failure to\nmeet his tax obligations and the resulting financial problems have not been mitigated.\nAccordingly, doubts remain as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Because\nprotection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts\nmust be resolved in favor of the government.8\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for continued access to classified information. Request for\nsecurity clearance is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: William F. Savarino, Attorney At Law\nDecember 15, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated May 19, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On April 14, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 4, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on\nJune 22, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 13, 2009, and the matter was\nscheduled for hearing on August 18, 2009.  The Government presented five exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nThe Applicant presented three exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C,\nwhich were received without objection. The Applicant called two witnesses and testified\non his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 25,\n\n2\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 36 years old, single, and has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in\nBioengineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.  \nThe Applicant has an extensive history of criminal conduct and poor personal\nconduct, which includes a pattern of thefts and numerous other incidents of\nquestionable judgment and dishonesty described below.  He graduated from high\nschool in 1991, and from college in 1996.  He became a partner at a defense\ncontracting firm in July 2004.  He  received his Secret level security clearance in 1997,\nand a Top Secret clearance in 2002.  During his application process for SCI access, he\nwas required to take a polygraph examination.  It was during the polygraph examination\nprocess that the information below was revealed.  In May 2007, Applicant was denied\nhis SCI access.  \nIn 1991, the Applicant was employed at a movie theater.  During the course his\nemployment, he and a coworker found different ways to steal from their employer.  Over\nthe course of a year, the Applicant stole six credit cards from wallets accidentally left by\ncustomers at the theater and illegally used the credit cards to make purchases.  He\ncharged between $500.00 - $1,000.00 on each credit card over a month period before\nthe card was cancelled by the owner.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).\nWhile working at the movie theater, in 1991, the Applicant obtained the\ncombination of one of the theater\u2019s safes, and on two separate occasions stole\napproximately $2,500.00.  Over a four to six month period in 1991, the Applicant also\nstole approximately $40.00 a week from his employer through various illegal activities\nsuch as \u201cshort changing\u201d the customer, changing ticket sales and over-charging\nconcession stand items.  The Applicant also, about ten times, stole $20.00 from a\nsponsored charity, which were contributions donated by customers to the employer for\nthe charity.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).  Applicant acknowledged that as a result\nof his thefts, his employer could not determine who was stealing so the entire staff was\nterminated.  (Tr. pp. 132-133).  \n\n3\nBetween 1985 and 1991, while in junior high school and high school, the\nApplicant engaged in petty shoplifting of items such as candy, magazines, and comic\nbooks from liquor stores, drug stores and comic book stores.  In his own words, \u201cI stole\na lot of things.\u201d  (Tr. p. 132).  The Applicant explained that at the time he committed the\nthefts, he wanted to make some extra money and knew he would not get caught.  (Tr. p.\n85).  \nFrom 1990 to 1993, the Applicant used false identification to purchase alcohol\nwhile underage, and on at least one occasion used the false identification to verify\npurchases he made with stolen credit cards.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).\nIn 1994-95, while in college and working as a student aide on a United States\nmilitary installation, (in the excess inventory department), the Applicant noticed lots of\nexcess computer equipment, that included mice, keyboards, old computer parts, and old\ncomputers.  (Tr. p. 92).  A report of the Applicant\u2019s interview dated August 21, 2006,\nindicates that the Applicant stole numerous and various Government owned computer\nparts over a thirteen year period.  (Government Exhibit 2).  Applicant contends that he\nstole one of the laptops, and used it for his personal use, mainly for school work, since\nhe did not have a computer.  (Tr. p. 94).  He claims that there was a proper procedure\nthat could have allowed him to legally take the laptop, but he failed to follow those\nprocedures.  Applicant claims that he stole only one time from this employer and that\nthe investigator misunderstood him during the interview.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3 and\n4).  \nIn the summer of 2005, while gambling at a casino, the Applicant won a\nsignificant amount of $6,800, in a poker tournament.  Applicant states that the cashier\ntold him that he had no tax withholdings.  Despite this, he states that he knew it was\ntaxable income.  (Tr. p. 104-105).  He failed to claim or report the $6,800.00 of poker\nwinnings on his 2005 income tax return.  In early 2006, he again won a poker\ntournament and a significant amount of money.  This time he won $4,000.  Again, he\nfailed to claim or report this $4,000.00 of poker winnings on his 2006 income tax return.\nIn the summer of 2007, the Applicant hired a tax preparer to clean up his tax issues.\n(Tr. p. 107 and Government Exhibits 4 and 5).  Nothing was done until late 2008 or\nearly 2009.  Applicant was required to pay additional taxes that he has paid.  (Tr. p. 109\nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B). \nDuring the period from 2003 to 2005, the Applicant explained that he was\naccessing computer files on a peer to peer network (allowing free access to files without\ngoing through a central server) at home.  He downloaded numerous (not to exceed 10)\nsexually explicit videos some of which were underaged females engaging in intercourse\nand fellatio.  Applicant explained that he believed some of the females in the video were\nunderaged because they did not appear fully developed or like other pornography he\nhad seen in the past.  The Applicant suggested that the females in the videos might be\nbetween the ages of 13 and 18 and that the titles of some of the videos he downloaded\nwere described as \u201cunderaged\u201d.  While watching the videos, on numerous occasions\nthe Applicant masturbated to the underaged females sexual intercourse and fellatio.\n(Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).  Applicant saved the underaged videos on the hard\ndrive of his computer for between two and four months, and then deleted the videos\nbecause he was afraid he would get into trouble if he were found with the videos in his\n\n4\npossession.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 4).  Applicant explained that during the course\nof this conduct, he was very careful to make sure that nobody could get into his system. \n(Tr. P. 117).  \nApplicant now denies that any of the titles had the name \u201cunderaged\u201d in them.\n(Tr. p. 113).  He claims that he was not sure that the females were underaged. He also\ncontends that he masturbated only to the adult pornography he downloaded, and not to\nthe underaged female pornography.  (Tr. p. 116).  Applicant believes the investigator\nmay have misunderstood him or there was some mistake on the Applicant\u2019s part.   \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  One of them has known the\nApplicant since junior high school, over twenty years, and works in the IT Department at\na major university, the other is the President and Facility Security Officer of the\nEngineering consulting firm the Applicant currently works for.  Both individuals consider\nthe Applicant to be highly trustworthy and responsible, and recommend him for a\nposition of trust.  (Tr. pp.  25-34 and 46-58). \nLetters of recommendation from program managers and systems engineer, one\nof whom has known the Applicant for as much as seven years, and all of whom have\nknown him for at least four years, in a mixture of both professional environment at work\nand in social situations, consider the Applicant to be trustworthy, diligent, dedicated,\ndependable, professional, mature, reliable and ethical.  He is said to have always\nproperly protected sensitive, classified and proprietary information.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC).\nThe Applicant realizes his mistakes of the past.  He is remorseful, humiliated and\nembarrassed by his conduct.\n    \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality,\nrelease of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information;\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or\nresources.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n17.(c) The offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n17.(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\n\n6\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n17.(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n7\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct and personal conduct that demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), and dishonesty and poor\njudgment (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J and E of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  I have also considered mitigation conditions 32.(a) so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and 32.(d) there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.  Arguably some of the\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and questionable judgment occurred many years ago, but\nviewed in total, it demonstrates a pattern of misconduct that has continued over an\nextended period and last occurred as recently as 2006, when he intentionally\nunderstated his income to avoid taxes.  Stealing from his employer, its customers and a\ncharity, stealing a laptop computer and possibly more from the Government, shoplifting\non numerous occasions, and viewing underaged pornography on his home computer\ncasts serious doubt on the Applicant\u2019s character.  Additionally, the Applicant has not\nbeen candid or upfront with the Government.  Many of the facts that he provided the\ninvestigator during his earlier interviews, he retracted at the hearing, and now believes\nthe investigator misunderstood.  I do not find this argument persuasive.  Possibly\n\n8\nbrought on by embarrassment, but obviously no excuse, I find that the Applicant has not\nbeen entirely credible or candid. \n      \nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct disqualifying condition\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive\ncorporate or other government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other\ninappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations,\nand (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or\nresources applies.  I have considered mitigating conditions 17.(c) The offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, 17.(d) the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur and 17.(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, but they are not compelling.  The\noffenses committed by the Applicant over the years are not minor, he has received no\ncounseling for his behavior, and in fact he has done little other than apologize for his\ngreed.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance\nholders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes if an Applicant has a\npattern of misconduct that demonstrates serious unreliability, such as is true with this\nApplicant.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.     \nGiven his extensive criminal history, and his numerous incidents of questionable\njudgment, the most recent which occurred just three years ago, in 2006, the Applicant\nclearly does not meet the qualifications of an individual that can be trusted with the\nnational secrets.  Assuming that he now realizes his childish, immature and criminal\nbehavior can no longer continue, more time is needed to ensure the Government that\nthe Applicant will not revert to his old ways.  Furthermore, the Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility requirements for\naccess to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). \n\n9\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action\nis based on Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems or difficulties (delinquent debts),\nwhich Applicant has yet to begin to address. The record contains insufficient evidence\nto explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from her history of\nfinancial problems, which are ongoing and unresolved. Accordingly, as explained in\nmore detail below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nSeptember 2, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Tr. 7\u20139. \n2\n Exhibits 4 and 5. \n3\n Exhibit 5 (some of these accounts appear to be duplicates).\n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on March 11, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 1, 2009, and she requested a hearing.  The\n2\ncase was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJuly 15, 2009. The testimony of Applicant was taken, and Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 6 were admitted. Applicant called no witnesses and offered no documentary\nevidence. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received July 23, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged 41 delinquent debts for a total of about $32,000. In reply to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted 16 of the 41 delinquent debts for a total of about $19,000.\nBased on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old aircraft mechanic. She has been continuously\nemployed by the same company since 1997. She is married and has two daughters,\nages 12 and 6. Her husband works in the auto business (both sales and mechanics),\nand he has been unemployed for the last two months due to a business downturn.\nApplicant is seeking to retain a clearance previously granted to her. \nCredit reports from 2008 establish (1) the debts alleged in the SOR, and (2) that\nApplicant has a history of financial problems.  For example, the trade section of the\n3\nMarch 2008 credit report has 102 accounts of which 62 are described as derogatory in\nsome way (in collection, past due, etc.).

She admitted that she had no documentation to show she was not\n5\nresponsible for the debts she denied.  Likewise, she admitted that she took no steps to\n6\naddress the debts after receiving the SOR.  Applicant has not made any payments on\n7\nthe debts she admitted.  Her general plan, which is yet to be implemented, is that she\n8\nintends to pay her creditors when she has extra money starting with the smallest debt.9\nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant is about two months behind on her\n$521 monthly car loan.  Her husband\u2019s car, a 1999 Jaguar, is paid off.  Also, Applicant\n10\n11\nis indebted to the IRS for back taxes for tax years 2005 and 2007, and she is making\nmonthly payments per a repayment agreement with the IRS.  And Applicant is repaying\n12\na loan she took against her 401(k) account; this is the fourth such loan against the\naccount.13\nApplicant has little money in the bank.  She described how she and her husband\n14\nhandle their money as \u201cstrangely.\u201d  He is somewhat aware of her financial situation, but\n15\nshe is unaware of his financial situation.16\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n26\n4\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n17\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n18\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n19\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n20\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n21\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n22\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n23\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n24\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n27\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n28\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n29\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n30\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n31\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(e). \n32\n5\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n27\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n28\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n29\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems raises concerns because it indicates\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n30\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. Also, Applicant\u2019s multiple accounts and\n31\nexcessive indebtedness establish a pattern of consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans.  The record establishes that Applicant has delinquent debts in excess of\n32\n$30,000, and she has no means to address the debts in a meaningful way. These facts\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n33\n6\nand circumstances are more than sufficient to establish the three disqualifying\nconditions noted above, and it suggests financial irresponsibility as well.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns as follows:  \n33\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nThe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;\nThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\nThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nThe affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply to mitigate\nand overcome the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not minor, and\nthey are ongoing and unresolved. And she is yet to implement a realistic plan to\naddress her indebtedness. Given these circumstances, it is too soon to tell if Applicant\nwill resolve her outstanding delinquent debts in a reasonable time and then continue to\nbe a financially responsible person. The likelihood of additional or continuing financial\nproblems cannot be ruled out. Indeed, Applicant (1) is now two months past due on an\nauto loan, (2) owes the IRS back taxes for two tax years, and (3) is now repaying her\nfourth loan against her 401(k) account. These facts, when combined with the SOR\nindebtedness, show that her overall financial situation is unstable and headed toward\ncollapse or bankruptcy or both. These circumstances are plainly contrary to the clearly-\nconsistent standard I am required to apply. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n34\n7\nApplicant. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-factor whole-\nperson concept.34\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet her ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.oo:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.      \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 30,\n2008, Applicant submitted a response to the SOR. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on December 15, 2008. A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 12, 2009. The hearing was\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMay 21, 2009\n\n Applicant did not object to administrative notice being taken of the documents, but he did partially\n2\ndispute the information contained in some of those documents. The matters he disputed have no bearing on\nmy decision in this case.\n2\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted 7 documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7. GE 1 and 2 were admitted into the record\nwithout objection. Administrative notice was taken of the contents of GE 3-7 without\nobjection.  Department Counsel submitted a document containing written comments on the\n2\ncontents of GE 3-7 for my consideration which was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.)\nI and made part of the record without objection. Applicant testified, called one witness to\ntestify on his behalf, and submitted nine documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1-9 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript\nwas received on February 26, 2009.    \nDuring the course of the hearing, substantial evidence was introduced concerning\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with persons in Ukraine. Department Counsel moved to amend the\nSOR to allege additional Guideline B concerns based on Applicant\u2019s Ukrainian\nconnections. I directed Department Counsel to file a written motion to amend the SOR,\nserve the motion upon Applicant, and I thereafter continued the hearing to a date to be\ndetermined to afford Applicant the opportunity to respond to the new allegations.\nDepartment Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons on\nFebruary 20, 2009. Applicant filed an undated response to the motion to amend in which\nhe admitted all allegations contained therein. A notice of hearing was thereafter issued on\nMarch 10, 2009, scheduling the continuation of the hearing for March 18, 2009. The\ncontinued hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted four\ndocuments at the continued hearing that were marked as GE 8-11 and admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Department Counsel submitted a document containing written\ncomments on the contents of GE 8-11 for my consideration which was marked as App. Ex.\nIV and made part of the record without objection. Applicant testified at the continued\nhearing but did not submit any additional documentary evidence. The transcript of the\ncontinued hearing was received on March 25, 2009.  \nProcedural Matters\nApplicant submitted written objections to various portions of the transcript of the\noriginal hearing (App. Ex. II). Department Counsel\u2019s and my recollection of the testimony\nprovided at that hearing were consistent with Applicant\u2019s objections. Accordingly, the\ntranscript was amended to conform to our collective memory of the testimony. Applicant\nsubmitted additional objections to two portions of the continued hearing (App. Ex. V). His\nrecollection of the testimony being consistent with mine, and without objection from\nDepartment Counsel, his objections are granted. The continued hearing was held at a\ndifferent location from the original hearing to accommodate Applicant (App. Ex. III). \n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR and the motion to amend the\nSOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings,\ntestimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old single man who has been employed as a linguist by a\ndefense contractor since May 2007. He was born and raised in Iraq. He resided in Iraq until\nhe deserted from the Iraqi Army in or about 1991. He thereafter resided as a refugee in\nSaudi Arabia until he was granted political asylum in the United States in August 1993.\nApplicant became a naturalized United States citizen in December 1999. He has\npossessed a U.S. passport since January 2000.\nApplicant\u2019s family is of Kurdish decent. He and his family were persecuted by the\nSaddam Hussein government throughout his life in Iraq. Applicant was prohibited from\npursuing a college education and instead had to attend a technical institute from which he\nreceived a diploma in general mechanics in June 1990. Applicant\u2019s father was forced to\nwatch as Applicant\u2019s brother was executed by the Hussein government in 1986. Applicant\nwas required to serve on the Iraqi border with Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War where\nhe was threatened by his commanding officer with execution and forced to drive north\nalong a highway on which death was all but imminent.\nApplicant and another Iraqi soldier deserted from the Iraqi Army rather than make\nthe drive on the \u201cHighway of Death\u201d as ordered. He then hid out in Iraq for a period of time,\nbriefly engaged in insurgent action against Iraqi forces, and eventually surrendered to\nUnited States military forces. He was turned over to Saudi Arabia where he remained in\na refugee status until he was granted entry into the United States. \nApplicant has worked at a variety of jobs since his entry into the United States,\nincluding work as a machine operator, production worker and warehouse worker. He also\nexperienced several periods of unemployment. Applicant began working in or about\nFebruary 2006 as an interpreter for a defense contractor other than his current employer.\nHe left that employ over a dispute concerning payments he had been promised upon\naccepting employment. He has rented a room in the same house in the city where he has\nresided since 1996.\nApplicant served with U. S. Army Special Forces commands in Iraq from about\nFebruary 2006 until April 2007. While serving in Iraq, Applicant was frequently required to\nperform his duties while receiving hostile fire. A U. S. Army captain reports that Applicant\nperformed his duties in a dedicated and diligent fashion during the course of at least six\nhostile attacks. Two U. S. Army majors describe Applicant as being honest and a hard\nworker. They both considered him to be a critical asset to their mission success. His\npresent employer attests to Applicant\u2019s professionalism, honesty and commitment.\nApplicant has volunteered his time and service to training National Guardsmen who are\nscheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. Applicant on occasion had access\nto classified information while serving in Iraq and there is no indication he ever did anything\nto risk compromise of that information.\n\n4\nApplicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. His youngest sister\nis 43 years old, a teacher, married, and has three children. Applicant has not spoken with\nher since he left Iraq in or about 1991. His older sister is 44 years old, a teacher, married,\nand has four children. Applicant used to contact her by telephone through her neighbor.\nHowever, he has not spoken with her since 2004. Applicant\u2019s father is alleged to be a\ncitizen and resident of Iraq. Although Applicant admitted this allegation, he testified he\ndoesn\u2019t know if his father is still alive. When Applicant last spoke with his sister in 2004,\nshe informed him that their father was gravely ill as a result of him having suffered a stroke.\nApplicant attempted to speak with his father over the telephone at that time but his father\nwas unable to respond. Applicant sent about $1,500 to his father on four occasions, the\nlast time being in either 1998 or 1999.\nApplicant made no effort to contact his father or sisters while he was serving with\nthe U. S. Army in Iraq because of concern for their safety if he did try to contact them.\nWhile he still professes familial concern and affection for his sisters and father, he has no\nplans to visit or contact them in the future unless and until the political climate improves to\na point where such visit and/or other contact would not jeopardize their safety.\nApplicant began searching for a wife outside the United States in or about 2002. He\nfirst traveled to Jordan on such a quest in 2002. Since that time, his focus has been on\nUkrainian women because of his preference for blond women who are apparently prevalent\nin that country and to his liking. He has engaged the services of marriage agencies and\nhas corresponded through internet sites in an effort to find a Ukrainian woman to marry.\nApplicant met one Ukrainian woman while she was in the United States who has\nsince returned to Ukraine. They are not presently romantically involved, but he remains\nfriends with her and has visited with her during some of his travels to Ukraine. Applicant\nmet another Ukrainian woman while he was in Ukraine and eventually became involved in\na romantic relationship with her. Although they are no longer romantically involved, they\nremain friends and Applicant has visited with her while on trips to Ukraine. Applicant has\nalso used the services of Ukrainian prostitutes during his visits in that country. He asserts\nhe has only partaken of the prostitutes in a very professional manner and that such\nconduct is fully acceptable to men from his heritage.\nApplicant met yet another Ukrainian woman over the internet in or about August\n2008. He traveled to Ukraine and spent three weeks there to meet with her in December\n2008. They stayed for part of the trip with her parents. They also traveled to the United\nArab Emirates for several days during this trip. During this trip, they agreed to marry. In\nJanuary 2009, Applicant applied for a fianc\u00e9 visa to allow her to immigrate to the United\nStates. He visited with her again in Ukraine for two weeks in February 2009. Applicant\nanticipates she will be permitted entry into the United States in or about August 2009. They\nintend to marry as soon as she enters the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is 24 years old. She is an only child and has resided with her\nparents her entire life. She completed a five-year course of study in psychology in Ukraine,\nbut has been studying cosmetology at Applicant\u2019s expense to provide her with job skills that\nwill make her more employable once she enters the United States. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has\nbeen a student and has never held a job.  \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n5\nIn addition to her parents, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has two grandmothers and a number\nof friends who are citizens and residents of Ukraine. Applicant estimates her father is in his\nmid-50s and her mother is in her late 40s. Both previously were employed as civil\nengineers at a nuclear power plant. Applicant has informed his fianc\u00e9 and the other\nUkrainian women he was romantically involved with that he works as a linguist. However,\nhe has told his fiance\u2019s parents that he is a car salesman. \nApplicant originally indicated he and his fianc\u00e9 would likely return to Ukraine to have\na second wedding ceremony after they were married in the United States. After his most\nrecent visit to Ukraine, he indicated they probably will not have a second ceremony. When\nquestioned about what he would do if his fianc\u00e9 decided she wanted to return to Ukraine\nto reside after they were married, Applicant only expressed confidence that she would\nnever express such a choice.    \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B (foreign influence), with\nits disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n6\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s two sisters and his father, if he is still alive, are citizens and resident of\nIraq. Applicant maintained fairly regular but intermittent contact with his older sister and\nfather from the time he fled Iraq until sometime in or about 2004. He sent his father money\non four occasions, the last time being in either 1998 or 1999. As to Applicant\u2019s Iraqi\nrelatives, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a): contact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion applies. \nApplicant has not had any contact with his Iraqi relatives for about five years. At\npresent, he does not even know if his father is dead or alive. While stationed in Iraq with\nthe U. S. military, Applicant did not avail himself of the opportunity to even attempt to\ncontact his father or sisters. While he has expressed a desire to see them in the future,\nthat desire is contingent upon Iraq obtaining the politically stability that would not jeopardize\nhis relatives by such a visit. Mitigating Condition (MC) 8(c): contact or communication with\n\n The Appeal Board has stated: As a general rule, an applicant\u2019s prior history of complying with\n13\nsecurity procedures and regulations is considered to be of relatively low probative value . . . . (citations\nomitted) However, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, where\nthe applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance with security procedures\nand regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had\nmade a significant contribution to national security. (citations omitted) The presence of such circumstances\ncan give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report\nattempts at coercion or exploitation. \nW hen an \u201cApplicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S.,\n[his behavior] constitute[s] important evidence that Applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. could\nbe sufficiently strong that he [could] be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Directive\n\u00b6 E2.8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (Applicant\u2019s work as an interpreter in\nAfghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant\ncontribution to the national security.\u201d) ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr 9, 2008)\n7\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create\na risk for foreign influence or exploitation applies. \nApplicant has professed his total loyalty to the United States and has demonstrated\nit by repeatedly serving valiantly with United States military forces while under hostile fire.\nThree American military officers have vouched for his work ethic, his diligence and his\ndedication to duty while serving in combat on behalf of the United States. His past combat\nactions on behalf of the United States completely support his credible assertions that he\nwould resolve any potential conflict that might arise due to his Iraqi relatives in favor of the\nUnited States. I am satisfied MC 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest applies.   \n13\nApplicant is engaged to a woman who is citizen and resident of Ukraine. Her\nparents, grandparents and friends are all citizens and residents of Ukraine. He met her\nover the internet and then visited with her for the first time in Ukraine and United Arab\nEmirates for three weeks in December 2008. In January 2009, he applied for a fianc\u00e9 visa\nfor her to enter the United States. She has never before been to the United States, and is\nfirst expected by Applicant to come to this country to marry him in or about August 2009.\nThey may or may not return to Ukraine for a wedding ceremony after they are married in\nthe United States. \nAdditionally, Applicant has become involved in at least one romantic relationship\nwith a Ukrainian woman residing in Ukraine other than his fianc\u00e9. He remains friends with\nher, in addition to another Ukrainian woman he met in the United States who has now\nmoved back to Ukraine, and with other Ukrainian citizens and residents. He has visited and\nstayed with some of those people in Ukraine on numerous occasions. \nDC 7(a): contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\n\n Background Note: Ukraine, U.S. Department of States, dated March 2008.

(GE\n11)\n    \n     \n    \n8\ncoercion applies to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his fianc\u00e9, her parents and other relatives,\nand his friends who are all citizens and residents of Ukraine. Further, if Applicant does\nmarry his fianc\u00e9 as planned, an additional security concern will arise under DC 7(d):\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\nUnlike Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Iraqi relatives, there is no evidence upon\nwhich to base a decision of how he might resolve any potential conflict that might arise due\nto his Ukrainian fianc\u00e9, her relatives and friends, and/or his other Ukrainian friends. His\nrelationship with all those persons is current and ongoing and he has traveled to Ukraine\nfrequently to spend time with those persons. \nApplicant is self-assured his fianc\u00e9 will adjust to her relocation to the United States.\nHowever, the facts that she is a relatively youthful only child who has lived with her parents\nher entire life, that she has never been employed but rather has been a student her entire\nlife, that she has never resided outside Ukraine, that she is substantially younger than\nApplicant, and that their relationship has been of a short duration and is based on no more\nthan five weeks of personal contact does not support his optimism. It is of course\nimpossible to predict what the future will hold for Applicant and his fianc\u00e9 when and if she\nrelocates to the United States. Additionally, Applicant has minimal significant ties to the\nUnited States making it equally impossible to predict what Applicant\u2019s response will be if\nhis fianc\u00e9 decides she cannot adjust to life in the United States and wants to return to\nUkraine. \nBased on the uncertainties that currently exist due to Applicant\u2019s ties to his fianc\u00e9,\nher family, and his friends in Ukraine, MC 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest does apply. \nI have also considered the information of which I have taken administrative notice\nconcerning Ukraine.  That information discloses that Ukraine is a country that has\n14\nexperienced a degree of political and economic instability since it gained independence\nfollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. It has a continuing complex relationship\nwith Russia as evidenced by Russia cutting off natural gas supplies in January 2006,\ndespite Ukrainian assertions that Russia is a permanent strategic partner of Ukraine. \n\n9\nOn the other hand, Ukraine has sought entry into the World Trade Organization, the\nEuropean Union, and NATO. It has made a substantial contribution to U.N peacekeeping\noperations. Further, there is nothing to indicate Ukraine has engaged in any espionage\nefforts, economic or otherwise, since obtaining its independence.  \nConsidering all available information about Ukraine, Applicant is entitled to\nsubstantial consideration under MC 8(a):  . . . the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  \nBalancing the disqualifying condition that applies and the disqualifying condition that\nwill apply when Applicant marries his fianc\u00e9 against the consideration due Applicant under\nMC 8(a), and factoring in Applicant\u2019s minimal contacts within the United States, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concern that exists due to his relationships with\npersons in Ukraine. There exists too much uncertainty about what will happen when\nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 arrives in the United States, and thereafter, to affirmatively state he has\nmet his burden to present sufficient evidence to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the case\nagainst him.\n \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, including Applicant\u2019s exceptional service on behalf of the United\nStates in combat situations and the letters of recommendation he submitted in support\nthereof, the factors listed in \u00b66.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant failed to mitigate the foreign influence\nsecurity concern that exists in this case based on his relationships in Ukraine. He has not\novercome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline\nB is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n\n",

Applicant denied all of the debts. The lender for the $19,792 mortgage debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a had not notified him of a residual balance after the foreclosure and action sale of his previous residence and had not pursued collection. Applicant contested the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.b and the validity of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Brian K. Valentine, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started after a job layoff in late 2001. Efforts to\nresolve his delinquent debts and to meet his other financial obligations, including court-\nordered child and spousal support, are sufficient to mitigate the financial concerns.\nClearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on April 9, 2005.\nOn November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a security clearance and\nrefer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nJune 17, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 4, 2008. He submitted\nan undated Answer to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  The case was\noriginally assigned to another DOHA administrative judge on February 18, 2009, due to\nworkload considerations. On March 3, 2009, it was transferred to me because it was\nwithin my area of geographical responsibility, and on March 13, 2009, I scheduled a\nhearing for March 31, 2009. Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance on March 24,\n2009.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on March 31, 2009. The government\nsubmitted eight exhibits (Ex. 1-8) and Applicant submitted 39 exhibits (Ex. A-MM) that\nwere admitted without any objections. Applicant and one witness, his security manager,\nalso testified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 9, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open after the hearing until April 14,\n2009, for him to submit additional documentation. Applicant timely forwarded nine\nadditional documents (Ex. NN-VV). On April 15, 2009, I ordered the government to\nrespond by April 15, 2009, or the documents would be admitted into the record as\nmarked. On April 16, 2009, Department Counsel indicated that he had received exhibits\nNN through UU and the government did not object to those eight exhibits. Accordingly,\nthose documents were entered into the record as full exhibits.\nDepartment Counsel did not comment on Applicant\u2019s affidavit identifying and\ncommenting on the proposed exhibits, which had been marked as Exhibit VV and was\nclearly identified as such in my order. Department Counsel had been advised to inform\nme as soon as possible if he did not receive any or all of the proposed exhibits. In the\nabsence of any indication from Department Counsel that he had not received proposed\nexhibit VV or that he had any objections, the document was also accepted into the\nrecord as an exhibit.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $39,813 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g). Applicant denied all of the\ndebts. The lender for the $19,792 mortgage debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a had not notified\nhim of a residual balance after the foreclosure and action sale of his previous residence\nand had not pursued collection. Applicant contested the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.b and the\nvalidity of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. He provided documentation showing that the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d had been paid, and maintained that SOR \u00b6 1.g had been satisfied as\nwell. Applicant initially averred he did not recognize the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c,\nalthough he subsequently paid it. After considering the pleadings, testimony, and\nexhibits entered into the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old certified safety professional, who has been employed\nprimarily in the defense sector since he earned his bachelor of science degree in\nelectrical engineering in 1985. He has held a security clearance for about 20 of the past\n\n3\n24 years, including for his work as a principal engineer in systems safety for his current\ndefense contractor employer since April 2006 (Tr. 38). In addition to his regular\nemployment, Applicant has had his own consulting business since March 2001,\nproviding systems engineering and systems safety engineering services to industry (Ex.\n1, Ex. A).\nApplicant and his first wife married in November 1980, when he was only 20 and\nshe was 25. They made their home in a western state where Applicant began college in\n1981. Six children were born to them between March 1982 and September 1992 (Ex. 1,\nTr. 67). One of their daughters died in 1989 at age 14 months (Tr. 68).\nApplicant started his career as an electrical engineer with a defense contractor in\nits hazard\u2019s analysis department in May 1985 (Tr. 45). He was initially granted a\nconfidential clearance for his duties (Ex. 2). On November 20, 1985, Applicant\nsubmitted a Personnel Security Questionnaire for a secret clearance (Ex. 2). In March\n1990, Applicant was promoted to the position of a senior engineer with his employer\n(Ex. A), and he was granted a secret clearance in August 1991 (Ex. 1). On January 1,\n1991, Applicant was designated as an associate safety professional by the board of\ncertified safety professionals, having successfully completed the core examination for\nsafety professionals (Ex. G). In about  February 1993, he was laid off after almost eight\nyears with his employer (Tr. 49). \nFollowing a few months as a consultant field safety supervisor on a satellite\nlaunch vehicle project (Tr. 49), Applicant began working as a manager developing and\nimplementing safety systems and environmental policy for a federal contractor located\nin the northeastern U.S. (Ex. A). The company ceased operations when the owner died,\nand in late September 1995, Applicant began working as an engineer for a defense\ncontractor\u2019s armament systems division in the Midwest. While leading the system safety\nefforts for an international, contractor-funded demonstration validation program\ninvolving a light towed howitzer, he worked as a subcontractor on an arsenal ship\nlaunch system (Ex. A, Tr. 48). In August 1996, Applicant was board certified as a safety\nprofessional in system safety aspects (Ex. F). His earned income increased from\n$51,611 in 1995 to $62,742 in 1996 (Ex. W).\n In about August 1998, Applicant and his spouse purchased the home that they\nhad rented. They took out a principal mortgage of $160,000 that was not beyond their\nmeans. Over the 1998 to 2000 time frame, Applicant had earned wages of more than\n$75,000 annually (Ex. W).\nIn April 2001, he began working as a chief consulting specialist for a company in\nthe metro Washington, D.C. area. He worked out of his home in the Midwest, but he\nwas required to travel to D.C. In an effort to reduce the travel costs, he set up a field\noffice in upstate New York at his expense (Tr. 66-67). In May 2001, he and his spouse\ntook out a second mortgage loan on their home of $68,550 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Ex. 5, Ex. 7).\nIn about August 2001, he and his spouse separated, and she returned with their two\ndaughters and their youngest son to live with her father in the area where she and\n\n4\nApplicant had begun their married life (Ex. 1, Ex. 7, Ex. A). Their oldest son was already\nliving on his own. Their 16-year-old son stayed with Applicant (Tr. 68). \nApplicant was laid off in November 2001 due to a lack of federal contracts as the\ngovernment began to focus on antiterrorism after September 11, 2001. Applicant took\nhis 401(k) funds of about $4,000 and gave them to his spouse for herself and their\nchildren, and he and his son lived off his unemployment compensation of $1,200 a\nmonth (Tr. 69). Applicant\u2019s spouse filed for divorce in December 2001, although she\nwithdrew the paperwork in March 2002 because he was still unemployed (Ex. 7).\nApplicant\u2019s earned income dropped precipitously from $88,218 in 2001 to only\n$1,313 in 2002 and $9,147 in 2003 (Ex. W, Ex. Y). He struggled to pay his mortgage\nand other bills due to his lack of income, and he fell behind on several financial\naccounts (Ex. 1). He made payments on an installment loan of $3,383 taken out in\nDecember 2001 for a computer only through March 2002, and it was referred for\ncollection (Ex. 6, Ex. 7). As of July 2002, he owed a medical debt of $620.47 that he\nfailed to pay (SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Ex. CC). In September 2002, his primary mortgage became\ndelinquent after his unemployment compensation ran out (Ex. 5, Ex. 6, Ex. 7, Tr. 158).\nHe had stopped making regular payments on his second mortgage in late 2001 (Tr.\n158, 161).\nIn September 2002, Applicant accepted a loan offer of about $10,000 that he\nreceived in the mail (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He used about $7,000 of the loan to retain an\nemployment agency\u2019s services, and used a portion to replace a failed refrigerator\n(Answer). He subsequently reconfigured the loan and obtained a new note for the\nbalance of $7,824 (Answer, Exhibit 5).\nIn mid-October 2002, Applicant took a field services position on commission. The\njob involved soliciting customers for a reengineering services business, and it required\nextensive travel, five to six days per week (Ex. 1, Ex. A). His teenage son was left alone\nin their home in the Midwest when Applicant was on travel. In November 2002, the barn\non their property burned down. His son had put heat lamps in the barn to keep their dog\nwarm, and the dog tipped over the lamps (Ex. 7, Tr. 14). Applicant\u2019s son left to live with\nhis mother after the fire (Tr. 75).\nOver the December 2002 to February 2003 time frame, Applicant had the\naluminum siding replaced on his home due to storm damage incurred in September\n2002. In January 2003, siding removal caused gaps in the foundation\u2019s insulation and\nthe pipes froze, leading to flooding in the basement. After the siding was installed, he\nlisted the home for sale at $250,000 (Tr. 80) in about March 2003. While insurance paid\nfor the siding replacement and basement damage, two dumpsters were left in his yard\nthat hindered the sale of the residence (Tr. 76). In April 2003, Applicant received notice\nof foreclosure for failure to keep up with the mortgage payments. He filed for an\nextension to forestall the foreclosure under the state\u2019s homestead act (Ex. 7).\nIn April 2003, Applicant resigned from his job due to the excessive travel and\nexpenses that he could not maintain. He began staying in New England as he looked\n\n5\nfor a position on the East Coast (Ex. 1, Ex. 7). Applicant obtained a new realtor to sell\nhis home in the Midwest, but the house was foreclosed on, and the holder of the second\nmortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) bought the property in a sheriff\u2019s auction in July 2003 (Ex. 7, Ex.\nQQ, Tr. 77-78). Applicant did not believe that he had any further liability because the\nholder of the second mortgage had acquired his equity in the property (Tr. 77-79). The\nproperty had been valued at $219,400 for tax purposes (Ex. RR), and he owed\n$160,605.18 on the primary mortgage (Ex. QQ) and about $18,223 on the second\nmortgage (Ex. 5).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse proceeded with the divorce in 2003 after he became\nemployed (Ex. 7). In March 2003, Applicant was ordered to pay $721 in child support.\nThe amount was increased to $776 per month in June 2003 (Ex. 6, Ex. 7, Ex. LL).\nApplicant had given his wife some money for the bills, but had not made the child\nsupport payments. In about September 2004, he was ordered to pay $998 per month in\nchild support and $1,200 in spousal support. His wages were garnished until the\narrearage of about $10,000 was paid off (Ex. 7). As of March 1, 2009, he had paid a\ntotal of $63,581.41 in child support (Ex. LL) and $64,800 in spousal support (Ex. MM).\nFor about six weeks in early 2004, Applicant worked as a mechanical inspector\nfor an electronics company. At the end of February 2004, he returned to the defense\nsector as a senior engineer for a company in Virginia. Applicant had employment\nearnings of about $69,134 in 2004 (Ex. W).\nApplicant applied for renewal of his security clearance, completing a SF 86 on\nApril 15, 2004. In response to the financial record inquiries, he listed the wage\ngarnishment for the child support at $1,700, and the foreclosure of his home in 2004.\nHe responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 38 concerning any debts over 180 days delinquent in\nthe last 7 years, and listed 14 delinquent obligations totaling $ 29,297, including the\ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. On or about April 9, 2005, he updated the SF 86\nwhile still with the same employer, and indicated that $5,917 of the debt had been\nsatisfied, including the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d (Ex. 1), which was from an overdraft account\n(Tr. 124). In response to collection action dated March 26, 2004, Applicant began\nrepaying the debt in late April 2004, by a first check in the amount of $423.73 (Ex. 8).\nOn receipt of a final payment of $247.28 in February 2005, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d was\npaid in full (Ex. DD). \nFrom November 2004 to November 2005, Applicant pursued his master\u2019s degree\nin business administration from an online university. He took out loans totaling $18,500\nfrom a financial branch of the university in December 2004. According to Applicant, the\nloans required a prepaid interest and fee from the proceeds. After the fees for the first\nclass were taken by the university, the residual balance was returned to the student. In\nlate 2005, Applicant signed up for a class that he decided not to take because he was\nbusy at work. Reminded by his financial counselor at the university that payment of\n$1,369 was due by November 29, 2005, for the class beginning on December 6, 2005,\nApplicant requested at 7:49 p.m. on November 21, 2005, a form to request a leave of\nabsence. He was advised that he would have to submit the request that day, which was\nhis last day of class. At around 10:57 later that night, Applicant sent a scanned copy by\n\nThere is no evidence that the leave of absence was approved or even received by the university. The\n1\nform included in Exhibit 7 does not bear the signature of a campus representative. \n6\nelectronic mail to his financial counselor. University records fail to confirm receipt of the\ncompleted Leave of Absence form (Ex. HH), and Applicant admits he did not hear back\nfrom the university about his request at the time (Tr. 136). On January 17, 2006,\nApplicant was informed that because of a break in attendance, $3,656 of his student\nloan funds had been returned to the lender and that he had a shortfall in his university\naccount. Applicant disputed the debt on the basis that he had applied for the leave of\nabsence,  but he returned to the university on January 31, 2006, with a reported\n1\nshortfall of $3,530 in his account. Applicant\u2019s application was recertified for a loan\nperiod of January 31, 2006, through April 18, 2006. After receipt of $1,844 in payment\nby credit card for the new class and $1,813.90 in financial aid, he owed $1,716.10 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.f) on his account (Ex. 3, Ex. 7, Ex. GG, Ex. HH, Tr. 135-38). In or about May 2007,\nthe university referred the unpaid balance for collection (Ex. 5). Applicant subsequently\nrequested confirmation that the funds had been returned to the lender so that he would\nnot be repaying the debt twice (Ex. GG). The university continued to assert that he\nowed the debt balance.\nIn April 2006, Applicant began his present employment as a senior principal\nsystems engineer. His secret clearance was transferred to his new employer (Ex. A). In\nmid-August 2006, Applicant and his then fiancee bought a three bedroom home for\n$330,000 (Ex. U). They took out a joint mortgage loan of $297,000 (Ex. 5), and a\nsecond mortgage of $16,000 from the seller (Ex. S).\nApplicant and his current wife married in December 2006, and Applicant became\na stepfather to two minor children. Applicant\u2019s wife is a disabled veteran who is unable\nto work due to post-traumatic stress disorder. She was on social security disability of\n$680 per month and received Veterans Administration benefits of $2,390 (Ex. NN).\nApplicant had pretax earnings of $139,823 in 2006, $106,873 in 2007, and $110,394 in\n2008 (Ex. W). Applicant\u2019s spouse received no child support from the father of her two\nsons from the time she separated from him in 2002. Although the boys\u2019 father bought\ntoys, computers, games, clothing, and shoes (Ex. NN), Applicant provided his stepsons\nwith food and shelter. In January 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse pursued child support from\nher sons\u2019 father. In May 2007, she began to receive child support at $525 per month,\nbut it began a difficult and costly court battle. The boys chose to live with their father,\nand in July 2007, he was granted sole legal custody. Applicant\u2019s spouse was awarded a\njudgment of $5,010.72 to cover the costs of caring for her sons when she received no\nchild support. But since the boys were living with their father, she was ordered to pay\nnominal child support of $100 per month from September 2007. Applicant supported his\nspouse throughout the lawsuit and helped pay her legal fees (Ex. NN). In 2007\nApplicant took out a loan (current value $12,496 as of March 2009) from his 401(k)\naccount at work. He used the funds to pay his spouse\u2019s legal expenses in the custody\nbattle and some of his debts (Tr. 184, 197-98).\nApplicant\u2019s credit report of May 30, 2007, listed several unpaid balances: a $167\ntelephone debt in collection since March 2006; a $1,750 utility (gas) services debt in\n\nThe credit report contained another listing for the creditor showing a $10,350 balance as of December\n2\n2003. A $7,952 balance was reported as of September 2004 (Ex. 4).\n7\ncollection since February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $249 past due utility services debt from\n2003; $7,952 owed on the loan taken out in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $630 for\nmedical services from June 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $212 collection debt from November\n2006 for an unpaid speeding ticket (SOR \u00b6 1.g); the delinquency owed the university\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f); a collection debt of $881 for cellular telephone services; and a past due\nbalance of $18,223 on the second mortgage on the foreclosed property (SOR \u00b6 1.a)\n(Ex. 5). Applicant was also past due 60 days on his mortgage on his current residence\nas of May 2007 (Ex. 5, Ex. KK).\nOn July 11, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis financial issues. He indicated he and his spouse had joint monthly income of\n$11,990, $8,000 from his work as a safety engineer with a defense contractor and his\nspouse\u2019s veterans and social security disability benefits of $3,990. After paying monthly\nexpenses, including his child support, they had $3,606.35 for miscellaneous and\nemergency expenses and repayment of a $10,000 personal loan. Applicant was paying\na friend between $250 and $500 a month for money borrowed when he was\nunemployed.  Applicant acknowledged he had been contacted by a collection agency\nabout the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and that he had not made any payments on the debt. He\nsurmised that the $212 debt was from a speeding ticket, but he had not been pursued\nfor collection. Applicant indicated that with respect to his student loans, he had\nconsolidated them in July 2007 and had not yet commenced repayment. He disputed\nthe $1,716 debt claimed by the university, and expressed his belief that the second\nmortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had been included in the foreclosure. He asserted he paid off the\n$5,000 line of credit debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d), but acknowledged a delinquent wireless phone\ndebt of $881 (not alleged in the SOR) had not been paid. Applicant was asked about\ndelinquent local real estate taxes as well. He claimed to have not realized that they had\nnot been paid, and he planned to set up an escrow account to pay them. Applicant\nindicated that he was 30 to 60 days late from time to time in his utility bills but he always\ncaught up (Ex. 7). On September 7, 2007, Applicant was reinterviewed to discuss his\nchild support arrearage. He indicated that the arrearage had been satisfied in late 2004\nor early 2005. He was also asked about the $630 medical debt, which he surmised was\neither for  counseling sessions with his ex-wife in 2000 or for blood testing for his\nchildren (Ex. 7).\nApplicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s joint adjusted gross income for tax year 2007 was\n$88,644 (Ex. R), excluding her nontaxable VA benefit (Tr. 90). Yet, his credit report on\nJuly 17, 2008, showed outstanding balances on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.b,  and\n2\n1.e, and for telephone and utility services ($167 and $249 not alleged in the SOR). As of\nJune 2008, Applicant also reportedly owed $854 on a Discover card account closed by\nthe grantor, and $1,032 on a line of credit taken out in June 2007. He was current on his\nmortgage taken out in August 2006 (Ex. 4). As of September 30, 2008, Applicant\u2019s\ncredit report had been updated to show he had paid the $249 and $167 utility/telephone\ndebts. The balance of his consolidated student loan debt was reported to be $18,453\n\nApplicant testified he paid the debt in March 2009 by debit card (Tr. 123), but the evidence shows\n3\n(Exhibit OO) it was paid by a MasterCard.\nExhibit Z, the  letter confirming that the collections servicing agency for the mortgagee had asked the\n4\ncredit bureaus to delete the tradeline from their records, was sent to Applicant\u2019s former spouse at the address\nof the foreclosed property. It is unclear why the letter was solely under her name. The credit reports show it\nwas a joint mortgage loan so both Applicant and his former spouse were contractually liable. Although\nApplicant indicated in July 2007 that he became solely responsible for the debt following their divorce (Ex. 7),\nthe debt had been deleted from his credit report as of March 28, 2009 (Ex. KK).\n8\nand it was rated as current (Ex. 3). In August 2009, Applicant satisfied the $881 wireless\nphone debt (Ex. KK).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on September 19,\n2008, that the $167 debt and the $5,192.73 balance of SOR \u00b6 1.d had been paid\n(confirmed by documentation, see Ex. 8, Ex. DD). He again disputed any responsibility\nfor the university debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He explained that he had reconfigured the $10,350\nloan for $7,952 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but he had been unsuccessful to date in reaching the\ncurrent assignee. Applicant maintained that the gas company allegedly owed the $1,750\ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) had agreed to remove it from his credit report (Ex. 8).\nIn addition to maintaining his full time employment, Applicant entered into a\ncontract with another defense contractor in December 2008 to provide services through\nSeptember 30, 2011, on a time and materials basis at a fixed hourly rate starting at\n$117.38 for calendar year 2008 and ending at $132.04 for calendar year 2011. The\ncontract had a ceiling of $74,723 (Ex. Q, Tr. 86). This contract work has been approved\nby his employer and it is contingent on renewal of his security clearance (Tr. 86-87).\nApplicant satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which was for an old speeding ticket\n(Tr. 140), on January 5, 2009 (Ex. II). On or about March 26, 2009, Applicant sent a\nletter to the collection agency in SOR \u00b6 1.b to inquire if it was still holding the debt (Ex.\nBB). The letter was returned by the postal service as undeliverable (Ex. PP). Applicant\nintends to make payments on the debt once he determines the correct collector (Tr.\n133-34). On or before April 6, 2009, Applicant satisfied the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c,\npaying $629.50 by credit card (Ex. OO) .\n3\nApplicant continued to dispute with the credit bureaus the adverse credit listings\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f. As of March 20, 2009, the adverse credit data concerning\nthe second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had been deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report (Ex.\nZ, Tr. 81).  The creditor allegedly owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e notified Applicant by letter\n4\ndated December 15, 2008, that the adverse credit information (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was\nincorrect and that the charges of $1,102.04 would not be considered outstanding (Ex.\nFF). On or about February 19, 2009, Trans Union deleted the debt from Applicant\u2019s\ncredit record (Ex. EE). However, on March 19, 2009, the university (SOR \u00b6 1.e) notified\nhim that upon review of his account, the past due $1,716.10 balance was correct (Ex.\nHH). Applicant still disputes his responsibility because the university failed to inform him\nthat there was a problem with his leave of absence. He wants the university to\nacknowledge its shortcoming before he pays the debt, although he acknowledges that\n\nApplicant testified he had been unaware initially that the mortgage holder had not set up an escrow\n5\naccount. After he found out that he owed local property taxes, he set up the escrow account. The shortfall is\nexpected to be satisfied as of September 2009 (Tr. 95-96).\nApplicant had borrowed $10,000 from a friend when he was unemployed (Tr. 98). The balance of the\n6\nloan is now about $7,500 (Ex. S).\n9\nhe will likely have to pay it because he needs to finish his classes for his M.B.A. (Tr.\n139-40).\nAs of January 2009, the mortgage on Applicant\u2019s present residence had a\nprincipal balance of $292,506.71. The monthly mortgage payment was $3,885.49 due to\na shortage in the escrow account  (Ex. V). Once the escrow shortfall is paid off in\n5\nSeptember 2009, his mortgage payment will decrease by $527.02 per month (Tr. 96).\nAs of late March 2009, Applicant and his spouse had joint monthly income of $11,691.\nTheir joint monthly expenses totaled $11,412.31, which included $1,200 in spousal\nsupport for his ex-wife, $582.16 in child support for his youngest child who is 17 (Tr. 92),\n$370.44 for an unsecured loan taken out in October 2008 to cover a mortgage payment\n(Ex. KK, Tr. 184), $300 for a $7,500 personal loan debt owed a friend,  and $114.86 in\n6\nstudent loan repayment (Ex. S). Applicant received notification from his employer that\nas of April 13, 2009, his annual salary would increase from $111,300 to $114,600 (Ex.\nTT). \nApplicant has inquired into debt counseling but had significant reservations\nbecause of the potential negative impact on his credit score (Ex. SS). He is considering\nrefinancing their mortgage since the interest rate is a high 9.5% (Tr. 97). Applicant owes\na balance of $500 on the closed Discover credit card account on which he is making\nmonthly payments. The account was rated as current as of late March 2009 (Ex. KK).\nHe has been late several times on his utility payments at his current residence (Tr. 185).\nAlthough Applicant will no longer have to pay child support after his son reaches age 18\nin September 2010 (Ex. 1, Tr. 92), he is required to pay spousal support to his ex-wife\nfor 26 years from the date of their divorce, provided she does not remarry (Tr. 190).\nApplicant has not allowed any financial problems to negatively affect his job\nperformance. A supervisor from Applicant\u2019s previous employment between February\n2004 and April 2006 considered Applicant to be an extremely talented engineer and an\nasset to a military safety review board (Ex. O). Applicant supports several programs in\nhis current job as the company\u2019s subject matter expert in systems safety. His demeanor\nand performance have been \u201cexemplary.\u201d Applicant has adhered to the policies and\nprocedures concerning the proper handling and safeguarding of classified and sensitive\nproprietary information (Ex. K, Ex. L, Tr. 152-53). He received overall annual\nperformance ratings of outstanding in 2006 (Ex. J), and of excellent in 2007 (Ex. I) and\n2008 (Ex. H). His acting manager recommended him for promotion to the position of a\nsenior principal safety engineer (Ex. H). Applicant received monetary awards for his\ncontributions in October 2008 (Ex. C) and in December 2008 (Ex. B).\n\n10\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems more extensive than the SOR would\nindicate. He listed 14 delinquent accounts totaling $29,297 on his 2004 SF 86, including\na substantial child support arrearage that was paid off through garnishments of his\nwages. When he updated his application a year later, about $5,917 of the debt had\nbeen satisfied, including the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He continued to resolve some debts,\nalthough as of his subject interview in July 2007, he owed several past due balances:  a\ndebt to the university of $1,716 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), unpaid medical debt of about $630 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c), $212 for an old speeding ticket that he did not consider a priority (SOR \u00b6 1.g),\nabout $7,952 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on an installment loan taken out in 2002 to pay for\nprofessional job placement help, and about $1,297 in utility/telephone balances not\nalleged in the SOR. As of the issuance of the SOR in November 2008, Applicant had\npaid the delinquent utility/telephone debts not alleged, but the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c,\n1.f, and 1.g had not been resolved. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant\u2019s credit report continued to show a delinquent debt of about $18,223 on\na second mortgage following foreclosure of his residence in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and\na $1,750 gas services debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) associated with the foreclosed property (Ex. 3).\nHowever, the evidence falls short of establishing that Applicant is liable for either of the\nalleged debts. Applicant does not deny that he stopped paying on his second mortgage\nin late 2001 after he was laid off, but he assumed any balance remaining on the loan\nhad been less than the value of the property redeemed by the holder of the second\nmortgage in the foreclosure auction. There is no evidence that a deficiency judgment\nwas granted the lender and Applicant received no notice of a deficiency balance.\nSimilarly, while Applicant is sure that he owed a balance for gas services at the\nforeclosed property, the trade line was removed from his credit report. The creditor\u2019s\naccounting system was unable to confirm the balance or allow for repayment. Neither\ncreditor intends to pursue collection at this point. While AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e,\nApplicant has not successfully disputed his liability for the university debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f\n\n12\nbased on Exhibit HH. Applicant\u2019s leave of absence form, filed at the eleventh hour, was\napparently not received by the university, and he must share some responsibility in that\nhe made no effort at the time to ensure that all the paperwork had been properly filed\nand that his request had been approved. \nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be fully applied\nin mitigation. While Applicant\u2019s financial problems started because of a job layoff in\nNovember 2001, the university debt was incurred in 2006 when Applicant was gainfully\nemployed by a defense contractor earning a salary of about $100,000 annually. That\ndebt has yet to be paid. Moreover, the evidence shows that he was more than 60 days\nbehind in his mortgage in April and May 2007. He borrowed more than $10,000 from his\n401(k) at work in 2007 to pay for his spouse\u2019s legal fees in her custody fight over her\nchildren and to pay some bills. He has had some recent difficulty meeting all his\nfinancial obligations on time.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is implicated. After Applicant was laid off,\nhis earned income dropped precipitously from about $88,218 in 2001 to only $1,313 in\n2002 and $9,147 in 2003. While he was paid unemployment compensation, it was not\nenough to cover the two mortgages on his home. Although he began working for a\ndefense contractor in February 2004 at a salary of more than $60,000 annually, his\nwages were garnished to repay his child support arrearage that accrued due to\ninsufficient employment income. In 2007, Applicant and his spouse incurred legal fees\nrelated to the custody battle over her children which took funds that otherwise would\nhave been available to resolve debts. This expense was voluntary but not frivolous.\nApplicant has also been paying $1,200 per month in spousal support in addition to his\nchild support since 2004, which has had a significant impact on his finances.\nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, Applicant must have acted responsibly to address\nhis debts once he was in a position to do so. In this regard, the government has\nlegitimate concerns about Applicant\u2019s delay in resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c,\nand 1.g. He did not pay the $212 speeding ticket until January 2009 because he did not\nconsider it the most prudent expenditure, despite its relatively minor amount. His efforts\nto contact the collection agency in SOR \u00b6 1.b were sporadic and initiated in the fall of\n2008. He did not pay the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c until March 2009. At the same time,\nit must be acknowledged that Applicant resolved other delinquencies before the SOR\nwas issued. Given the substantial negative impact of an unforeseen layoff, his\ncompliance since 2004 with his child and spousal support obligations, and his efforts to\nresolve other debts that were not alleged, AG \u00b6 20(b) fully applies.\nConsidering his handling of his debts as a whole, AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthere are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\n\n13\ndebts,\u201d apply, despite the fact that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f have not been\nresolved. He intends to repay his delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b as soon as he can make\npayment arrangements with the creditor that holds the debt. While he continues to\ncontest his responsibility for SOR \u00b6 1.f, he realizes he will likely have to pay it. Applicant\nis likely to resolve these debts in the near future knowing that failure to do so could\nimpact his job and his consulting contract. With the  merit increase in his salary effective\nApril 13, 2009 (Ex. TT), Applicant is in a better position financially. His finances will\nimprove significantly once his escrow shortfall is satisfied in September 2009.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\n\n14\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nFor the most part, Applicant has \u201ca meaningful track record\u201d of paying his financial\nobligations. He complied with court-ordered child and spousal support obligations once\nhe was in a financial position to do so. As for the debts that were not paid on time,\nApplicant has not continued to ignore or disregard the debts. He disputed the university\ndebt through proper channels, and set up an escrow account with his mortgage holder\nto pay off his delinquent property taxes. He attempted to contact the creditor in SOR \u00b6\n1.b by telephone and letter. He continued to support his spouse in her efforts to retain\ncustody of her children, even to the extent of borrowing from his 401(k) to pay her legal\nfees. Past and present coworkers who have had an opportunity to observe his\ndedication and compliance with security regulations hold him in high regard. Applicant is\nnot likely to resort to illegal acts to generate funds to pay the proved unresolved\ndelinquent debts, which amount to less than $10,000. Based on a whole-person\nassessment, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue the\nsecurity clearance that Applicant has held for some 20 years.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information\nis granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on April 4, 2006, as part of her employment with a defense contractor. On June \n2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns about financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 11, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 30, 2009. She admitted 15 and \ndenied two of the Guideline F allegations with explanation, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July \n17, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on July 24, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on August 13, 2009, for a hearing on September 1, 2009. Applicant signed for \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe Notice of Hearing on August 19, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \ngovernment offered five exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her behalf. She offered 16 \nexhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through O which were received without \nobjection. The record was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  \nApplicant timely submitted 14 additional documents, marked App. Ex. P through CC, \nwere received without objection (Gov. Ex. 6, Department counsel letter, dated \nSeptember 29, 2009). All of the post-hearing documents had previously been admitted \nduring the hearing, and there are no additional or new documents. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 8, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 19, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of September 1, 2009, prior to the mailing of a \nNotice of Hearing. Accordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the \nhearing.  However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 14 days prior to the \nhearing. She waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 6-7). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 26 year old and has been an administrative assistant for a defense \ncontractor for over four years. She has been attending college part time and is nearing \naward of a degree. She is single with no children. As a student, Applicant was employed \nduring the school year in the school athletic department and worked during the \nsummers in a store. She has been continuously employed full time since August 2004 \nexcept for the months of May, June, and July 2005. She is active in her church. Her \npastor and his wife live with her (Tr. 32-33; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated April 4, 2006).  \n \nIn a personal financial statement completed in response to interrogatories from \nsecurity adjudicators, Applicant notes that she had a monthly negative net remainder in \nfunds of approximately $30 (SOR 1.q; Gov. ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, undated \nat 11). Applicant has since received an increase in pay from her employer. Her monthly \nincome is now $3,030, with monthly expenses of $2,980, leaving a net remainder each \nmonth of $50. Applicant stated she can cover monthly expenses. She developed a \nbudget which shows that she is meeting her present expenses (App. Ex F, Budget, \nundated). However, her budget includes payments of $50 monthly for only one \ndelinquent student loan (Tr. 49-63). Applicant presented an outline of the action she has \nor will be taking concerning her delinquent debt (App. Ex. A, Applicant's actions, dated \nAugust 27, 2009). She is meeting her tuition payments, utilities, rent, car payment, and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nother expenses (See, App. Ex. G, H, I, J, K, L, receipts and account statements, various \ndates). Applicant also has a recurring loan each month with a pay day loan company.  \nShe receives $300 each month but repays the loan with a fee of $45 (Tr. 24-31; App. \nEx. M, Receipts dated August 7, 2009) \n \nCredit reports and Applicant's admissions show the following delinquent debts: a \nstudent loan in collection for $987 (SOR 1.a); a delinquent medical debt for $139 (SOR \n1.b); a student loan in collection for $2,137 (SOR 1.c); a utility debt in collection for $186 \n(SOR 1.d); a student loan in collection for $2,270 (SOR 1.e); a telephone debt charged \noff for $188 (SOR 1.f); a collection account for the purchase of a desk top computer for \n$2,356 (SOR 1.g); an electronics store debt in collection for the purchase of a computer \nfor $2,749 (SOR 1.h); a student loan in collection for $15,000 (SOR 1.i); a student loan \nto the same creditor in collection for $3,678 (SOR 1.j); a student loan charged off for \n$5,458 (SOR 1.k); a telephone account in collection for $1,137 (SOR 1.l), a student loan \ndelinquent for than 120 days for $399 (SOR 1.m); a department store account past due \nmore than 120 days for $63 (SOR 1.n); a telephone account in collection for $1,138 \n(SOR 1.o); and a utility debt charged off for $197 (SOR 1.p). The SOR also alleges that \nApplicant's personal financial statement shows a negative net monthly remainder (SOR \n1.q; Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, undated; Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated \nJuly 28, 2006; Gov. Ex. 4 Credit report, dated October 3, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 5 Credit \nreport, dated May 9, 2009). The delinquent debts listed total $38,815, of which $29,929 \nis for student loans. \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a, is for a student loan to a local college not \nincluded in any other student loan account. Applicant intends to pay the debt but she \nhas not contacted the creditor, made any payments, or made any arrangements for \npayment (Tr. 63-64). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.b is a medical debt for a doctor. Applicant forgot \nshe owed the debt and has not contacted the creditor or made any arrangements for \npayment (Tr. 64-65). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c is a student loan. Applicant has an agreement \nwith the collection agency to pay $50 monthly on the account. Her tax refund has also \nbeen applied to her student loan debt (Tr. 65-66; App. Ex. N, Letter, dated August 13, \n2009; App. Ex. O, Letter, dated February 20, 2009).  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.d is for an utility bill incurred by Applicant in \napproximately 2005. Applicant has not contacted the creditor or taken any other action \nto pay this debt (Tr. 66). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.e is a student loan. Applicant believes this student \nloan is part of the student loans listed in SOR 1.i and 1.j since they are to the same \ncreditor and collection agency. I find that this debt is included in the student loan \ndelinquent debts set forth in SOR allegations 1.i or 1.j. No action has been taken to \ncontact the creditor, to pay the debt, or make payment arrangements (Tr. 66-68). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.f is for a telephone bill. Applicant has not taken \nany action to pay this debt (Tr. 67). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.g is for the purchase of a desk top computer in \n2002. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.h is for the purchase of a laptop computer in 2004. \nApplicant did not make any payments toward her purchase of the desk top computer. \nShe sold the desk top in 2004 but did not use any of the proceeds of the sale to make \npayments on the computer. Applicant believes she made a $100 payment towards the \nlaptop computer when it was purchased. Her arrangement with the store was for a $50 \nmonthly payment until the debt was satisfied. Applicant made only one $50 payment. \nBoth computers were purchased to assist Applicant with her school studies (Tr. 38-42, \n67-68). \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k are student loans. The delinquent \ndebt at SOR 1.m is a past due amount on the student loan debt listed at SOR 1.k. \nApplicant has not made any payments on these debts. She intends to contact the \ncreditors and make payment arrangements (Tr. 68-69). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.l is a telephone debt and is also listed at SOR 1.o \nas a collection account. Applicant had phone service but exceeded the authorized \nminutes incurring a large debt.  Applicant has not made any payments on this debt (Tr. \n69-71). \n \nThe delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.n is for a department store. Applicant has \nnot made any payment towards this account (Tr. 71). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.p is for service from a utility company when she \nresided in another state. The debt has not been paid. \n \nThe financial allegation at SOR 1.q is that the previous personal financial \nstatement noted that Applicant had a negative net remainder each month of \napproximately $30 (Tr. 72). \n \nApplicant's supervisor noted that she is an intelligent and motivated person who \nis capable of completing multiple tasks. She has an excellent positive character with \nexcellent work ethic (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated August 27, 2009). Applicant's pastor and \nhis wife wrote that they have known Applicant for over eight years. She is a mature and \ndependable person who displays a high degree of integrity and ambition. She is a \nfaithful member of their church community and assists with various administrative tasks \n(App. Ex. C, Letter, dated August 27, 2009). Another member of the church community \nwrote that she has known Applicant for over eight years. She states that Applicant is a \nmature, responsible, dependable, and compassionate person (App. Ex. D, Letter, dated \nAugust 27, 2009). Applicant's performance evaluation for her first year with the defense \ncontractor is rated significantly exceeds requirements (App. Ex. E, Evaluation, dated \nFebruary 12, 2009). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \n\n \n6 \n \n \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Most of Applicant's delinquent \ndebts are for student loans. However, she has not made any plans or taken any action \nto pay any of her delinquent debts except for one small payment of $50 a month on one \nstudent loan.   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony concerning the delinquent debts. I find that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply to the circumstances of Applicant finances. FC MC AG \u00b6 \n20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances) do not apply. The unpaid debts are considered current debts. \nApplicant has not made any payment plans or payments for the debts and she still owes \nthem. Applicant presented no reason or unusual circumstances that prevented her from \npaying her delinquent debts when they arose. She has worked continually since August \n2004 except for a short three month period. Even while attending school, she worked \nduring the school year and in the summer. Applicant has not established that her \nfinancial problems were incurred under conditions beyond her control. She has not \ndemonstrated responsible actions under the circumstances such as by contacting \ncreditors, establishing payment plans, and paying some of the debts.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nadherence to duty or obligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debt only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant \nhas not established payment plans for her debts or made reasonable, prudent attempts \nto pay her debts. She does not have a systematic, concrete method of managing her \ndelinquent finances. She has not shown a reasonable, prudent, honest course of action \nin regard to her finances. Accordingly, she has not established a good faith effort to \nresolve debt. Applicant has not mitigated security concerns based on her finances. \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's good \nreputation, as noted by letters of recommendation from her supervisor, pastor, and \nfriend. She has a good reputation in the community for trustworthiness, professionalism, \nand reliability.  \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. She is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All \nthat is required is that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems and takes \nsignificant action to implement that plan. The entirety of her financial situation and her \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which her actions to \nreduce her outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable \ninformation about the person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of debt payment. She \nhas not presented a concrete systematic plan for resolving her debt problems. She has \nno payment plans in place, and no methods of saving to pay debts. She has monthly \nincome to not only meet her present obligations, but to make some additional payments \non delinquent debts. Also of concern is Applicant's reliance on a recurring pay day loan \neach month to meet her financial needs. Even though she pays this loan each month, \nshe incurs a fee that could better be used to resolve debts. Applicant's management of \nher finances and past obligations indicates she will not be concerned, responsible, and \ncareful regarding classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She has \nnot established that she is suitable for a security clearance. I conclude Appellant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.i or 1.j) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.k) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n - 1p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \nIn his October 7, 2009, response to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of the two\nallegations raised under Guideline E and all four allegations raised under Guideline B.\nHe also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to\nanother administrative judge on June 6, 2011, but it was transferred to me on July 5,\n2011, for caseload considerations. The parties agreed to an August 8, 2011, hearing\ndate. A notice to that effect was issued by DOHA on July 19, 2011. Due to a scheduling\nconflict, an amended notice was issued on July 20, 2011, scheduling the hearing for\nAugust 10, 2011. The hearing took place as scheduled. \nNovember 30, 2011\n\n Tr. 19-20. Allegation \u00b6 2.a was amended to read: \u201cYou have two sisters and a brother who are citizens and\n1\nresidents of Lebanon.\u201d\n Ex. HE (Administrative Notice) at 1.\n2\n Id. at 2, citing to HE attachments U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3 - State\n3\nSponsors of Terrorism Overview, dated Aug. 5, 2010, at 3, and U.S. Department of State, Country Reports\non Terrorism, Chapter 6 - Terrorist Organizations (Terrorist Organizations), dated Aug. 5, 2010, at 2 and 12.\n Terrorist Organizations, supra, note 3.\n4\n2\n \nDepartment Counsel submitted four documents and information constituting a\nrequest for administrative notice concerning the country at issue (Lebanon). The\nmaterials were accepted into the record as exhibits (Ex.) 1-4 and administrative notice\nhearing exhibit (HE1 or HE) without objection. Applicant gave testimony, introduced one\nwitness, and offered 16 documents, which were accepted into the record without\nobjection as Exs. A-P. Applicant was given until August 23, 2011, to submit any\nadditional documents through Department Counsel. With the agreement of the parties,\nallegation \u00b6 2.d was struck due to a change in facts regarding Applicant\u2019s brother.\nReference to that brother was incorporated into an amended allegation \u00b6 2.a.  On\n1\nAugust 17, 2011, the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received. Also on that date,\nApplicant forwarded one additional document to Department Counsel. After it was\nforwarded to me, the document was accepted into the record without objection on\nSeptember 1, 2011, as Ex. Q. The record was then closed. Based upon a review of the\nrecord, security clearance is denied.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government\u2019s HE consists of a summary of facts about the Republic of\nLebanon and references 18 U.S. government official documents. Based on those\nmaterials, I take notice of the following: The Republic of Lebanon became independent\nin 1943. Since that time, its history \u201chas been marked by periods of political turmoil\ninterspersed with prosperity.\u201d  Although it is a parliamentary democracy, the effective\n2\nexercise of political rights was precluded during a civil war that raged from 1970s until\n1992. Post-war reconstruction through 2005 was marked by political instability,\neconomic uncertainty, assassination plots involving Lebanese officials, and clashes\nbetween Israeli military forces and Hizballah, a Shia Islamist political organization which\nhas been designated by the United States as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization\u201d and is\ndescribed as \u201cthe most technically capable terrorist group in the world.\u201d  Hizballah is\n3\nprovided political and material support by Syria, a country designated by the United\nStates as a state sponsor of terrorism and has significant intelligence assets in\nLebanon. \nThe Lebanese government recognizes Hizballah as a legitimate resistance group\nand political party.  Hizballah is closely allied with Iran. It  provides support to several\n4\nPalestinian terrorist organizations, and is known to have been involved in numerous anti\n\n Ex.

Tr. 82.\n11\n3\n \nU.S. and anti- Israeli terrorist attacks.  The United States is concerned about the role\n5\nplayed by Hizballah in the Lebanese government, noting that it \u201cclearly remains a\ndanger to Lebanon and the region.\u201d  In May 2009, the U.S. Permanent Representative\n6\nin the United Nations condemned Hizballah\u2019s \u201cunwarranted interference in the domestic\naffairs of a sovereign state.\u201d  \n7\nHuman rights violations exist within Lebanon. Its security forces have been\nknown to arbitrarily arrest and detain individuals. Detainees have experienced torture\nand abuse. Lebanese authorities frequently interfere with the privacy of persons\nregarded as enemies of the government. Americans living and working in Lebanon\nshould understand that they accept risks in remaining. The United States remains\nconcerned about the potential for violence with little or no warning.  Dual U.S.-Lebanese\ncitizens may be subject to laws that impose special obligations on them.8\nThe threat of intelligence gathering by Hizballah and its agents remains a\nconcern. Such activities have extended beyond Lebanon\u2019s borders. In 2007, for\nexample, a Lebanese national and U.S. citizen pled guilty to charges of fraudulently\nobtaining U.S. citizenship. She later used that citizenship to gain employment at the FBI\nand CIA; accessing a federal computer system to unlawfully query information about\nher relatives and the terrorist organization Hizballah; and conspiring to defraud the\nUnited States.  Moreover, in 2008, a New Jersey man pled guilty to providing material\n9\nsupport to Hizballah by knowingly providing satellite transmission services to Al Manar.\nThe man admitted that he knew Al Manar was operated by Hizballah and that Hizballah\nhad engaged in acts of terrorism as defined by federal law.  \n10\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old translator/linguist who has worked for various defense\ncontractors since 2003. The eldest child of Lebanese parents, he was born in Kuwait.\nHe graduated from a Kuwaiti high school in 1981. In 1987, he came to the United\nStates to pursue post-secondary studies and learn the English language.  Applicant\n11\n\n Tr. 166. It is unclear which security application served as the basis for this previous SOR. The evidence\n12\nreflects that previous applications were completed and dated in January 2003, September 2003, January\n2004, August 2004, October 2004, and December 2004. See Ex. 3 (AJ Dec. ISCR Case No. 04-08867, dated\nMay 31, 2006) at 4. See also Ex. D (Applicant\u2019s SF86, dated Dec. 9, 2004). The application forming the basis\nof the SOR at issue in this case, dated March 2011, would be at least Applicant\u2019s sixth effort.\n Tr. 142-145.\n13\n Ex. 3, supra, note 12. The allegations under Guideline B were substantially the same as those raised in the\n14\ncurrent proceeding, with this proceeding adding consideration of a Lebanese friend, as noted below. The\nGuideline E allegations appear to have been based on issues concerning answers given regarding a foreign\npassport and foreign travel and the judgment those answers reflected, not the Guideline E issues presented\nin this case. Given the changes in Lebanon over the years in relation to Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts, the new\npersonal conduct issues, and the implementation of revised adjudicative guidelines that became effective in\nSeptember 2006,  the earlier decision\u2019s findings are not binding herein.\n4\n \nmarried in 1989 and relocated to a different part of the United States to continue his\nstudies. Applicant\u2019s parents joined him the United States in the early 1990s. Applicant\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1995. He divorced in 1998. Applicant\u2019s father died\nin 2001, while seeking U.S. citizenship. His mother became a U.S. citizen in 2003. \nApplicant never completed his college program. He worked his way up from\nhumble jobs to becoming a trucking service owner/operator from 1999 until 2002. He\nthen turned to linguistics. As a linguist, he has been deployed overseas four times to\nserve in his professional capacity. During one mission, Applicant was severely injured.\nHis first job was with Company X, where he worked from about October 2002 until\nAugust 2003. During that time, he was granted an interim clearance. When he\nresigned, he was eligible for rehire. He worked for another entity from October 2003\nuntil April 2004, then provided periodic service for yet another entity from September\n2004 through December 2004. From December 2004 until August 2006, he worked for\na subsidiary or subcontractor under the umbrella of Company X. \nAfter multiple subject interviews, a SOR was issued regarding Applicant\u2019s\napplication for a security clearance that noted security concerns arising under Guideline\nB, Guideline C, and Guideline E.  Applicant requested a hearing before a DOHA\n12\nadministrative judge. A hearing was convened, at which Applicant appeared with the aid\nof counsel.  In May 2006, the administrative judge issued a decision in which Guideline\n13\nB and Guideline C were found in favor of Applicant, but Guideline E was found against\nhim.  With regard to the adverse findings, the administrative judge found that at least\n14\none explanation provided by Applicant \u201cmakes little sense,\u201d that his omission of certain\ninformation during the investigatory process reflected \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d and that while\nthe record did not support a finding that Applicant\u2019s answers to another question lacked\nevidence that the omission was deliberate, there was evidence of \u201cquestionable\n\n Id. at 8-9. The administrative judge concluded his decision by noting, \u201cAn applicant is duty bound to be\n15\nforthright during all phases of the security investigation.\u201d\n Ex. 4 (App. Bd. Dec. ISCR Case No. 04-08867, dated Feb. 20, 2007).\n16\n Ex. Q (Supplemental submission, dated Aug. 17, 2011). The exact date of the denial varies. The SOR and\n17\nsome sources date the denial as May 31, 2006, the date of the administrative judge\u2019s adverse decision. A May\n15, 2008, letter from the Defense Security Service states that Applicant\u2019s security eligibility was denied on\nJune 8, 2006. Ex. G (DISCO letter, dated May 15, 2008).\n Ex. 1 (e-QIP, dated Sep. 9, 2009) at 42-43 of 51.\n18\n Ex. C (Applicant\u2019s Personal Subject Interview, dated Oct. 26, 2009). \n19\n5\n \njudgment.\u201d  The DOHA Appeal Board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision.  As\n15\n16\na result, Applicant was terminated from his job when his application for a security\nclearance was denied.   \n17\nUnemployed from August 2006 until April 2008, Applicant was then hired by his\npresent employer as a linguist. On September 9, 2009, Applicant certified as true his\nanswers to a security clearance application (e-QIP). In response to Section 25(b)(1) (To\nyour knowledge, have you EVER had a clearance or access authorization denied,\nsuspended, or revoked; or been debarred from government employment? If \u201cYes,\u201d give\nthe action(s), date(s) of action(s), agency(ies), and circumstances. Note: An\nadministrative downgrade or termination of a security clearance is not a revocation),\nApplicant answered \u201cYes.\u201d In the space provided, he noted, \u201cDate of action,\nmonth/year: 06/2006\" and wrote \u201cA misunderstanding of the the [sic] question that\nresulted in denial. It was not my fault as I was directed by [Company X] FSO to do so.\u201d18\nNo further comments clarified this statement. \nA lengthy personal subject interview was conducted under unsworn declaration\non October 26, 2009. The investigator reported Applicant\u2019s comments as follows: \nSubject answered the question about having a clearance or access\nauthorization denied, suspended or revoked incorrectly. Subject\nshould have answered the question no (discrepant) because the\nsubject left [Company X] voluntarily in August 2003[.] The subject\nbelieves his clearance was terminated because the subject was no\nlonger going to be working for [Company X]. The subject is not\naware of ever having a clearance denied, suspended or revoked or\nbeing debarred from government employment[.] The subject would\nhave had his clearance terminated when he left [Company X].  \n19\nIn an interrogatory signed on August 23, 2010, Applicant was asked at Item 32\n(Personal Conduct), \u201cYou failed to list your prior clearance denial on your current\nsecurity clearance application. Please indicate the reasons you failed to list your denial.\n\n Ex. 2 (Interrogatory, dated Aug. 23, 2010) at 21.\n20\n Id.\n21\n Tr. 149-151; Id. at 23. In his response to the SOR, however, Applicant denied that he was \u201cprovided with\n22\nan opportunity to review or comment upon what\u201d the investigator wrote in the summary. See SOR response,\ndated Apr. 28, 2011, at 2. Applicant later characterized the interviewer\u2019s underlying summary as \u201cvery\nambiguous.\u201d Tr. 166.\n Id.\n23\n Tr. 99.\n24\n Ex. 3, supra, note 12, at 7. To Applicant\u2019s distress, his two sisters in Lebanon do not regularly visit,\n25\ncommunicate, or maintain contact. He explained that in their culture, it is incumbent upon the younger siblings\nto make such efforts as a gesture of respect to the eldest sibling. Tr. 99-102. \n6\n \nFully explain.\u201d  Applicant responded by writing: \u201cI did not fail to list my prior clearance\n20\ndenial on my current security clearance application. I listed the denial on SF86 Section\n25, 1B, p. 43.\u201d  In swearing or affirming his answers, he also swore or affirmed that he\n21\nhad read the summary of the October 26, 2009, interview and \u201ceither found the\ninterview report to be accurate\u201d or added corrected information in the space provided.22\nLater, in responding to the SOR, he stated that he had not been provided with an\nopportunity to review the investigator\u2019s summary.  \n23\nAs noted, Applicant is the first-born child in his family. The second-born child in\nApplicant\u2019s family is a sister, who was born in Kuwait but is a citizen by birth of\nLebanon. A widowed homemaker, she is presently a resident and citizen of Lebanon\nwith four children. She does not maintain much contact with Applicant, a fact that hurts\nhim personally.  The third-born child is a sister who was born in Kuwait who similarly\n24\nhas maintained Lebanese citizenship since birth. She resides in Lebanon. She is a\nhousewife who contacts Applicant on holidays, but seldom at other times.  Her\n25\nhusband is an officer in the Lebanese Army. Applicant last saw this sister and her\nhusband after Applicant\u2019s father died in early 2001. The fourth-born child in Applicant\u2019s\nfamily is also a sister, who was born in Kuwait as a Lebanese citizen. She is now a U.S.\ncitizen who is married to a U.S. citizen. They have children who are U.S. citizens. \nApplicant\u2019s youngest sibling is a brother, who was also born in Kuwait as a\nLebanese citizen. The brother was preparing to seek U.S. citizenship when he was\ninvolved in a vehicular accident that resulted in an individual\u2019s death. He was\nimprisoned in the United States as a result of the death. He was deported to Lebanon in\n2010 after he completed his period of incarceration. The brother remains a resident and\ncitizen of Lebanon. His wife is a U.S. born citizen who lives in the United States with\n\n Tr. 104.\n26\n Tr. 101-104. Applicant described their relationship as \u201cnot good.\u201d Tr. 101.\n27\n The friend with whom Applicant once shared a teenage friendship now lives in Kuwait. Tr. 92. His residence\n28\nwas erroneously referenced as Lebanon at least once during the hearing. Tr. 71.\n Tr. 92.\n29\n Tr. 93-94. \n30\n Tr. 97.\n31\n Tr. 72-75.\n32\n7\n \ntheir child.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother has long been strained. The\n26\nbrother did not and does not respect his advice and familial authority.  \n27\nApplicant also has an acquaintance who resides in Kuwait, but who is a citizen of\nLebanon.  Applicant has referred to this male individual, whom he has known since\n28\nhigh school, as a \u201cfriend.\u201d They were in school together and, along with the boy\u2019s\nbrother,  played soccer together after high school. Applicant does not know much about\nthese peers\u2019 family.  The acquaintance\u2019s brother, however, is now a resident and\n29\ncitizen of the United States who maintains a security clearance.  Applicant and the\n30\nfriend\u2019s brother were roommates for a while when Applicant attended a U.S. college.\nThe friend, however, has never visited the United States. Over the years, Applicant has\ncomplained to his former roommate that the brother in Kuwait does not keep contact\nwith Applicant. This led to a telephone conversation in early 2011 with the former friend.\nDistance and years had increasingly affected their childhood friendship since Applicant\nmoved to the United States.  Applicant now considers this man to be a mere\n31\nacquaintance. A current close friend of Applicant\u2019s conveyed his impression that\nApplicant\u2019s childhood friend is now better termed an acquaintance with whom he once\nshared a past, but who is not a present friend.    \n32\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions, which are required in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.\nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n33\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n34\n Id.\n35\n Id.\n36\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n37\n8\n \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be and are considered in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching my\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence submitted.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n33\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n34\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n35\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n36\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n37\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance. Based upon consideration of the evidence, I\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n38\n Id.\n39\n9\n \nfind Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) to be pertinent\nto the case. Conditions pertaining to these guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n38\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  \n39\nIn May 2006, a DOHA administrative judge issued an adverse decision regarding\nApplicant that denied him a security clearance. The Defense Security Service (DSS)\nnoted the effective date of that denial as June 8, 2006. Consequently, Applicant lost his\njob with a subsidiary or subcontractor of Company X in August 2006. In an October 26,\n2009, interview, Applicant claimed that he was not aware of ever having had a security\nclearance denied, but only terminated (when he left a job with Company X in 2003). If\nthis explanation was intentionally false or misleading, it would be sufficient to raise\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). With a PC DC\npotentially raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s statements or representations of his statements regarding his past\nsecurity clearance status consist of the following:\n! May 2006 \u2013 After an SOR was issued and a hearing was held, a DOHA\nadministrative judge issued a decision denying Applicant a security clearance. That\ndecision was affirmed by the DOHA Appeal Board in February 2007.\n! May 2008 \u2013 DSS DISCO letter is issued to Applicant, referencing his 2006\nsecurity clearance denial.\n\n SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b.\n40\n Tr. 129-130. Applicant did not elaborate as to any other clearances.\n41\n Tr. 132.\n42\n Tr. 146-148\n43\n10\n \n! September 2009 \u2013 Applicant completed a security clearance application in\nwhich he noted a 2006 clearance denial that he described as having been based on the\nmisunderstanding of a question.\n! October 2009 \u2013 After discussing his past employment, including the time\nduring which Applicant first worked for Company X, Applicant gave a statement that led\nan investigator to note: \u201cThe subject is not aware of ever having a clearance denied,\nsuspended or revoked or being debarred from government employment.\u201d This\nstatement is not qualified in any manner.\n! August 2010 \u2013 Applicant referenced his September 2009 security clearance\napplication answer regarding a past clearance denial, but also adopted the October\n2009 investigator\u2019s summary without correction, qualification, or comment.\n! 2011 \u2013 The current SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s comments to the investigator\nwere deliberately false or misleading when he claimed that he had never had a\nclearance denied, but only terminated when he left his employment with Company X.\nRather, it notes that his prior security clearance application was denied as a result of\nthe adverse May 2006 DOHA administrative judge\u2019s decision.  In response, Applicant\n40\nimplied that he was previously denied the opportunity to review or comment on the\ninterviewer\u2019s summary. No reference is made to his adoption of that summary in 2010.\nHe wrote that the attributed comment was based on a misunderstanding.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing did not resolve the inconsistencies\npresented by the facts. He initially disclosed the 2006 denial in his September 2009\napplication, then, during the October 2009 interview, made the sweeping statement that\nhe was not aware of ever having had a clearance denied, suspended, or revoked. By\nway of explanation, he testified that there was confusion about his periods of\nemployment with Company X and its subsidiary/subcontractor, and the various forms of\nclearances he has maintained.  He asserted that the discrepancy is based on\n41\nmiscommunication.  He argued that the investigator\u2019s summary is incorrect, and that\n42\nshe \u201cmis-comprehended\u201d his statements during the lengthy interview.  However, he\n43\nadopted the summary, including his denial of a past clearance denial, without comment\nor objection in August 2010 - while incongruously referencing back to his initial\ndisclosure of a denial in his 2009 application. Moreover, in reference to the\ninvestigator\u2019s summary, he later stated in his response to the SOR that he had not been\nprovided with the opportunity to review or comment on the summary. Yet at the hearing,\n\n11\n \nhe acknowledged that he adopted the summary\u2019s contents when he completed the\n2010 interrogatory. \nWhile it is recognized that English is not Applicant\u2019s first language, he has been\nactively employed as a linguist by U.S. defense contractors for his translation and\ncultural expertise for many years. Moreover, he is not a novice with regard to the\nsecurity clearance process. Applicant has completed multiple security clearance\napplications. He has been interviewed by investigators more than once. It can be\nassumed that he also had previous experience completing interrogatories. He appeared\nbefore a DOHA administrative judge once before, and appealed the resultant decision.\nFurthermore, the adverse 2006 decision was based, at least in part, on issues related\nto incomplete answers or misunderstandings. Consequently, he knew or should have\nknown that full, frank, and candid answers are an integral part of this process. \nIn 2010, however, when given the opportunity to review and note any corrections\nregarding his October 2009 subject interview summary, Applicant adopted the summary\nas written. He did so without qualification or correction. This adoption included the\nunqualified statement that \u201csubject is not aware of ever having a clearance denied,\nsuspended or revoked.\u201d Given such an opportunity, a reasonable person would have\nthen noted any misstatements or registered any disputes about his broad statement if it\nwas untrue or incorrect. This is particularly true for an individual with considerable\nexperience in the investigatory and interview process. Consequently, I conclude that\nApplicant must have intentionally falsified or provided a misleading answer when he\nmade this representation during his interview. My conclusion is further bolstered by\nApplicant's denial in his Response to the SOR that he had not had an opportunity to\nreview and comment on the interview summary previously, when, in fact, it was shown\nat hearing that he had adopted the interview summary in his 2010 interrogatory. Given\nthese facts, neither Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual\nmade prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts), AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment), nor AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) apply.\nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply.\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence\nThe concern under Guideline B is that foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. The adjudication can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\n\n12\n \ncitizens to obtain protected information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe country at issue is Lebanon. Due consideration is given to those facts set\nforth above regarding that country. It is noted, however, that while the government of\nLebanon is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and is not\ndirectly associated with terrorist activity, it does recognize a foreign terrorist organization\n(Hizbollah) as a legitimate resistance group and political party. Hizballah and its\nassociates have been directly linked to terrorist activity and information gathering efforts\nwithin the United States. It is also recognized that the situation in Lebanon has not\nsignificantly improved since Applicant\u2019s family members were last examined by a DOHA\nadministrative judge in 2006, and that neither the presence of nor the threat\nrepresented by Hizballah has waned. Therefore, heightened scrutiny is warranted with\nregard to the admitted allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s relatives with citizenship and\nresidency in Lebanon (two sisters, brother, and brother-in-law who serves as an officer\nin the Lebanese Army). Those familial relationships, as well as his relationship with a\nLebanese friend living in Kuwait, give rise to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions\nAG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion) and AG \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information). With disqualifying conditions\nraised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns.\nDue in part to his siblings\u2019 resistance to give Applicant the deference and respect\nculturally extended to the eldest sibling and head of the family, Applicant does not\nmaintain close relationships with his foreign siblings. Applicant has two sisters who are\nresidents and citizens of Lebanon. His oldest sister is a widow and homemaker. They\nmaintain negligible contact. His next oldest sister is a homemaker married to an officer\nin the Lebanese Army. They only exchange perfunctory greetings on major holidays.\nApplicant\u2019s brother, who was incarcerated in the United States before being deported\nback to Lebanon, is also a resident and citizen of the Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s relationship\nwith his brother is \u201cnot good,\u201d and the facts indicate both that the two are estranged and\nthat the Applicant is unhappy with his younger sibling\u2019s failure to respect his authority.\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that any of these siblings are agents of a\nforeign power or is in a position to be exploited. Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition\nAG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.) and AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens\n\n13\n \nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation) applies to these three siblings. \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is an officer in the Lebanese Army. However, the two\nhave not seen each other since about 2001, after the death of Applicant\u2019s father.  Given\nthe perfunctory nature of communications between Applicant and the officer\u2019s wife, it\nmay be concluded that subsequent written or telephonic contact between Applicant and\nthe officer, if any, has been minimal. Applicant\u2019s position of vulnerability with regard to\nhis brother-in-law is minimal. Also at issue is a friend from Applicant\u2019s teenage years in\nKuwait. This individual is a citizen of Lebanon and a resident of Kuwait. Applicant\ncredibly depicted the natural disintegration of their relationship due to time and\ngeography. Applicant\u2019s depiction of this childhood friend clearly represents a casual\nacquaintance, an assessment supported by a current close friend of Applicant. With\nregard to this individual and Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty to or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) and, to a greater\ndegree, AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation) applies.  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the\nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an\noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and\nthe whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the whole-person factors.\nApplicant is a mature man with some post-secondary education and nine years\nexperience as a linguist. He immigrated to this country to pursue his education and\nrefine his English language skills. He is dedicated to his work. Applicant was wounded\non one of his four foreign deployment while in service to this country. When he\ncompleted the 2009 security clearance application, he had experience with the security\nclearance process, including the completion and certification of a security clearance\napplications, cooperating with investigators, and appearing at a DOHA hearing. This is\nthe second time Applicant\u2019s answers during the security clearance process have raised\nsignificant security concerns regarding personal conduct and his participation in the\nclearance application and investigation process. He knew the importance of actively\n\n14\n \ngiving detailed, accurate, and consistent answers to relevant questions, and the\nresponsibility of verifying those answers. \nWith regard to issues concerning foreign influence, despite the continued unrest\nin Lebanon and the growing influence of Hizballah, Applicant provided sufficient\ninformation regarding his foreign siblings, in-law, and childhood friend to mitigate\nforeign influence security concerns. He did so mainly by highlighting their increasingly\ncasual relationships and infrequent contact. He also demonstrated that those same\nfactors do not create a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\nWhat remains worrisome are issues regarding personal conduct and his\nreliability. In his September 2009 application, he indicated that he had a security\nclearance denied in 2006. Then in  October 2009, he recanted that information and\nstated that he was not aware of ever having a clearance denied \u2013 even though he had\nundergone an onerous process in 2006 that culminated in a 2007 Appeal Board\ndecision. Next, in August 2010, he incongruously reaffirmed his September 2009\nsecurity clearance application disclosure of a 2006 denial \u2013 yet adopted in whole\nwithout comment or correction the October 2009 interviewer\u2019s summary. Then in 2011,\nhe denied having been provided the opportunity to review the investigator\u2019s summary.\nLater, at the hearing, he acknowledged the interrogatory containing his adoption of that\nsummary.\nIt is possible that the interviewer was mistaken in her summary. Yet it was\nApplicant\u2019s responsibility to note any objections or mistakes in that summary when he\nwas given that opportunity in 2010. Rather than note any objections or cite to any\nmistakes at that time, however, he both adopted her summary and his denial of never\nhaving had a security clearance denied \u2013 never raising any issues regarding the\naccuracy of the summary. To now disavow that adopted summation as a simple\noversight seems self-serving. It also raises serious issues regarding judgment, candor,\nand reliability. \nI have duly considered all the exhibits and relevant facts in this case, including\nApplicant\u2019s familiarity and past issues with the investigatory and administrative hearing\nprocess, the past admonitions regarding the necessity of his providing full and candid\nanswers throughout that process, his linguistic fluency, his answers to relevant\nquestions, and his overall testimony. There is no evidence that Applicant is disloyal.\nHowever, his failure to consistently, fully, directly, and honestly provide clear answers to\ndirect questions sustains personal conduct security concerns. As noted, any doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of national security. Clearance is denied.\n\n As noted, supra, \u00b6 2.a was amended to incorporate the substance of the struck \u00b6 2.d.\n44\n15\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\n44\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance denied.\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant committed four alcohol-related driving offenses between 1991 and\n2009. He had about $12,000 in gambling-related debt discharged in a 2002 bankruptcy,\nand continues to gamble on a regular basis, while over his borrowing limit on a number\nof credit cards. He falsified his security clearance application concerning gambling-\nrelated problems. His previous security clearance was revoked for similar reasons in\n2004, yet the conduct continued. The evidence is insufficient to mitigate resulting\nsecurity concerns. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 9, 2009  On August\n1\n18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal\nJuly 6, 2011\n\nItem 1.\n2\nItem 3.\n3\nThe Government submitted 11 Items in support of the SOR allegations. \n4\nItem 4.\n5\nItem 3.\n6\nItem 6.\n7\n2\nConduct).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\n2\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective within the\nDepartment of Defense after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (AR) on September 3, 2009, and\nrequested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record\nwithout a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on\n3\nFebruary 8, 2011. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM)  was\n4\nprovided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the\nFORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non February 14, 2011, and returned it to DOHA. On February 28, 2011, he submitted a\nstatement objecting to Department Counsel\u2019s assertion that he continues to drink, and\nstating that he had not consumed any alcohol since April 2009. He did not request\nadditional time to respond, and expressed no objection to my consideration of the\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel. On March 7, 2011, Department Counsel\nindicated that she had no objection to my consideration of Applicant\u2019s response to the\nFORM. I received the case assignment on March 13, 2011.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has\nworked as a mail room and office services clerk since December 2001. He has no\nmilitary service. He was granted a security clearance in 1996, while employed by a\ndifferent defense contractor. His security clearance was revoked in August 2004, as\nfurther discussed below. He has never married, has no children, and lives with his\nmother in her home. He attended a vocational institute for three months in 1988.  In his\n5\nresponse to the SOR, he admitted each allegation.  Applicant\u2019s admissions, including\n6\nhis responses to DOHA interrogatories,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n7\n\nAR; Item 7; Item 10; Item 11; FORM Response.\n8\nAR; Item 4; Item 6; Item 9.\n9\nAR; Item 6; Item 8; Item 9.\n10\nThe SOR incorrectly alleges that Applicant certified his SF 86 on April 29, 2009, vice April 9.\n11\n3\nApplicant was arrested on April 22, 2009, and charged with Aggravated Driving\nWhile Intoxicated (DWI) First Offense, Speeding 21-25 miles per hour over the Speed\nLimit, and a traffic lane violation. The Aggravated DWI charge was later amended to\nDWI First Offense, of which Applicant was convicted on December 9, 2009, after\npleading guilty. The other two charges were then dismissed. After successful\ncompletion of a drug court program that included 11 months of treatment and\nsupervised probation, Applicant was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 89 days\nsuspended and the other day converted to 48 hours of community service, and fined on\nDecember 13, 2010. No details concerning the drug court treatment program were\nsubmitted by Applicant, but on February 28, 2011, he claimed to have consumed no\nalcohol since his April 22, 2009 arrest.8\nApplicant was also arrested and charged with DWI in September 2003. That\ncharge was dismissed for reasons that were not made part of the record. He was\narrested and charged with Reckless Driving and Eluding a Police Officer in September\n1998, when he drove after drinking alcohol. He pled guilty to Careless Driving, and was\nfined. He pled guilty to DWI after being arrested in August 1991, and received\nprobation. In December 2000 and May 2001, Applicant made threatening telephone\ncalls to a coworker and former coworker after drinking alcohol. He was terminated from\nhis previous employment as a result of the earlier call.  \n9\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in October 2001, listing total\nliabilities of more than $24,000. About half of this debt total represented borrowed funds\nthat Applicant lost while gambling. Applicant continued gambling on a regular basis after\nhis debts were discharged in January 2002, and still does so. In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in March 2009, he said that he still gambled monthly, spending $100\nfrom his salary, and that he no longer used credit card cash advances to gamble. His\ncredit report, obtained on February 19, 2009, reflected a revolving credit limit of $9,556\nand an outstanding revolving credit balance due of $10,557. None of the accounts were\nreported to be delinquent, however. His personal financial statement, submitted in\nMarch 2009, reported monthly net income of $2,000; monthly living expenses of $500; a\ntotal of $10,360 owed on seven different credit cards, and only $500 in bank savings.\nApplicant\u2019s only other asset was a car worth $17,800.   \n10\nWhen Applicant completed his most recent security clearance application, on\nApril 9, 2009,  he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 26.o, which asked whether he had \u201cEVER\n11\nexperienced financial problems due to gambling?\u201d. Applicant admitted that he\ndeliberately failed to disclose that half of the debt discharged in his 2002 bankruptcy\nwas gambling-related. He would reasonably be expected to understand the security\n\nItem 3; Item 4; Item 9: ISCR Case No. 02-33326 (August 12, 2004).\n12\nItem 5.\n13\n4\nsignificance of that information, since it formed one of the main reasons his prior\nsecurity clearance was revoked. He also would have known the security significance of\nfalsifying that answer since another major reason for the earlier revocation was his\ndeliberate failure to disclose material information in response to three questions on the\nSF 86 he submitted in February 2002. The DOHA administrative judge who revoked\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance in August 2004 found against Applicant on all allegations\nin that earlier SOR, under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), F (Financial\nConsiderations), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct).    \n12\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor is also his Facility Security Officer. His supervisor\nsubmitted a letter, dated September 3, 2009, stating that he had supervised Applicant\nfor over two years. He described Applicant\u2019s responsibilities as providing proficient,\ncourteous, and reliable support to all divisions and employees at their facility, and\nhandling all incoming and outgoing mail. He described Applicant as organized, efficient,\nextremely competent, and having excellent rapport with fellow employees, customers,\nand vendors. He concluded by saying that he highly recommended Applicant for a\nclearance because it would allow Applicant to better assist and support the security\ndepartment.  Applicant submitted no other evidence tending to establish good\n13\njudgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility,\ndemeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided without a\nhearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DC supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by Department\nCounsel is:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nApplicant\u2019s three arrests for DWI in 1991, 2003, and 2009, another alcohol-related\ndriving offense in 1998, and alcohol-related threatening telephone calls in 2000 and\n2001 establish a long, troubled pattern that supports substantial security concerns\n\n6\nunder AG \u00b6 22(a). Accordingly, the burden is shifted to Applicant to mitigate those\nsecurity concerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant was involved in four alcohol-related driving offenses and two other\nalcohol-related incidents for which he lost his prior job, over an 18-year period. The\nmost recent DWI offense was about two years ago, and occurred less than two weeks\nafter he submitted his present application for a clearance. None of these alcohol-related\nincidents were shown to have occurred under unusual circumstances. His choice to\ncontinue alcohol consumption, after the 2004 revocation of his security clearance based\nin part on his previous drinking problems, precludes a finding that such incidents are\nunlikely to recur. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation.\nApplicant asserts that he has not consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication\nsince April 2009, but insufficient time has passed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\n23(b), given the duration and nature of his history of alcohol abuse. Similarly, there is\nnot sufficient evidence to support mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) or (d). Applicant\nresumed drinking after each of his alcohol-related incidents until the most recent, and\nfailed to submit documentation of participation in counseling or treatment since then. He\nprovided no current favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or\n\n7\nsocial worker, and was under close drug court supervision and probation for all but the\nlast two months of his claimed period of abstinence.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns under the guideline for financial considerations are set out\nin AG \u00b6 18, which reads:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.  \nThe record evidence established security concerns under one Guideline F DC, as\nset forth in AG \u00b6 19: \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful\nattempt to stop gambling, \u201cchasing losses\u201d (i.e. increasing the bets or\nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling\nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family\nconflict or other problems caused by gambling.\nApplicant\u2019s discharged more than $24,000 in debt during his 2002 bankruptcy,\nabout half of which involved credit card cash advances used for gambling. He continues\nto gamble on a regular basis, but claims that he only spends $100 per month from his\nsalary in doing so. The credibility of this claim is undermined by his being at or over his\ncredit limit on seven different credit cards, with only $500 in savings despite a $1,500\nmonthly net surplus of income over living expenses. He further attempted to conceal\ngambling losses by denying gambling-related financial problems on his most recent SF\n86. This evidence raises substantial security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(i), thereby shifting\nthe burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n\n8\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant offered no evidence to support application of any of these MCs. He\ncontinues to gamble, and his financial situation supports the conclusion that he has\nborrowed more than $10,000 on credit cards and spends almost three-quarters of his\nnet income pursuing such activities. He offered no other explanation for how or where\nhe spent all those funds while paying no rent, living with his mother, and being fully\nemployed in his current position for almost ten years.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The potentially disqualifying condition alleged in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 26.o on his security clearance\napplication, which asked if he had ever experienced financial problems due to gambling.\n\n9\nHe admitted that he deliberately answered that question falsely. Furthermore, his prior\nsecurity clearance was revoked in August 2004 due, in significant part, to his\nfalsification of answers to three questions on his February 2002 security clearance\napplication. Serious security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a) were raised by these facts.\nApplicant offered no evidence that would tend to support any mitigating condition\nunder Guideline E. After careful review of the record, I find that none of them apply. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature,\naccountable adult who voluntarily chose to engage in the conduct of concern. This\nconduct has spanned the past twenty years, and continues to date. He committed his\nmost recent DWI in April 2009, shortly after applying for a security clearance that had\nbeen revoked in 2004 due, in part, to his earlier string of alcohol-related offenses. His\nclaimed period of abstinence since then was largely under the close supervision of a\ndrug court program. He continues to gamble regularly, and the evidence indicates that\nhis ongoing losses are substantially larger than he will admit. He falsified his current SF\n86 to avoid disclosing his gambling-related financial problems. Such losses, and\nfalsifying his previous security clearance application, were also significant reasons\nunderlying the revocation of his previous clearance. The likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence of irresponsible conduct and the ongoing potential for exploitation or duress\nhave not been refuted. Applicant did not demonstrate rehabilitation or other permanent\nbehavioral changes. His current supervisor\u2019s opinion that he would be a more valuable\nemployee if he was granted a security clearance is insufficient to establish his eligibility\nfor one.\n\n10\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption, financial\nconsiderations, and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA, Item 5), on\nNovember 7, 2007. He was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) on January 9, 2008. On December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline\nE). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nJuly 23, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 4, 2009. He requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on April 8, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on April\n20, 2009. His response was due by May 20, 2009. No response was received by\nDOHA. The case file was assigned to me on June 17, 2009. \nRulings on Procedure\nIn the last full sentence of Paragraph 2.a. of the SOR, there are references to\nsubparagraphs 2(a) through 2(j). Those references are incorrect. The references should\nbe to subparagraphs 1(a) through 1(j) of the SOR, which is the location of the omitted\naccounts. Another change is made in Item 7, containing Applicant\u2019s interrogatory\nanswers dated March 22, 2008. Interrogatory 3, page 4, of Item 7 is amended as\nfollows: the question is changed by inserting the date \u201cNovember 7, 2007,\u201d in place of\nJune 21, 2007; and by inserting the correct SCA question, \u201c28A (LAST 7 YEARS,\nOVER 180 DAYS DELINQUENT ON ANY DEBTS?),\u201d in place of \u201c38. Your Financial\nDelinquencies - In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Pursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive, the SOR is amended accordingly. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains nine allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nSOR 1.b. and 1.e. are the same account. SOR 1.f. is not reported in Item 9, the\ngovernment\u2019s recent credit bureau report, even though Applicant acknowledged the\ndelinquent account. The overdue debts are for a satellite television account, credit card\naccounts, and signature loans. The total amount of the debt is approximately $33,000.\nApplicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.i. He denied\nsubparagraphs 1.d., and 1.j. He also denied paragraph 2. (including subparagraph 2.a.)\nalleging an intentional omission of debts from his SCA dated November 7, 2007. He first\nrealized he had debt in 2005 when he encountered trouble purchasing a car (Item 6, 7).\nIn an attachment to his answer, Applicant provided an explanation for each of the\nlisted accounts. Three general explanations supplied were: (1) because of his extensive\ntravel, he would experience significant periods without adequate funds between travel\nreimbursements; (2) his wife bore responsibility for some of the delinquent debts; and,\n(3) Applicant has been caring for his mother and supporting two households. Applicant\nbelieves he should receive his security clearance because he served the country (U.S.)\nin the United States Army (USA) for 17 years, and received an honorable discharge in\nSeptember 1995. Since then, he has been employed for 13 years by defense\ncontractors. He has worked as a Technician 4 for his current contractor since October\n2007 (Item 4). \nApplicant is 49 years old. He was married in January 1985. He has been\nseparated from his wife since January 2003. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions to the\nSOR, I make the following factual assertions.\n\n3\nFinancial Considerations\nSOR 1.a., $300, satellite television. Applicant provided no documentation to\nsupport his claim (Item 4) that the delinquent part of the debt was paid, and the debt is\nin a current status. \nSOR 1.b., $4,144, signature loan. According to the credit reports (Items 8, 9), this\naccount became delinquent in October 2007. Applicant indicated he personally\ncontacted the accounting department of the creditor, and was informed the account was\nnot in the system. Applicant provided no documentation to support his assertions. \nSOR 1.c., $2,506, credit card. Applicant thought he paid the account (Item 4, 6),\nbut provided no documentation to prove how or when the account was paid. \nSOR 1.d., $18,389, Applicant explained that he was on deployment at the time\nwhen the leased automobile was repossessed. He mailed in the final payment. His wife\nthen returned the car to the lender (Item 4). Applicant told the lender he did not want to\nbuy the car, and does not believe he owes for the car (item 6, 7). He provided no\ndocumentation to show that he made his final payment or why he does not owe a\nbalance on the car, i.e., that he reached an agreement with the lender that he was\nreleased from liability. The credit reports (Items 8, 9) reflect the last car payment was in\nJune 2003. \nSOR 1.e., this is a duplicate entry of SOR 1.b., and is resolved in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor (item 8, 9). \nSOR 1.f., $3,246, credit card. Applicant provided no proof he paid the account\n(Item4). The last activity on this account is October 2002. The account does not appear\nin the most recent credit report (Item 9), and is probably unenforceable under the state\nstatute of limitations. The statute identifies the amount of time available for creditors to\nfile legal action to recover a debt. However, Applicant admitted he owes the account\n(Item 6). SOR 1.f. is found against Applicant. \nSOR 1.g., $214, unknown account type. Applicant claimed he was ahead of the\naccount\u2019s payment schedule, and eventually paid the account off (Item 4, 6). This\ndeclaration lacks documentary proof. \nSOR 1.h., $726, credit card. There is no verification for Applicant\u2019s claim of\nsatisfying the account (Item 6). \nSOR 1.i., $3,193, Applicant explained that he did not recognize this creditor. Yet,\nhe admitted the account (Item 4, 6). I find that Applicant still owes the account.\nSOR 1.j., $306, Applicant explained he was deployed at the time. He believed\nthe delinquent account is the responsibility of his wife (Item 4). Also, according to\n\n4\nApplicant, the relevant medical records may have been lost in a weather incident (Item\n6). Applicant furnished no documentation to support his claims. \nOn January 9, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. During\nthe interview, he acknowledged most of the debts listed in the SOR, and stated his\nintention to contact the creditors by January 31, 2008 (Item 6). The record contains no\ndocumentation of action taken. \nOn March 22, 2008, Applicant provided answers to interrogatories (Item 7)\nregarding the status of certain delinquent debts listed in the SOR, and action he\nintended to take to resolve the debts. Applicant furnished attached statements to five of\nthe listed creditors. In these statements, he reiterated his intentions to pay off some of\nthe creditors (Id.). Concerning SOR 1.c., Applicant supplied no verification that he made\nmonthly payments as he stated. He did not provide support for his claim of agreeing\nwith an official of the SOR 1.b. creditor to make payments. Regarding the creditor in\nSOR 1.h., Applicant claimed he resolved the debt in two payments of $236 (Item 4). The\npayment claims are unsubstantiated. \nPersonal Conduct\nOn November 7, 2007, Applicant certified and signed an SCA. In response to\nquestion 28A requiring information about debts more than 180 delinquent in the last\nseven years, he answered \u201cNo,\u201d even though he had six past due accounts over 180\ndays delinquent. In support of his denial of SOR 2.a., Applicant claimed that he was\ndeployed at the time the debts became delinquent, and his wife, from whom he has\nbeen separated since 2003 because of communication problems, should bear\nresponsibility for the debts (Item 4). I do not find his claim credible. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no independent evidence regarding his job performance or\nreputation in the community where he lives. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the variables listed in the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\n\n5\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nWhen Applicant furnished his SCA to the government in November 2007, he\nintentionally did not disclose he had debts over 180 days delinquent in the past seven\nyears. In January 2008, Applicant was interviewed about the listed debts and declared\nhe would check his credit report, then contact the creditors by January 31, 2008. The\nrecord contains no documentation to show he initiated action in support of his stated\nintention. In March 2008, Applicant provided attached statements to his interrogatory\nanswers reiterating the claims in his answers that he had made payments to some of\n\n Relevant documentation includes receipts from the creditor, on-line responses showing the status of an\n1\naccount proving payment had been processed, or Applicant\u2019s checking account statement disclosing checking\naccount activity. \n6\nthe listed creditors. There is no independent documentation,  e.g., from the creditor or\n1\ncollection agency or banking institution, that verifies Applicant made any payments on\nany of the bills. FC disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and, FC MC \u00b6 20.c. (the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control).\nFC MC \u00b6 20.a. does not apply because there are nine overdue accounts. Two of\nthe accounts became delinquent less than two years ago. In addition, Applicant\nintentionally lied about his delinquent debt history. His falsification and decision not to\nprovide documentation to strengthen his claims about paying the debts continues to\ncast doubt on his judgment and reliability. \nIn his SOR answer, his January 2008 interview, and his March 2008 interrogatory\nanswers, Applicant placed blame on his wife for his financial distress. Even if I accept\nApplicant\u2019s claim, I conclude that with the passage of time after his marital separation,\nspecifically in 2005 when he experienced trouble buying a car, Applicant should have\ndedicated more attention to his financial obligations. He receives no mitigation under FC\nMC \u00b6 20.b. Neither FC MC \u00b6 20.c. nor FC MC \u00b6 20.d. apply to the circumstances of this\ncase as there is no evidence of financial counseling, and no documented evidence of a\ngood-faith effort to repay the overdue creditors. Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting his\nfinancial obligations has not been mitigated. Accordingly, the FC guideline is found\nagainst him. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b6 15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThis guideline applies to intentional attempts to conceal or omit information from\nan SCA. I am unable to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under this guideline because he\n\n7\ndeliberately omitted all his delinquent debt from his SCA. PC DC \u00b6 16.a. (deliberate\nomission or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness) applies. Six of the nine listed\ndebts in the SOR are delinquent by more than 180 days. By falsely claiming he had no\npast due accounts, Applicant tried to deceive the government regarding his financial\nstatus. The most reasonable explanation for his omission was to enhance his chances\nof obtaining a security clearance. \nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC \u00b6 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC \u00b6 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC \u00b6 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). PC MC \u00b6 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant did not disclose his delinquent\ndebt history until after he was confronted with the debts in his January 2008 interview\n(Item 6, Interrogatory answers). PC MC \u00b6 17.c. is inapplicable because Applicant tried\nto conceal a large amount of delinquent debt owed to six of nine creditors. Applicant\u2019s\nintentional omission of material financial information in November 2007 continues to\ncast doubt on his reliability and judgment. Lastly, Applicant receives no mitigation under\nPC MC 17.d. because he still denies he deliberately falsified the SCA.  \nThough Applicant persists in his denial that he intentionally omitted material\nfinancial information from his SCA in November 2007, the number of delinquent\naccounts and the amount of the debt convince me he knew he had delinquent debt\nwhen he filled out the security form. His lack of candor in not admitting he intentionally\nconcealed the information warrants a finding against him under the PC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence utilizing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nof the FC and PC guidelines. Even though I have resolved both guidelines against\nApplicant, the case still must be weighed within the context of nine variables known as\nthe whole person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n8\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent financial history began in 2002 when he fell behind in\npaying the account set forth in SOR 1.f. After he separated from his wife in 2003\nbecause of communication problems, he should have interpreted that separation as a\nsign to pay closer attention to his financial accounts. Instead, the record shows he took\nno action to resolve the debts, even after he was confronted with them in January and\nMarch 2008, and even though he promised both times to obtain a credit report and/or\ntake action. Regardless of the explanations for his past due indebtedness, Applicant\n(age 49) has furnished no proof that he paid any of the listed creditors. The lack of\ndocumentation, the lack of character evidence, the lack of financial counseling, and\nApplicant\u2019s poor credibility, necessitates a finding against him under the FC and PC\nguidelines.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 15, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On March 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nDecember 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 4, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. On April 14, 2009, DOHA \nreceived his response. On May 5, 2009, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. \nOn May 7, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On May 14, 2009, DOHA issued a \nhearing notice scheduling the case for June 4, 2009. The hearing was held as \nscheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through O, which \nwere received without objection. I held the record open until June 19, 2009, and \nextended that date until June 24, 2009, to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documents. Applicant subsequently submitted AE P through X, which were \nreceived without objection. On June 18, 2009, DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant denied all allegations. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old staff engineer who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since August 2006. GE 1, Tr. 40, 107. Applicant seeks a security clearance \nas a first-time applicant. Applicant previously held an interim security clearance, which \nwas revoked as a result of these proceedings. Tr. 104-105. \n \nApplicant was awarded three separate associate degrees in electrical \nengineering, electrical technology, and telecommunications, dates uncertain. He was \nalso awarded several work-related certificates. GE 1, Tr. 40-41, 105-106. Applicant \nmarried in August 1986, and has no children. GE 1, Tr. 104. His wife is employed as a \nlicensed practical nurse. Tr. 109. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nSecurity concerns were identified during Applicant\u2019s background investigations \nstemming from three previous arrests in 2001, 2003, and 2006. None of the three \narrests led to a conviction. The related charges were subsequently dismissed. \nSummarized they are: \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n1. October 2001 \u2013 Applicant was arrested and charged with simple \nassault. Applicant arrived home and discovered his wife was intoxicated. \nAn altercation ensued, which lead to the arrest of both Applicant and his \nwife. The charges against Applicant were dismissed. Tr. 41-42, 49-68, GE \n2, GE 3, GE 4, AE T. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \n2. June 2003 \u2013 Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) simple \nassault, (2) unlawful possession of a weapon, and (3) threaten to kill. \nApplicant arrived home and discovered his wife was intoxicated. An \naltercation ensued, which lead to the arrest of Applicant. The Applicant \nentered a pre-trial intervention program and was ordered to undergo a \ndomestic violence assessment evaluation. The charge was subsequently \ndismissed in April 2004. Tr. 42-43, 68-80, GE 2, GE 4. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \n3. October 2006. Applicant was arrested and charged with simple assault. \nApplicant arrived home and discovered his wife was intoxicated. A dispute \nensued spanning a several day period ending in an altercation and \nApplicant\u2019s arrest. Applicant pleaded not guilty and enrolled in a domestic \nviolence abuse counseling program. He submitted an October 2007 letter \nfrom his case manager advising that he completed treatment and was no \nlonger being monitored. The charge was dismissed. Tr. 43, Tr. 80-93, GE \n2, GE 4, AE J. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a long history of alcohol abuse. After each of Applicant\u2019s \narrests, Applicant\u2019s wife received or participated in some form of treatment. She \nattended an inpatient detoxification program from January 14, 1997 to January 22, \n1997. She followed up with inpatient rehabilitation from January 22, 1997 to February 7, \n1997. She participated in 17 sessions and a follow-up intensive outpatient program from \nFebruary 13, 1997 to May 12, 1997, including 13 sessions. AE Q.  \n \nAfter the October 2001 incident, she was admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation \nprogram from October 25, 2001 to November 4, 2001. She voluntarily attended a \nresidential inpatient drug and alcohol treatment program from November 18, 2001 to \nFebruary 9, 2002. AE R, AE S. After the June 2003 incident, she attended a three-\nmonth alcohol rehabilitation program. Since the October 2006 incident, she has been \nseeing a psychiatrist. GE 2. Applicant testified that since these incidents, his wife has \n\u201cdiscovered religion,\u201d which he believes contributed to her no longer drinking. Tr. 43-44, \n103-104, 108. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife submitted a letter in which she discussed her long-standing \nstruggle with alcohol. She stated all of her husband\u2019s arrests occurred after she called \nthe police when she was drunk. She accused her husband (Applicant) of doing things \nhe did not do to get him out of the house so she could continue drinking. She accepted \nresponsibility for the \u201cmess\u201d she caused and is trying to do the right thing. She was \nbaptized two years ago as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and tries to live according to Bible \nprinciples. She stated her husband is an \u201chonest and loyal man.\u201d AE T. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant submitted a psychological evaluation completed in May 2009 that \naddressed Applicant\u2019s three arrests and marital conflict. The psychologist discussed \nApplicant\u2019s history and provided a favorable psychological assessment of Applicant \nstating that his past arrests stemmed from conflicts that originated and escalated as a \nresult of his wife\u2019s drinking. He added that since Applicant\u2019s wife has sought \nprofessional help and stopped drinking, these conflicts have stopped. The evaluation \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s mental health is good and that there is no evidence that \nApplicant cannot be trusted to follow the rules and regulations of his present position. \nAE N. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR further alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts \npertaining to his arrest record when he completed his November 2006 e-QIP. The \npertinent question is:  \n \nSection 23: Your Police Record For this item, report information \nregardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or \notherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C 3607. c. Are there currently any \ncharges pending against you for any criminal offense?;  \n \nto which Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to list \npending charges from his October 2006 arrest. Applicant annotated his e-QIP with \ninformation that he had been arrested in \u201c01/2004 (Estimated)\u201d for \u201ccivil simple assault.\u201d \nGE 1, p. 25. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his response was incorrect, but affirmatively and \nconsistently denied that he engaged in deliberate falsification. Applicant\u2019s explanation \nwas thoroughly explored at the hearing. Tr. 44-46, 49-103, 111. His explanation is \nperhaps best summarized in his signed, sworn post-hearing statement: \n \nThe first two arrests listed in the SOR occurred in October 2001 and June \n2003. Both charges were eventually dismissed. \n \nIn or around late 2005, I approached one of the corporate attorneys who \nworked with my employer, [former employer], and asked him for \nassistance in getting the record of these two arrests expunged. At that \ntime, it was common practice for company employees to receive personal \nservices from various departments (legal, accounting, travel, etc.) free of \ncharge. \n \nTo the best of my recollection, this attorney\u2019s name was [name of \nattorney]. [Attorney] told me that he would take care of the expungement, \nand that I would not be legally required to disclose the two incidents in the \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfuture. I believe he prepared the initial paperwork based on the information \nI provided. \n \nSeveral months later, the company fell on hard times and was forced to \ndrastically reduce its expenses. Our legal service and many other non-\nessential services were eliminated. [attorney] stopped all work and even \nfiled a lawsuit against the company to recover unpaid fees. \n \nWhen [former employer] went out of business, it was my understanding \nthat the expungement had been finalized before [Attorney] severed his \nrelationship with the company. I did not discover the expungement had not \nbeen completed until the arrests came up in my clearance investigation. \n \nIn an effort to track down [attorney] and verify the above, I recently \ncontacted an individual who used to work in [former employer]. She told \nme she thought that [attorney] might have retired and moved to the South. \n \nI then contacted the former President of [former employer], and asked him \nif he had any additional information about my expungement request. He \nstated apologetically that he remembered the request, but thought that it \nlikely fell through the cracks when the company began experiencing \nfinancial problems. He also stated that he did not want to open any \ncommunication with [attorney] because of the pending lawsuit. \n \nIn October 2006, I was arrested a third time as referenced in the \nStatement of Reasons. I was charged with simple assault, which I \nunderstood to be a civil charge as opposed to a criminal one. This charge \nwas also dismissed, but on the condition that I attend nightly meetings at a \nDomestic Violence Access Center (DVAC). \n \nThe next month, I filled out an e-QIP as part of my security clearance \napplication. In Section 23, I was required to provide information about my \npolice record. \n \nUnder Question 23(c), I was asked whether there were any charges \npending against me for any criminal offense. While I knew that the \nOctober 2006 charge was still technically pending because I had not yet \ncompleted my DVAC program, I believed that it was for \u201ccivil simple \nassault\u201d and therefore did not constitute a criminal offense. \n \nI checked with [senior security clerk] in the Security Office about this \nissue, and she confirmed that I only needed to disclose criminal charges. I \nhave already submitted a letter from [senior security clerk] confirming that \nher understanding of my answers was consistent with what I have \ndescribed above. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe lead Security Officer at [employer], [facility security officer], has also \nprovided a statement confirming that I disclosed the arrest to [senior \nsecurity clerk] when filling out my e-QIP. \n \nThe fact that I was not trying to withhold information about the 2006 arrest \nshould be clear from my response to Question 23(f). That question \nrequested information about \u201cany offense(s),\u201d which I interpreted to mean \ncivil as well as criminal offenses. I accordingly disclosed the 2006 incident, \nthough I listed the date of the offense as 01/2004 due to a simple mistake \nin my recollection. \n \nI did not list the 2001 and 2003 arrests under Question 23(f) because of \nthe advice I had received from [attorney]. It was my honest belief at the \ntime I completed the e-QIP that I was no longer required to disclose these \narrests for any reason. AE V. \n \nThe President of [former employer], senior security clerk, and facility security \nofficer from his current employer submitted statements lending support to Applicant\u2019s \nassertions. AE P, AE U, AE W, AE X.  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nTwo character witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The first witness was his \ncompany\u2019s manager of software engineering. She has held a security clearance for 22 \nyears and has known Applicant since he was hired in August 2006. She described \nApplicant as an important member of her team, and his performance is \u201cwell above \naverage.\u201d She stated that Applicant has \u201cgreat character,\u201d and that \u201c[p]eople look up to \nhim, go to him for advice. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d Tr. 20-21.  \n \n \nThe second witness was his company\u2019s director of software engineering for \ncommunication systems. She has held a security clearance for 31 years and has known \nApplicant since he was hired in August 2006. She described Applicant\u2019s performance as \n\u201coutstanding in his job duties.\u201d Tr. 30. She stated Applicant is \u201can honest and ethical \nperson. He\u2019s been forthright at work.\u201d Tr. 33. \n \n \nBoth witnesses were queried whether they were aware of Applicant\u2019s arrests and \nhis explanation for failing to accurately provide arrest information on his e-QIP. They \nconfirmed that they were aware of his arrests and accepted his explanation of the \nunderlying circumstances surroundings those arrests as well as his explanation for his \nfailure to list provide accurate arrest information on his e-QIP, discussed supra. Both \nwitnesses also stated Applicant is trustworthy and needs a security clearance for his \njob. Tr. 17-39. Both witnesses submitted reference letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf that \nreiterated and expanded on their testimony. They noted that his superb performance \nhas earned him a promotion, and that he has received incentive bonuses in 2007 and \n2008 that are reserved for a \u201cselect number of employees.\u201d AE G, AE H. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nApplicant submitted a total of ten reference letters, including the two letters \ndiscussed supra. They include former long-term colleagues and neighbors. All reference \nletters provide compelling comments regarding Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good \ncharacter, integrity, work ethic, and loyalty. They collectively endorse Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. AE A \u2013 AE I. Additionally, Applicant submitted a supervisor\u2019s \nmemorandum recommending him for promotion and performance evaluations for 2007, \n2008, 2009. His promotion recommendation and performance evaluations document \nconsistent and sustained above average performance with extraordinary potential for \nfuture service. AE K \u2013 AE M. \n \nApplicant earns approximately $92,000 a year, and owns his house free and \nclear. His house is valued at $450,000, and he has approximately $500,000 in checking, \nsavings, and investments for a total net worth of $950,000. Tr. 47. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for criminal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation that Applicant was arrested three \ntimes in 2001, 2003, and 2006: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nApplicant was arrested for three assault charges involving domestic violence. All \nthree charges were dismissed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) are applicable. Further review is \nnecessary. \nOf the five criminal conduct mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 32, two are \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is applicable given the circumstances that the assaults are unlikely to \nrecur. All arrests involved alcohol consumption by Applicant\u2019s wife. The effects of \nalcohol have had a mercurial affect on the behavior of Applicant and his wife. \nApplicant\u2019s wife of 23 years has a long history of admitted alcohol abuse. After \nundergoing various treatment programs, she has been able to maintain sobriety for \napproximately three years since the 2006 incident as a result of psychiatric treatment \nand religious involvement. Her alcoholism and bouts with drinking have been \naddressed. On Applicant\u2019s part, he has undergone court-ordered treatment after his last \ntwo arrests, and successfully completed those treatment programs. His case manager \nassigned to his 2006 arrest stated he is no longer being monitored as of October 2007. \nCourts of competent jurisdiction dismissed all three charges. \n \nThe record is void of any criminal involvement of any nature other than the \nincidents in question. Although not an excuse or exoneration for what happened, the \noffenses in question occurred when his wife was drinking heavily. Excessive alcohol \nconsumption is the cause or trigger of the domestic altercations. Applicant has \nexpressed remorse for his role in the altercations. His actions were clearly contrary to \nhis otherwise very law-abiding behavior and reputation in the community and at work. \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) applies. Applicant has fully complied with all court-ordered treatment, \nprograms. His case manager following his October 2006 arrest stated that he has \ncompleted his treatment and was no longer being monitored. Applicant has consistently \nmaintained superior performance. He has been awarded a promotion and bonuses. \nTwo of his supervisors testified on his behalf and spoke of his work ethic, honesty, \nintegrity, and contribution to the defense industry. Neighbors also spoke of his good \nneighbor qualities.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nIn November 2006, Applicant provided an e-QIP which asked whether Applicant \nhad any pending arrests. Applicant incorrectly responded \u201cNo,\u201d and disclosed in the \nremarks section that he had been arrested for \u201ccivil simple assault\u201d in January 2004. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply because he provided an incorrect answer about his \npending arrest. Further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant consistently stated when he completed his e-QIP that he believed his \nmost recent arrest was a civil matter and that he conferred with company security \nofficials before submitting his e-QIP. He stated his imprecise date applied to his most \nrecent and pending arrest. Not alleged under this concern, Applicant also stated that he \ndid not list his first two arrests based on advice given to him by a previous company \nattorney. All of Applicant\u2019s assertions were subsequently corroborated. Applicant \nacknowledged his answer was incorrect, but added that there was no intent on his part \nto deliberately falsify his e-QIP. Of note, he listed an assault, albeit without an accurate \ndate, referring to his 2006 arrest putting the government on notice that he had an arrest \nrecord for assault.  \n \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately. An omission of relevant and \nmaterial information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, \ninadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the \ninformation did not need to be reported. He was candid and forthright at his hearing \nabout his arrests. In evaluating his testimony, I note his memory has faded over time, \nnot only with regard to details surrounding his arrests, but also background information \nsuch as graduation dates.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence strongly supports the notion that he is an honest \nindividual. Also persuasive was the testimony of his two supervisors, who stated that \nthey believe Applicant to be an honest person and they accept his explanation \nregarding his failure to disclose his past arrests accurately. I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nalleged falsification of his e-QIP is mitigated. Although he provided incorrect information \non his November 2006 e-QIP, AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies. The falsification allegations are \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nnot substantiated. I am satisfied he did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose \nhis 2006 arrest with intent to deceive.2  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. The \narrests for domestic assault, whether or not they were dismissed is a serious concern. \nGiven the alcohol history of Applicant\u2019s wife, Applicant should reasonably have been put \non notice that her drinking could lead to problems. When Applicant\u2019s wife drank, her \ntrack record demonstrated the situation could escalate to a physical altercation. \nUnfortunately, this set of facts led to Applicant being arrested three times for assault. \nThese factors show a certain level of culpability and lack of judgment on Applicant\u2019s \npart.  \n \n \n2The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). He is well regarded by his neighbors and is a contributing member of \nsociety. He owns his home free and clear and has a net worth of approximately \n$950,000. His work performance record is flawless and he is held in high esteem by his \nsupervisors and co-workers. Apart from these arrests, he is a law-abiding citizen and is \na contributing member of society. He has complied with all court-ordered treatment and \nhis wife has stopped drinking for approximately three years. Because of the change in \ncircumstances, it is unlikely that the offenses will recur. Further, because of his law-\nabiding character, it is unlikely any criminal offenses will recur. His psychological \nassessment provides for a favorable prognosis. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s incomplete and incorrect descriptions of his past arrests placed his \ncredibility into question. The government relies on each applicant for a security \nclearance to thoroughly and accurately respond to questions asked on a security \nclearance application. Information applicants provide forms the basis to grant or deny \nsecurity clearances. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide accurate and complete information \nrequired further costly and time consuming inquiries that could have been avoided. \nFortunately for Applicant, his lack of due diligence was not imputed to be intentional or \ndeliberate. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \ncriminal and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE J:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJonathan Bell, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On September 29, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nI (Psychological Conditions) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 25, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\n\nof the mitigating conditions; whether the Judge erred in his whole-person analysis; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nApplicant is a 26-year-old project coordinator for a Federal contractor.  Despite a normal\nchildhood, in her preteen years Applicant began feeling depressed, suffering from headaches, and\nwithdrawing from friends and family.  Additionally, she began acting out, setting small fires 10 to\n15 times, in trash cans, construction sites, etc.  She also spray-painted a police car and stole a key\nto a police gun cabinet.  At age 14, while working as a hospital volunteer, she set fire to a mattress\nin a stairwell.  She was arrested and served juvenile detention from June 1999 to March 2001. While\nundergoing detention, she received psychological counseling and attended anger management\nclasses and group therapy.  She was diagnosed with depression and treated with medication.\nUpon release, Applicant continued psychological counseling, from March 2001 to August\n2001.  Upon completing the court-ordered counseling, Applicant decided, along with her parents,\nto pursue counseling no further.  Although her psychologist died in 2006, the psychologist\u2019s spouse,\nwho is also a psychologist, reviewed the treatment notes and gave it as her opinion that her husband\nwould have diagnosed Applicant with pyromania, a disorder of impulse control.  The psychologist\nsaid that Applicant\u2019s prognosis would have been \u201cguarded\u201d as of August 2001, but that more recent\nevaluation could modify the prognosis.\nAs part of the investigation of her request for a trustworthiness designation, Applicant\nsubmitted to a psychological evaluation from a DOHA-selected psychologist (A).  Among other\nthings, A stated that Applicant \nattempts to present a social[ly] acceptable appearance, particularly to those in\npositions of  authority . . . [She] tends to minimize or cloak her psychological issues\n. . . I have questions regarding her current psychological status . . . The data suggest\nthat her affect states may not be stable, but rather superficial and charged with\nrapidly changing feelings . . . I would have reservations putting [Applicant] in a\ndelicate position of trust.  Decision at 3, quoting Government Exhibit 5.\nHe diagnosed Applicant as having a \u201chistrionic personality disorder with narcissistic personality\nfeatures.\u201d\nApplicant obtained two psychological assessments of her own, one by a psychologist (B) and\nanother by a psychiatrist (C).  The former concluded that Applicant showed an absence of histrionic\nfeatures and no symptoms of narcissism.  The Judge stated that B did not indicate whether she\nconsidered the treatment notes regarding Applicant\u2019s court-required counseling.  \nC has experience in evaluating applicants for security clearances and assignment to sensitive\npositions.  He reviewed the 2001 treatment notes and the assessment of those notes by the\npsychologist\u2019s wife, described above.  There is no indication that he considered the assessment by\nthe DOHA-selected psychologist. C concluded that Applicant is not suffering from a personality\ndisorder that would affect her ability to perform in a position of trust.  He stated that evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s rehabilitation is \u201cstrong.\u201d  Decision at 5, quoting Applicant Exhibit B.\n\n1Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 29(a): \u201cthe identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan[.]\u201d\n2Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 29(b): \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for\na condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional[.]\u201d  \n3Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 29(c): \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by,\nor acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in\nremission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation[.]\u201d  \n4Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 29(d): \u201cthe past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one caused by\ndeath, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of\nemotional instability[.]\u201d  \n5Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 29(e).  \nApplicant has received numerous accolades for the quality of her work performance.  Her\nsupervisor testified that Applicant has not exhibited any behavior on the job consistent with the\npersonality disorder found by the DOHA-selected psychologist. She enjoys a good reputation for\ndependability, efficiency, self-reliance, and for her work ethic.\nIn examining the mitigating conditions, the Judge stated that Applicant has no ongoing\ntreatment plan,1 that she has never voluntarily sought counseling,2 that the only mental health\nprofessional engaged by the U.S. Government expressed doubts about placing Applicant in a\nposition of trust,3 and that Applicant\u2019s problems were not a temporary condition and it is not clear\nwhether they have been resolved.4  On the issue of whether \u201cthere is no indication of a current\nproblem,\u201d5 the Judge stated the evidence is conflicting.  He noted that none of the professionals\ninvolved testified in person and, therefore, they were not subject to cross-examination, \u201cmaking it\nimpossible to ask them which diagnostic criteria, if any, they found applicable to Applicant and what\nthey relied on to conclude that each of the criteria was or was not applicable.\u201d  Decision at 9.  In his\nwhole-person analysis, the Judge stated, among other things, that \u201cthe psychological evidence that\nshe has overcome her earlier psychological problems is conclusory and untested by cross-\nexamination.  The inconclusive state of the evidence requires me to resolve the doubt in favor of\nnational security.\u201d  Decision at 10      \nApplicant challenges the following statement in the Analysis portion of the decision: \u201cNone\nof the medical professionals except the DOHA-selected psychologist [A] appear to have considered\nApplicant\u2019s entire medical record.\u201d  Applicant points to the following, in Government Exhibit 5,\nwhich is the report by A: \u201cThis examiner did not receive a complete set of records.\u201d  On its face this\nstatement contradicts the challenged statement by the Judge.  However, his overall decision appears\nto be that, because none of the professionals were subject to cross-examination, and neither B nor\nC state that they actually read A\u2019s report, the record evidence is not sufficient to resolve doubts\nraised by the conflicting evidence, doubts which must be resolved in favor of the national interest.\nWe conclude that, even if he had not make the error in question, the Judge would have decided the\ncase in the same way.  Therefore, the error in harmless. \nReading the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole, we are not able to conclude\n\nthat the Judge erred in his denial to Applicant of a trustworthiness designation.  It is clear that the\nreports of the two professionals engaged by Applicant disagree with that of the DOHA-selected\nprofessional.  However, neither B nor C provide any insight into what deficiencies, if any, may have\nbeen present in A\u2019s examination.  There is no record evidence addressing possible errors in A\u2019s\nanalysis or in the manner in which he tested Applicant and interviewed her.  Insofar as Applicant\nhas the burden of persuasion as to mitigation, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is consistent with the\nstate of the record that was before him.\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an application for a public trust position on February 1, 2008. \nOn September 29, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline I. DOHA acted under \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 5, 2010; answered it on October 7, 2010; \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nOctober 8, 2010. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 21, 2010, and \nFebruary 25, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe case was assigned to me on November 3, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non November 9, 2010, scheduling it for December 1, 2010. Applicant retained a lawyer, \nwho entered his appearance on November 23, 2010, and requested additional time to \nprepare. I granted his request, and DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing on \nDecember 1, 2010, rescheduling the hearing for December 16, 2010. I convened the \nhearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of two \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 27, 2010. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took \nadministrative notice of the relevant provisions of the American Psychiatric Association, \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., 2000) (DSM-IV).1 \nExtracts of the relevant provisions of DSM-IV are attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibit I. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old project coordinator employed by a federal contractor. \nShe has worked for her current employer since February 2008.  \n \n \nApplicant had a normal, happy childhood until her preteen years, when she \nstarted feeling depressed, suffering from migraine headaches, and withdrawing from \nfriends and family. She started acting out, associating with the wrong people, \nshoplifting, setting small fires 10-15 times in places like trash cans and construction \nsites, and trying to \u201clook cool and impress other people.\u201d She also spray-painted police \ncars and stole a key to a police gun cabinet. (Tr. 29-30, 49.) At age 14, while working as \na volunteer in a hospital, she set fire to a mattress in a stairwell, which led to her arrest \nand detention. She was in juvenile detention for arson from June 1999 to March 2001. \nShe testified she attempted suicide twice while in detention. (Tr. 65.) She received \npsychiatric and psychological counseling, anger management classes, and group \ntherapy while she was in detention. She was diagnosed with depression and treated \nwith mood stabilizers and antidepressants. (GX 5 at 1-2.) \n \n \nAfter being released from detention, Applicant was required to continue with \npsychological counseling. She was treated by a psychologist from March 2001 to \nAugust 2001. Her treatment record reflects 17 visits. It contains progress notes but no \ndiagnosis. The last progress notes dated August 28, 2001, note that Applicant \u201cis doing \nmuch better overall,\u201d and they end with a notation reflecting a follow-up visit in one \nweek. (GX 4 at 26.) There were no further visits with this psychologist.  \n \n                                                          \n1  DSM-IV is cited in one of the psychological evaluations received in evidence (AX A). The relevant \nprovisions of DSM-IV are unchanged in the more recent DSM-IV-TR. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist died in June 2006. In August 2008, her psychologist\u2019s \nspouse, also a psychologist and her deceased husband\u2019s partner at the same \ncounseling center, reviewed her husband\u2019s progress notes at DOHA\u2019s request, and she \nconcluded that Applicant would have been diagnosed by her husband with pyromania \nand dysthymic disorder. According to DSM-IV, the essential  feature of pyromania is \n\u201cthe presence of multiple episodes of deliberate and purposeful fire setting.\u201d The \nessential feature of dysthymic disorder is \u201ca chronically depressed mood that occurs for \nmost of the day more days than not for at least 2 years.\u201d The psychologist explained \nthat pyromania is a disorder of impulse control, which could impair judgment or \nreliability. She concluded that Applicant\u2019s prognosis would have been \u201cguarded\u201d as of \nher last visit in August 2001, recognizing that a more recent psychological evaluation \ncould modify that prognosis. (GX 4 at 6.)  \n \nAfter completing the counseling required by the juvenile court, Applicant decided, \nafter consulting with her parents, that she did not need further counseling. She stopped \ntaking the medication for depression, because it was causing her to gain weight. (Tr. 35-\n36.)  \n \n \nApplicant returned to high school, took a night course and a correspondence \ncourse to catch up, and completed high school in June 2002. She began doing \nvolunteer work with her church and working part time during the school year. She \ngraduated from college cum laude in August 2006 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political \nscience. (Tr. 36-37.) She worked as an intern in a federal government agency from \nJanuary to April 2006. (GX 1 at 7; GX 2 at 5; AX B; Tr. 74.) \n \n \nApplicant started working for her current employer as a low-level administrative \nassistant. She was soon promoted to be an executive assistant, and was then promoted \nto be a project coordinator, her current position. (Tr. 39-40.) After Applicant submitted \nher application for a public trust position, a DOHA-selected psychologist evaluated her \nin May 2009. This psychologist made the following clinical findings: \n \nThe profile obtained suggests that [Applicant] attempts to present a social \nacceptable appearance particularly to those in positions of authority. She \nis a very outgoing and affable young woman who tends to minimize or \ncloak her psychological issues. I find this troubling given the amount of \npsychotherapy she has in the past. Test findings portray a woman who at \ntimes can be over-reactive and one who tends to seek out experiences \nthat might be considered capricious and immature in nature. I have \nquestions regarding her current psychological status. She seems prone to \nseek out a self-indulgent life-style and appears to lack a level of insight \ninto her deeper emotional complexities. The data suggest that her affect \nstates may not be stable, but rather superficial and charged with rapidly \nchanging feelings. Signs of inner turmoil or weakness are almost \ncustomarily denied or downplay[ed]. Unfortunately based on the findings I \nwould have reservations putting [Applicant] in a delicate position of trust. I \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwould recommend that she revisit the idea of starting therapy to complete \nthe work she had begun while learning to face her difficulties head on. \n \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with histrionic personality disorder2 with \nnarcissistic personality features3. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant testified that she spent a total of \nabout one hour with this psychologist, most of the time while taking a test on a \ncomputer. She talked with the psychologist 15 to 30 minutes. (Tr. 44.) \n \n \nIn November 2010, Applicant sought a second opinion from another psychologist \nregarding the May 2009 diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder with narcissistic \npersonality features. This psychologist recited the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and \nconcluded that Applicant showed a total absence of histrionic features and no \nsymptoms of narcissism. She described Applicant as \u201ca normal, well-adjusted young \nadult who demonstrates none of the character traits that might make her a security risk.\u201d \n(AX A at 1-2.) The psychologist did not recite the factual basis for her conclusion that \nnone of the diagnostic criteria were met. Applicant testified that this psychologist also \nadministered a test, which Applicant completed at home, followed by two face-to-face \nconsultations, each lasting 60 to 90 minutes. (Tr. 45-46.) There is no indication that this \npsychologist considered the 2001 treatment notes or the August 2008 assessment \nbased on those notes. \n \n \nIn December 2010, Applicant obtained another evaluation from a psychiatrist \nexperienced with evaluating applicants for security clearances and assignment to \nsensitive positions. He reviewed the 2001 treatment notes and the August 2008 \n                                                          \n2 The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder are: a pervasive pattern \nof excessive emotionality and attention seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of \ncontexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: (1) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or \nshe is not the center of attention; (2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate \nsexually seductive or provocative behavior; (3) displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of \nemotions; (4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self; (5) has a style of speech \nthat is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail; (6) shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and \nexaggerated expression of emotion; (7) is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances; \n(8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. \n \n3 The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder are: a pervasive pattern of \ngrandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early \nadulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: (1) has a \ngrandiose sense of self-importance (e.g. exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be \nrecognized as superior without commensurate achievements); (2) is preoccupied with fantasies of \nunlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love; (3) believes that he or she is \u201dspecial\u201d and \nunique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or \ninstitutions); (4) requires excessive admiration; (5) has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable \nexpectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations; (6) is \ninterpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends; (7) lacks \nempathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others; (8) is often envious of \nothers or believes that others are envious of him or her; (9) shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or \nattitudes. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nassessment based on those notes, but there is no indication that he considered the May \n2009 assessment. His conclusions were: \n \nIt is my professional opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that \n[Applicant] is a mature, honest, and serious employee, who is \ndedicated to her job and her country, and who can be counted upon \nto think and act rationally and responsibly in case of a crisis. She is \nnot suffering from a personality disorder that would affect her ability \nto safeguard classified information. So much time has elapsed \nsince the criminal behavior of her adolescence that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or \nsound judgment. There is strong evidence of successful \nrehabilitation from the unlawful and self-punitive behaviors of her \nearly adolescence.  \n \nAX B at 3. Applicant testified that she had two meetings with the psychiatrist, each \nlasting about one hour. (Tr. 46-47.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal for February 2008-February 2009 rated her as \nexceeding expectations in six elements of technical knowledge and meeting \nexpectations in two elements. It rated her as exceeding expectations in  seven elements \nof professional skills and meeting expectations in two elements. (AX D at 4-5.) Her most \nrecent appraisal for the period ending in February 2010 rated her as exceeding \nexpectations in all elements of technical knowledge and exceeding expectations in all \nelements of work management except one, for which she was rated as meeting \nexpectations. (AX D at 6-7.) She has received several accolades for her performance, \ncommenting on her dependability, attention to detail, enthusiasm, analytical skills, and \nleadership. One of her supervisors described her as one of their superstars. (AX D at 1-\n3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current first-line supervisor testified that Applicant has continued her \nexemplary performance and has become her supervisor\u2019s \u201cright hand person.\u201d (Tr. 94.) \nThe supervisor testified that Applicant is extremely reliable and dependable. She does \nnot act impulsively and has no problems with persons in authority. (Tr. 102-03.) \nApplicant\u2019s counsel read aloud each of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for histrionic \npersonality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, and asked her supervisor if \nApplicant exhibited any of them. Her supervisor answered in the negative for each of \nthe criteria, admitting on cross-examination that she was not a qualified medical \nprofessional (Tr. 97-100, 104.)  \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s friends describe her as dependable, efficient, competent, \nand \u201ca reliable, natural born leader who is never afraid to take on responsibility and \nholds her integrity at the forefront of all her actions.\u201d (AX E at 1-2, 4.) Applicant\u2019s aunt \nand uncle, who are aware of her problems during adolescence, describe her as hard \nworking, self-reliant, and compassionate. (AX E at 5.) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified that Applicant had a normal childhood, was a good \nstudent, and actively involved in childhood activities. When Applicant was in junior high \nschool, she became withdrawn and uninterested in outside activities. After Applicant \ncompleted her detention and the six months of counseling required by the juvenile court, \nshe and her parents discussed whether she could continue to receive counseling. Her \nparents had noticed that she had changed and was again involved in outside activities. \nThey decided to stop the counseling, with the understanding that it could be resumed if \nApplicant showed any signs of regression. When Applicant returned to high school, she \ncontinued to be a good student and was inducted into the National Honor Society. She \nwas awarded a college scholarship and worked part time in college to help support \nherself. She was on the fencing team in college and she continues to maintain a high \nlevel of physical fitness. She has an excellent relationship with her mother and her \nsiblings. (Tr. 113-24.) \n \n \nApplicant is a member of a local fencing team, a community emergency \nresponse team, a local volunteer fire department, and a local volunteer fire and rescue \nsquad. (AX C at 2, AX F; Tr. 40.) Her fire chief describes her as \u201ca hard worker who \nconsistently displays integrity, enthusiasm, commitment and responsibility.\u201d (AX E at 3.) \nThe volunteer coordinator for the community emergency response team describes her \nas \u201cextremely committed, dependable, thorough, interested in helping the community \nand in doing the right things right.\u201d (AX E at 6.) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that \u201cthe person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Department of \nDefense contractor personnel are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive \nbefore any final unfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction an evaluation of the whole \nperson. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government \nmust present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by \nsubstantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor him or her eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant received mental health treatment from June 1999 to \nMarch 2001 while incarcerated for arson (\u00b6 1.a); and that she received mental health \ntreatment from March 2001 to August 2001, was diagnosed with dysthymic disorder and \npyromania (\u00b6 1.b), and received a \u201cguarded\u201d prognosis (\u00b6 1.c). It also alleges that in \nMay 2009 she was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder with narcissistic \npersonality features, with a recommendation that she return to therapy (\u00b6 1.d). Finally, it \nalleges that as of December 2009, Applicant was not undergoing any mental health \ntherapy or treatment and not taking any medications (\u00b6 1.e). \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to Guideline I is set out in AG \u00b6 27:  \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 sets out the three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but \nnot limited to emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, \nparanoid, or bizarre behavior; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and  \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a \ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take \nprescribed medication. \n \nApplicant\u2019s detention for arson, the diagnosis of pyromania based on her \npsychological counseling in 2001, and the diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder \nand narcissistic personality disorder by a DOHA-selected psychologist are sufficient to \nestablish AG \u00b6 28(a) and (b). The disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 28(c) is not \nestablished by the notation on the psychologist\u2019s progress notes about a follow-up in \none week, because the record does not reflect whether the notation was a treatment \nrecommendation or a mere expectation that Applicant would return for further \ncounseling. However, Applicant\u2019s decision, in consultation with her parents, to stop \ntaking her medication for depression establishes AG \u00b6 28(c).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe identified \ncondition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(a). The first prong \nof this mitigating condition is established, because the psychologist\u2019s evaluation in 2001 \nindicated that Applicant was responding to treatment. However, the second prong is not \nestablished because Applicant has no ongoing treatment plan. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered \na counseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(b). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s initial counseling was involuntary, she has never \nvoluntarily sought or received counseling, and she is not currently receiving counseling \nor treatment. \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by a \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified \nmental health professional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment that an individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and \nhas a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(c). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because the one qualified mental health professional \nengaged by the U.S. Government expressed doubt that her previous condition is under \ncontrol and expressed reservations about placing Applicant in a position of trust. \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe past emotional instability was a \ntemporary condition (e.g., one caused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability. AG \u00b6 29(d). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \npsychological problems were not a temporary condition and it is not clear whether her \nprevious problems have been resolved. \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthere is no indication of a current \nproblem.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(e). The evidence is conflicting on this point. A psychologist, a \npsychiatrist, and Applicant\u2019s supervisors describe her as fully rehabilitated and an \nexemplary employee. On the other hand, the 2001 diagnosis found severe disorders \nand gave a \u201cguarded\u201d prognosis. The DOHA-selected psychologist described Applicant \nas a person who minimizes or cloaks her psychological issues, lacks insight into her \nemotional complexities, and denies or downplays her inner turmoil or weakness. None \nof the medical professionals except the DOHA-selected psychologist appear to have \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s entire medical record. The psychological and psychiatric \nassessments from May 2009, November 2010, and December 2010 are conclusory and \nlacking in detail. None of the medical professionals who provided evidence testified in \nperson, making it impossible to ask them which diagnostic criteria, if any, they found \napplicable to Applicant and what they relied on to conclude that each of the criteria was \nor was not applicable. Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nshe has not met her burden of establishing AG \u00b6 29(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent, articulate, intensely driven young adult. She has been \nvery successful in her current job. Her employers believe she has overcome her past. \nWhile it is possible that she has overcome her psychological problems without \nprofessional help since 2001, some of the psychological evidence, albeit untested by \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncross-examination, suggests that she may be simply masking her psychological issues. \nThe psychological evidence that she has overcome her earlier psychological problems \nis conclusory and untested by cross-examination. The inconclusive state of the \nevidence requires me to resolve the doubt in favor of national security.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on psychological conditions. \nAccordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position. Eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant answered the SOR 10 February 2009, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 2 April 2009, and I convened a hearing 14 May\n2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 22 May 2009.\n \nMay 29, 2009\n\nUnder Jordanian law, a citizen may neither lose Jordanian citizenship nor acquire another nationality without\n2\nthe consent of the Board of Ministers. The law provides for voluntary renunciation, requiring an application,\nfee, and ultimate approval of the Board of Ministers.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 39-year-old senior computer\nengineer employed by a defense contractor since February 2007. He has not previously\nheld a clearance.\nApplicant was born in Libya in April 1970.  His father was a bank manager for a\nMiddle Eastern bank, working in Libya on a work visa; his mother was a homemaker.\nBoth parents were born in the West Bank, territory now occupied by Israel, but at the\ntime it was part of the semiautonomous Emirate of Transjordan under the British (father)\nor the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan after 1946 (mother). In any event, both\nparents were Jordanian citizens, and Applicant obtained Jordanian citizenship by\ndescent through his father. When he was six months old, Applicant returned to Jordan\nwith his parents and was raised and educated there until 1984 (age 14), when he\nmoved with his parents to the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), where his father had been\nposted with the bank. In 1988 (age 18), he came to the U.S. to attend college. He has\nresided permanently in the U.S. since then. His parents immigrated to the U.S. in 1996,\nafter his father retired from the bank. They have resided permanently in the U.S. since\nthen.\nApplicant attended college in the U.S., and received his undergraduate degree in\nengineering in 1994. In January 1995, he married a naturalized U.S. citizen who\nimmigrated to the U.S. with her parents when she was six months old and became a\nU.S. citizen (as a minor child) when her parents were naturalized in December 1988.\nThey have three children, all native-born U.S. citizens, who acquired Jordanian\ncitizenship by descent through their father under the same law that conferred Jordanian\ncitizenship on him. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2000, and\nobtained his U.S. passport in May 2001. Shortly after he became a U.S. citizen, he\ninquired about renouncing his Jordanian citizenship, but was told\u2014incorrectly\u2014that\nthere was no procedure for renunciation.  He obtained his graduate degree in\n2\nengineering management in August 2004. He and his wife have owned their own home\nsince March 1997, and also own a rental property in the U.S. His other financial\ninterests are all in the U.S.; he has no property or financial interests in Jordan.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, three children, parents, parents-in-law, and two siblings are dual\ncitizens of the U.S. and Jordan. They all reside in the U.S. They all own homes in the\nU.S. His in-laws have lived in the U.S. since 1976. Applicant\u2019s brother runs a thrift store.\nHis sister is a housewife, married to a U.S. citizen who holds a clearance. None of his\nfamily members has any connection to the Jordanian government. Applicant\u2019s third\nsibling\u2014a sister\u2014is a resident citizen of Jordan. She is a housewife. Her husband owns\na small agricultural company. Neither has any connection to the Jordanian government.\nApplicant talks to his sister monthly.\n\n3\nUntil he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant maintained the Jordanian passport\nrequired under U.S. immigration law. That passport expired in June 2001. In 2005,\nApplicant was offered\u2014and accepted\u2014a two-year contract to work for his father\u2019s old\nbank in Jordan. His prospective supervisor recommended that he reapply for a\nJordanian passport, both to facilitate his business travel from Jordan to neighboring\ncountries and to facilitate his family\u2019s transition into Jordanian culture, including his\nchildren\u2019s admission to Jordanian schools. Aware of no reason not to, Applicant\nobtained his Jordanian passport in April 2006, and used it once to travel to Syria on\nbusiness. His wife also obtained a Jordanian passport (which also covered the three\nchildren), and they all moved to Jordan in April 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s sojourn in Jordan was short lived. His wife and children were unable\nto adjust to the culture and disliked living in Jordan. They were homesick for their family\nand friends in the U.S. Consequently, Applicant sought\u2014and received\u2014release from\nhis contractual obligation, and he and his family returned to the U.S. in November 2006.\nWhen Applicant learned of the problem with having a Jordanian passport while holding\na clearance, he surrendered his and his wife\u2019s passports to the facility security officer\n(FSO) and they were destroyed in May 2008 and January 2009, respectively (Answer,\nAttachments 2, 3).\nApplicant fully disclosed his foreign connections on his April 2007 clearance\napplication (G.E. 1) and fully discussed them during an October 2007 subject interview\n(G.E. 2). During his interview, he stated his willingness to surrender his Jordanian\npassport and renounce his Jordanian citizenship.\nAside from applying for and using a Jordanian passport, Applicant has not\nexercised his dual citizenship with Jordan since becoming a U.S. citizen. He has no\ncontacts with Jordan other than his sister.\nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses (his supervisor and two other work associates\nwho all have clearances) praise his honesty and integrity, and his handling of sensitive\ncompany information. All are aware of the foreign influence and preference issues and\nrecommend him for his clearance. \nJordan is a constitutional monarchy with a developing economy and a modern\ninfrastructure. Jordan has followed a pro-western foreign policy and has had close\nrelations with the U.S. for more than four decades. The Jordanian government respects\nhuman rights in some areas, but its overall record continues to reflect some problems.\nProblems include: torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, denial of due process,\ninfringement on citizen\u2019s privacy rights, political detainees, and restrictions on freedom\nof speech, press, assembly, association, and movement. Under Jordanian law any male\nrelative may prevent a woman or child from leaving Jordan by placing a hold on their\ntravel with the Jordanian authorities, even if they are U.S. citizens. Jordanian law\napplies to dual U.S.-Jordanian citizens. The Jordanian government publicly condemned\nterrorist acts throughout the world, practiced strict security measures, passed new anti-\nterror legislation, and disrupted several terrorist plots. Despite Jordan\u2019s aggressive\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n4\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\n4\npursuit of terrorists, the threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Al-Qaida has focused\nterrorist activities against Jordan and U.S. interests in Jordan. Terrorist organizations\nhave targeted the U.S. for intelligence through human espionage and by other means.\nInternational terrorist groups have conducted intelligence operations as effectively as\nstate intelligence services.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant obtained and used a Jordanian passport after becoming a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen.  However Applicant mitigated the Guideline C security\n4\n\ncitizenship by an American citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n5\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n6\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n7\n\u00b6 11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n8\n\u00b6 11(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n9\ninvalidated; \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n10\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7 (a).\n11\n5\nconcerns. Record evidence demonstrates that his exercise of Jordanian citizenship was\ninnocuous, sensible, and unwitting. That alone would not excuse the exercise of\nJordanian citizenship. His dual citizenship was based on his actively renewing or\naffirming his Jordanian citizenship.  All exercise of dual citizenship occurred while he\n5\nwas an adult.  Applicant's use of his Jordanian passport was not sanctioned by the\n6\nU.S.  However, Applicant has met the two most salient mitigating conditions. He has\n7\nexpressed a willingness to renounce his foreign citizenship.  He stated\u2014and acted\n8\nupon\u2014a willingness to invalidate his passport.  Applicant has resided in the U.S. over\n9\n20 years. Aside from the one business trip to Syria, all his foreign travel after becoming\na U.S. citizen has been accomplished on his U.S. passport. His interests and his roots\nare well established here. I resolve Guideline C for Applicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected\n10\ninformation requires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and\nability to target protected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to\nobtain that information, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative\nor positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or\nother foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a\nheightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.11\n\n6\nIn this case, the argument for disqualification under Guideline B is not\npersuasive. Considering first the foreign country involved, Jordan and the U.S. enjoy\nexcellent foreign relations. Jordan has been an active participant in anti-terrorism\nefforts. Indeed, its on-going human rights issues appear largely related to its anti-\nterrorism pursuits. However, Jordan is not known to target protected U.S. information,\nnor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. Further, in this\ncase it is not clear what further claim Jordan might have on Applicant. The risk that\nJordan might seek protected information from Applicant is low, if not non-existent. The\nmain risk in this case is the information gathering activities of the terrorist organizations\nthemselves. But the record evidence reflects that these organizations operate in, and\ntarget, areas frequented by westerners.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s situation in relation to the Jordanian government or\nterrorist organizations, the government produced no evidence that there was any risk,\nmuch less a heightened risk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Jordan.\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a housewife; her husband owns a small agricultural company. Their\nvisibility to either the Jordanian government or terrorist organizations seems low.\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his sister are infrequent. Neither she nor her husband are\nconnected to the Jordanian government or otherwise situated to be exploited for\ninformation gathering. There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in Jordan, or\nin Applicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that he could be impelled to\nprovide protected information to Jordan. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nA whole person analysis of the facts in this case requires no different result.\nStrictly speaking, this case involves no misconduct subject to the kind of analysis\ncontemplated by RAG \u00b6 2 (a), but revolves around Applicant\u2019s status in relation to his\nfamily members in Jordan. The salient consideration under the whole person analysis is\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. As indicated above, the\npotential for such influence in Applicant\u2019s case is low.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-b: For Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-e: For Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance granted.\n                                              \n                                             \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 3, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on November 16, 2007.  On March 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and G for Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 27, 2009.  She answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on April 14, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on May 4, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on May 29, 2009.  The Government offered\n\n2\nExhibits (GXs) 1 through 14, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified\non her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through F, without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 3, 2009.  I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until June 13, 2009, to submit additional\nmatters.  On June 11, 2009, she submitted Exhibits G through J, without objection. The\nrecord closed on June 15, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following verbiage\nto \u00b6 1.b, \u201cYou are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid taxes for tax\nyears 2006, 2007, and 2008\" (TR at page 78 lines 1~13).  There being no objection, the\nmotion to amend was granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.,\n1.c., 1.e., 1.g.~1.i. and 2.b.~2.d. of the SOR, with explanations.  She denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.f., and 2.a. of the SOR..\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant is a 48 year old Data Management Analyst (TR at page 35 line 18\nto page 36 line 6).  She has held a security clearance for \u201cabout 26 years\u201d (TR at page\n11~13).  She \u201cgot into financial difficulties four years ago,\u201d for the most part, when she\nspeculated in the real estate market, and the real estate \u201cmarket crashed\u201d (TR at page\n34 lines 13~20, and at page 38 line 23 to page 39 line 13).\n1.a.  In November of 2007, the Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7\nBankruptcy; and as a result, most of her indebtedness was discharged by way of\nbankruptcy, in March of 2008 (TR at page 36 line 24 to page 38 line 2, and GXs 6 and\n7).  However, her tax debts were not discharged; and as such, remained outstanding\n(Id).\n1.b.  The Applicant is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid\ntaxes in the following amounts: for tax year 2006, $11; for tax year 2007, $7,481; and\nfor tax year 2008, $11,723 (AppX H).  She has set up a payment plan with the IRS, by\nwhich she is making monthly payments of $140 towards these back taxes (Id).\n1.c.  It is alleged that the Applicant was indebted to a municipality for unpaid\nproperty taxes in the amount of about $6,564 (see GX 13).  The Applicant thought that\nthis debt was discharged by her bankruptcy (TR at page 50 line 13 to page 51 line 9,\n\n3\nand at page 52 lines 6~13).  In any event, the Applicant owes no property taxes to this\nmunicipality, as evidenced by a printout from this creditor (AppX I).\n1.d.  It is alleged that the Applicant was indebted to a county for unpaid\nsupplemental taxes in the amount of about $412.  In her answer and at the hearing, the\nApplicant has repeatedly denied this debt (TR at page 54 lines 21~25).  Furthermore,\nthis alleged tax debt does not appear on the Government\u2019s most recent credit report\nfrom May 2009 (GX 14).  I find that this debt is not outstanding.\n1.e.~1.i.  In the past, the Applicant\u2019s father had expressed concern about her\ngambling (TR at page 40 lines 9~21).  In part, as a result, she received counseling for\ncompulsive gambling from May through November of 2007 (TR at page 59 lines 1~14,\nand GX 5).  She also attended Gamblers Anonymous (GA) meetings from May of 2007\nto May of 2008 (TR at page 70 lines 4~19, and at page 72 line 24 to page 74 line 11).\nPrior to filing for the protection of bankruptcy in November of 2007, the Applicant\nattempted to acquire money through her gambling, in order to help with her financial\nproblems.  She would also use credit cards to obtain cash advances to fund her\ngambling.  She last gambled just \u201cthree weeks\u201d prior to her hearing (TR at page 72 line\n24 to page 74 line 11).  After her hearing, the Applicant has now expressed an intention\nto again attend GA meetings (AppX J).\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\n2.a.~2.d.  Prior to May of 2007, the Applicant was consuming alcohol to the point\nof intoxication and blackouts (GX 5).  She would consume as many as six to eight\nglasses of wine on a weekend, and suffered blackouts \u201conce or twice\u201d (TR at page 60\nline 1 to page 61 line 4).  As a result, she received counseling for alcohol abuse, from\nMay through November of 2007 (TR at page 62 line 1 to page 66 line 22, and GX 5).\nThe Applicant abstained from the use of alcohol while she attended Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) meetings, from May~July of 2007 (TR at page 62 line 1 to page 66\nline 22).  However, she started to consume alcohol again two days after she received a\n60 day chip from AA, for 60 days of sobriety (TR at page 68 line 18 to page 70 line 3).\nShe continues to consume alcohol, and last consumed the intoxicant the night prior to\nher hearing (TR at page 66 lines 5~20, and at page 72 lines 18~23, and at page 76\nlines 15~25).  After her hearing, the Applicant has now expressed an intention to again\nattend AA meetings (AppX J).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations@ may raise security concerns.  Subparagraphs 19(f) and 19(i) are\nalso applicable: \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to . . . gambling . . . ;\u201d and\n\u201ccompulsive . . . gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful attempt to stop gambling . . .\nborrowing money to fund gambling . . . .\u201d  Although the mitigating condition noted in\nSubparagraph 20(d) is applicable; i.e., \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  The Applicant has addressed\nthose tax debts not discharged by her bankruptcy.  However, the mitigating condition\nunder subparagraph 20(b) is not applicable, as \u201cthe individual [has not] acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.@  She used her credit cards to fund her gambling,\ndespite her being in financial distress.  Compulsive gambling is not a way to insure\nfinancial stability.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG Paragraph 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Under Subparagraph 21(d), a \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional . . . of alcohol abuse . . .\u201d raises that concern.  The Appellant was\ndiagnosed as suffering from alcohol abuse; yet up until the very night preceding her\nhearing, she consumed the intoxicant.  As such, I can find no countervailing mitigating\ncondition applicable here.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Subparagraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her Financial\nConsiderations and Alcohol Consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process of law; whether the Judge failed to consider all the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Finding no error, we affirm. The Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, totaling over $12,000. He stated that these debts had been \u201cdue and owing for several years.\u201d Decision at 5. While acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due at least in part to a period of unemployment, the Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to her debts. Specifically, the Judge noted that Applicant had not paid off any of them, even the smallest ones. The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns in her case. After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On March 2, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On September 29, 2009, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process of law; whether\nthe Judge failed to consider all the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm. \nThe Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, totaling over $12,000.  He\nstated that these debts had been \u201cdue and owing for several years.\u201d  Decision at 5.  While\nacknowledging that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due at least in part to a period of\nunemployment, the Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard\nto her debts.  Specifically, the Judge noted that Applicant had not paid off any of them, even the\nsmallest ones.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the trustworthiness\nconcerns in her case.\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.

(Item 4.) On March 2, 2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nthe Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility\nfor the Applicant to hold a Sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).  The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n\n2\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 16, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on May 27, 2009. The Applicant received the FORM on June\n2, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. She did not submit\nany additional information. The case was assigned to me on August 5, 2009.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to sensitive\npersonal information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 46 and single.  She is employed by a defense contractor and is\nseeking to obtain a determination of trustworthiness in connection with her employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nshe is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Applicant admitted allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.i.,\nunder this paragraph.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. She\ndenied allegations 1.d., 1.g., and 1.h.\nThe Applicant states that many of these debts became due and owing when she\nwas unemployed. The record shows that she was unemployed from October 2002 to\nMay 2003, and from October 2005 to January 2008. She has been employed by her\ncurrent employer since then. (Item 4 at question 6.)\n1.a.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted in the amount of $551 for a\njudgment entered against her in 2001 in relation to a lease. (Item 7 at 2.) This debt has\nnot been paid.\n1.b.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a loan company in the amount\nof $1,368 for a judgment entered against her in 2001. (Item 7 at 2.) This debt has not\nbeen paid.\n1.c.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a credit bureau in the amount of\n$2,254 for a judgment entered against her in 2002. (Item 7 at 2.) This debt has not been\npaid.\n\n3\n1.d.  The Applicant denies that she owes a debt to an automobile dealership in\nthe amount of $5,020. She states in her Answer at page 1, \u201cI am disputing the amount\nof the balance owed.\u201d The automobile that she purchased stopped working after six\nmonths and she had the dealer pick it up because she could not afford to fix it. \nThe most recent credit report in the record, dated October 20, 2008, shows that\nthe Applicant was $2,918 past due. (Item 6 at 2.) In a set of Interrogatories served on\nher, the Applicant admits to owing approximately $3,278 and states, \u201cNo action taken.\nFiling for bankruptcy.\u201d (Item 7 at 3.) Based on all of the available evidence, I find that\nshe does owe a debt to this creditor, and the amount is approximately $3,278. This debt\nhas not been paid.\n1.e.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $126 for a cable television bill.  (Item 7 at 4.) This debt has not been paid.\n1.f.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a second collection agency in\nthe amount of $318 for a telephone bill.  (Item 7 at 4.) This debt has not been paid.\n1.g.  The Applicant denies that she is indebted to a third collection agency in the\namount of $3,225 for an account owed to a loan company. She states in her Answer at\npage 1, \u201cThe amount I borrowed was for $700.00 from [the loan company]. I will be\ncontacting the business and negotiating a settlement on this debt within this year.\u201d The\nrecord shows that this debt has an account number ending in 50108. (Item 5 at 7.)\n1.h.  The Applicant denies that she is indebted to the third collection agency in\nthe amount of $716 for a second account owed to a loan company. She states in her\nAnswer at page 2, \u201cThis should be for only one loan, yet there is two accounts that is\nstated that I owed.\u201d The record shows that this account has an account number ending\nwith 50107. (Item 5 at 8.) As stated above, the Applicant does admit owing at least $700\nto this creditor.\nRegarding both 1.g. and 1.h., the Applicant was served with Interrogatories last\nyear. She was informed of both of these accounts at that time. In her response, dated\nSeptember 18, 2008, the Applicant stated with regards to both, \u201cNo action taken, will be\nfiling bankruptcy or disputing. (Shows 2 accts, which is wrong.)\u201d (Item 7 at 3.)\n(Emphasis in original.) There is no evidence that the Applicant disputed either account\nsince September 2008. \nThe evidence of record is sufficient to show that the Applicant does indeed owe\ntwo debts to this creditor. The Applicant has had almost a year to resolve the\ncircumstances of these two debts. She has not done so. Based on the available\nevidence, I find that she owes two accounts to this creditor, that the amounts are\ncorrect, and that she has paid neither one.\n\n4\n1.i.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a fourth collection agency in the\namount of $932. This debt has not been paid.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness determination, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive personal information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive personal information enters into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to such information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nsensitive personal information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such\ninformation.\n \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b618:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b619(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. The Applicant, by her own admission, or as found by me,\nhas over $12,000 in past due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several\nyears. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. The following conditions have\npossible applicability in this case: \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are\nof long standing. By her own admission, she has paid none of her delinquent debts, no\nmatter how small. This mitigating condition is not applicable.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  The Applicant argues that many of these debts came from financial\nhardship.  The record shows she was unemployed for a little over two years between\nOctober 2005 and January 2008. However, she has been gainfully employed since\nthen. She states several times that she will resolve these debts, but she has not taken\nany affirmative action. A statement that she intends to resolve the indebtedness in the\nfuture is not sufficient evidence that she can or will resolve the debts.  I cannot find\nunder these particular facts that the Applicant has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20(c) provides that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s credit reports\nshow that, in the main, she is making sufficient payments on her current indebtedness.\nHowever, she has done nothing to pay her past due debts. A desire to resolve her\nsubstantial past due indebtedness is not enough.  This mitigating condition is not\napplicable.\nBased on all of the available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph 1 is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a decision: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a history of not\npaying her debts.  As set forth above, I find that there have not been permanent\nbehavioral changes as required under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I find that there is the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is a\nlikelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a trustworthiness determination. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her\nfinancial difficulties.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a finding of trustworthiness.  Accordingly,\n\n7\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDecision\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a determination of\ntrustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a Sensitive Systems\nPosition (ADP-I/II/III).\nWILFORD H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On March 2, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On September 29, 2009, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process of law; whether\n\n2\nthe Judge failed to consider all the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm. \nThe Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, totaling over $12,000.  He\nstated that these debts had been \u201cdue and owing for several years.\u201d  Decision at 5.  While\nacknowledging that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due at least in part to a period of\nunemployment, the Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard\nto her debts.  Specifically, the Judge noted that Applicant had not paid off any of them, even the\nsmallest ones.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the trustworthiness\nconcerns in her case.\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of trustworthiness\nconcern are sustainable.  See  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 for the definition of \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  \nApplicant contends that some of the evidence which the Judge considered is outdated or\notherwise not relevant.  The Board construes this as contending that the Judge denied Applicant the\ndue process provided for in the Directive.  The Judge noted in his decision that Applicant did not\nprovide a response to the File of Relevant Material.  Decision at 2.  Her appeal brief does not specify\nwhich pieces of evidence she believes to have been erroneously included in the record.  Applicant\nhas failed to demonstrate that she was denied due process.   \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).  Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is not sufficient to rebut this presumption.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant is a 42-year-old computer program analyst working for a defense contractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Vietnam by Vietnamese parents (Tr. 129). After high school, he was trained as an elementary school teacher by the Vietnamese government (Tr. 98, 129). He was exempted from his Vietnamese military service obligation because of his teaching duties. He worked as a school teacher until 1983, when he emigrated at age 23 to France with his father. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, his father was imprisoned for three to five years (Applicant was unsure about the period) because he worked for the Republic of Vietnam\u2019s government. After his imprisonment, his father had difficulty finding good employment and was forced to work odd jobs. He divorced Applicant\u2019s mother, and emigrated to France, because his mother was already living in France with one of her brothers (Tr. 130). Upon his arrival in France, Applicant and his father were considered \u201cboat refugees\u201d (Tr. 131). His father attended college in France and became a pharmacist. After becoming a French citizen, Applicant\u2019s father emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. citizen in 2002 (Tr. 100). He is currently living in the United States with his new wife.

Voelker, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns arising from his \nrelationship and contact with his Vietnamese mother. He also mitigated the foreign \npreference security concerns arising from his French citizenship and possession of a \nvalid French passport. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 12, 2007 \n(Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)) (GE 1). On October 7, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to him a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR).1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign \n \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended, \nmodified, and revised (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nMarch 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be denied or revoked. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on October 20, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 26, \n2008. DOHA issued the first notice of hearing on December 3, 2008, scheduling a \nhearing on December 23, 2008. On December 10, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered \nher appearance and requested a postponement, which I granted. The second notice of \nhearing was issued on December 12, 2008, and scheduling a hearing on January 22, \n2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The government offered exhibits (GE) \n1 through 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 14, 16).2 Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, and presented three witnesses and 17 exhibits, marked (AE) 1 through \n17, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 27). DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on January 28, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough review of all evidence \nof record, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old computer program analyst working for a defense \ncontractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Vietnam by Vietnamese parents (Tr. \n129). After high school, he was trained as an elementary school teacher by the \nVietnamese government (Tr. 98, 129). He was exempted from his Vietnamese military \nservice obligation because of his teaching duties. He worked as a school teacher until \n1983, when he emigrated at age 23 to France with his father.  \n \nAfter the fall of Saigon in 1975, his father was imprisoned for three to five years \n(Applicant was unsure about the period) because he worked for the Republic of \nVietnam\u2019s government. After his imprisonment, his father had difficulty finding good \nemployment and was forced to work odd jobs. He divorced Applicant\u2019s mother, and \nemigrated to France, because his mother was already living in France with one of her \nbrothers (Tr. 130).  \n \nUpon his arrival in France, Applicant and his father were considered \u201cboat \nrefugees\u201d (Tr. 131). His father attended college in France and became a pharmacist. \nAfter becoming a French citizen, Applicant\u2019s father emigrated to the United States and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2002 (Tr. 100). He is currently living in the United States with \nhis new wife. \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \n2  GE 4 was considered for administrative notice purposes. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 64-year-old mother worked as an administrative secretary for the \nRepublic of Vietnam before the fall of Saigon, and later for the Vietnamese government \nwhen the communists took power (Tr. 179). She is still a resident and citizen of Vietnam \nand apparently receives a retirement pension from the Vietnamese government (Tr. \n177-179). According to Applicant, his mother owns no property in Vietnam and lives in a \nhouse owned by his uncle (Tr. 99). He has telephonic contact with his mother \napproximately twice a month (Tr. 93). \n \nWhile in France, Applicant attended college and worked odd jobs in fast food \nrestaurants (Tr. 100). In 1999, he received his French citizenship and a French passport \n(Tr. 101). That same year, Applicant travelled to the United States to attend a friend\u2019s \nwedding. He met his future wife while in the United States, and in July 2000, he \nimmigrated to the United States (Tr. 106). He received his green card in December \n2001 (Tr. 106). Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2006, and \nreceived his U.S. passport in May 2006 (Tr. 107). \n \nApplicant renewed his French passport in 2005. It will expire in 2015. He became \naware of the security concerns raised by his possession of a valid French passport \nwhen he received the SOR. He surrendered it to his Facility Security Officer (FSO) with \nthe understanding that the FSO will notify appropriate DOD personnel if Applicant ever \nrequests his French passport (Tr. 108, 116, AE 1). At his hearing, Applicant credibly \nexpressed his willingness to surrender his French citizenship (Tr. 128). He has not \ncompleted the process because he does not want to inform the French embassy he is \nsurrendering his citizenship as a result of security concerns due to his employment (Tr. \n109). He promised to report to his FSO any possible foreign travel (Tr. 126). Applicant \ncredibly testified he considers the United States his home, and that his loyalty is only to \nthe United States. His wife, child, and all his financial and proprietary interests are in the \nUnited States. \n \nFrom 2004 to 2007, Applicant attended college in the United States. He received \na bachelor\u2019s degree in network administration and security in 2007. He also completed \na master\u2019s degree in telecommunications in 2008 (Tr. 114). While attending college, he \nworked part-time for the university he attended (Tr. 128-130). His then supervisor \ntestified at Applicant\u2019s hearing. His supervisor is a retired Army lieutenant colonel who \nhas held access to classified information for many years. He had close daily contact \nwith Applicant for over four years. He considers Applicant extremely honest, trustworthy, \nand reliable. Applicant\u2019s job performance was outstanding and he was regarded as an \nasset to the organization (Tr. 28-32).  \n \nApplicant voted in U.S. elections in 2006 and in 2007. One month after voting in \nthe 2006 U.S. elections, he registered to vote in French elections (Tr. 149-150). He \nvoted in French elections twice in 2007 because of his curiosity with the electoral \nprocess and because the French presidential candidate was pro-U.S. government (Tr. \n117). He has no financial or property interests in France or Vietnam (Tr. 120). His only \nrelative living in France is his 72-year-old uncle who is a retired physician with no \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                     \ncontact with the French government (Tr. 121). Since immigrating to the United States, \nApplicant travelled to France twice. In 2002, he took his wife to France to introduce her \nto his uncle; and in 2006, he travelled to France to help his uncle move (Tr. 121). He \nhas telephonic contact with his uncle approximately once a month (Tr. 93). \n \nApplicant has been back to Vietnam only once since immigrating to France in \n1983. In 2001, he took his wife to Vietnam to introduce her to his mother and extended \nfamily members living there (Tr. 122, 134). Applicant testified he is not interested in \ntravelling to Vietnam, but would travel there if his mother is sick. He would also provide \nfinancial support to his mother if needed. He expressed no interest in going back to live \nin Vietnam or retiring there (Tr. 123-125). \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a government contractor, since \n2007. His job encompasses sensitive functions in the administration of databases for \ngovernment agencies (Tr. 49). His immediate supervisor is a retired Navy warrant \nofficer. He has had direct supervision and close contact with Applicant over the last two \nyears. He considers Applicant trustworthy and an excellent worker. Applicant is diligent, \nconscientious and reliable. Applicant complies with all rules and regulations and has not \nhad any problems at work. Because of his work performance, Applicant has received \ntop evaluations and numerous awards. His supervisor recommended Applicant receive \na security clearance (Tr. 45-63). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is 38 years old. She was born and lived in Vietnam until age 11 \n(1981) when she and her Vietnamese parents immigrated to the United States via \nThailand and the Philippines. They arrive in the United States in 1984 (Tr. 89). She and \nher parents became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1990 (Tr. 70). She attended college in \nthe United States and received her bachelor\u2019s degree in finance in 1992. She has been \nworking as a financial analyst for a state government during the last 13 years (Tr. 72).  \n \nApplicant and his wife met in 1999 through her brother-in-law. They were married \nin July 2000 and decided to make their lives in the United States. They have a four-\nyear-old daughter and another child is on the way (Tr. 74). Applicant and his wife have \nfiled U.S. income tax returns since they were married. They have joint U.S. bank \naccounts, and bought a home in 2002, that has an assessed value of approximately \n$400,000 (Tr. 79).  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. France is one of the United \nStates\u2019 oldest allies and is one of the world\u2019s premier democracies. France and the \nUnited States share common values and have parallel policies on most political, \neconomic, and security issues.3 Relations between the United States and France are \nactive and friendly. Differences are discussed frankly and have not generally been \n \n \n3  Adjudication of security concerns under Guideline B requires the consideration of the foreign \ncountry involved and its relationship with the United States (AG \u00b6 6). The source of the facts in this \nparagraph is the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs August 2008, \n\u201cBackground Note: France,\u201d available at http://www.state.gov.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nallowed to impair the pattern of close cooperation that characterizes relations between \nthe two countries. France has significantly increased participation in NATO\u2019s military \nwing in recent years. Although France opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq, France has \n2,200 soldiers serving in Afghanistan, and assisted in assembling $21 billion in pledges \nfor economic assistance to Afghanistan. France is a close ally of the United States in \nthe war on terrorism.  \n \nI also take administrative notice of the following facts. Vietnam is an authoritarian \nstate ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. It often works with China, its largest \ntrading partner. U.S.-Vietnam relations have gradually been normalizing since the \n1990s, although tensions remain regarding human rights issues. Police sometimes \nmistreat those under arrest or in custody. Arbitrary detentions, particularly with regard to \npolitical activities, remain a problem. Three American citizens were arrested in Vietnam \nin 2005 while visiting relatives and charged with plotting violence against the \nVietnamese government.  \n \nFreedom of speech and of the press is restricted, particularly with regard to \nInternet access and cyber-dissidents. It is not unusual for Vietnamese citizens to be \nmonitored, and visitors may be put under surveillance. Timely notice to the U.S. of the \ndetention of a U.S. citizen in Vietnam is rare and access to such detainees can be \ndifficult, particularly if they are former citizens of Vietnam. There has been progress with \nVietnam on regional security issues, and the Vietnamese government has been helpful \nin the antiterrorism arena. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C, the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized French citizen in 1999 and was issued a French \npassport. He registered to vote and voted in French elections twice after becoming a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. He has a valid French passport that will not expire until \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n2015. Applicant has enjoyed all the privileges and rights of French citizens. Applicant\u2019s \npossession of a valid French passport, as well as his voting in French elections, \nconstitutes an exercise of his French citizenship and preference for France.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises security concerns under foreign preference \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10(a): \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of \nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member. This includes . . . (1): possession of a current foreign passport, and (7) \nvoting in a foreign election.\u201d \n \n \nIn 1999, months after becoming a naturalized French citizen, Applicant travelled \nto the United States, met his future wife, and became engaged. Applicant immigrated to \nthe United States in 2000, and married his wife. They decided to make their home in the \nUnited States. He and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. Since 2000, he has \nbeen back to France twice: the first time to introduce his wife to his uncle, and the \nsecond time to help his uncle move residences. He received his bachelor\u2019s and \nmaster\u2019s degrees in the United States, and has worked for U.S. government \ncontractors. All of Applicant\u2019s financial and economic ties are in the United States. He \nhas no other financial, economic, or proprietary interests in any foreign country. \nApplicant\u2019s questionable actions (voting in French elections and possessing a valid \nFrench passport), were in part, motivated by his curiosity of the electoral process and \nwithout knowledge that such actions would raise security concerns.  \n \n \nThese facts warrant the application of foreign preference mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b): \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d \nand 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions and past behavior do not show a preference for France over \nthe United States. Applicant and his father emigrated to France under duress seeking a \nbetter life and better living conditions. He became a French citizen in 1999, and shortly \nthereafter moved to the United States and started the process to become a U.S. citizen. \nHe surrendered his French passport to his FSO and that mitigated the passport specific \nissues. He also agreed to notify U.S. authorities of any possible foreign travel. Applicant \ncredibly expressed his willingness to renounce his French citizenship and there is not \nevidence to show he continues to exercise his French citizenship. Applicant and his wife \nhave made the United States their home. Their daughter is an American citizen. All their \nfinancial and proprietary interests are in the United States. Considering the record as a \nwhole, Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference security concerns. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                     \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.6 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his mother, who is a citizen and resident \nof Vietnam. The closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s feelings of \naffection and obligation, his frequent telephone contacts, and his trip to Vietnam to \nintroduce his wife to his mother. This contact creates a risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation, because there is always the possibility that Vietnam\u2019s \ngovernment may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the United States.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nOne Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition under AG \u00b6 8 is applicable to these \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. \n \nI do not believe Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his mother creates a \nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because the nature of the \nimproving relations between the United States and Vietnam. Although the Vietnamese \ngovernment does have a questionable history with respect to human rights, there is no \nevidence it does so with the purpose of obtaining classified or sensitive information \nabout the United States.  \n \nSince 1983, when he emigrated from Vietnam, Applicant has travelled back to \nVietnam once to visit his mother and other extended family members there. His mother \nis 64 years old and retired from her administrative secretary position. She lives in a \nhome owned by Applicant\u2019s uncle in France, and appears to be financially independent. \nAlthough Applicant has feelings of affection and obligation for his mother, I do not \nbelieve those feelings would overcome Applicant\u2019s feelings and obligations for his wife, \nchild, and all of his financial and economic interests in the United States. Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and has lived in the United States approximately nine \nyears. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for three years. He credibly asserted his \nwillingness to surrender his French citizenship and his desire to be only a U.S. citizen. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nIn a short period, he and his wife have established themselves in the United States. He \nhas worked hard for government contractors earning their trust. There is no evidence he \nhas ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States, or that \nhe lacks honesty and integrity. His mother in Vietnam and his uncle in France are not \nlikely to be vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power or terrorist \norganizations.  \n \nOn balance, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the \nfacts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.
