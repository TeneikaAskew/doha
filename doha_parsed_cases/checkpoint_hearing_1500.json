Gregorian, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/18/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 24, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On August 14, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn October 11, 2019, and again on December 2, 2019, Applicant responded to \nthe SOR, and he elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. (Item 1)  A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on \nJanuary 16, 2020, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on January 22, 2020. His \nresponse was due on February 21, 2020. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, \nfor as of March 18, 2020, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me \non March 18, 2020. The record closed on March 18, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nSOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying \ncomments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an operations supervisor with his current employer since February 2014. He had \nprevious experience with other employers as a full-time data entry (August 2012 until \nFebruary 2014), and as a part-time server (May 2009 until March 2013). He is a 2009 \nhigh school graduate, with a semester of college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army Active Reserve in December 2011, and served until he was honorably \ndischarged in December 2017. He transitioned into the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), \nand remained in that status until he was released in December 2019. He has never been \ngranted a security clearance. He has never been married, but he has a child, born in \n2013.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated November 1, 2017); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nJune 12, 2019); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 15, 2020); Item 2 (SF 86, \ndated October 24, 2017); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 13, 2018); \nItem 6 (Subject Contact, dated February 21, 2018); and Item 1 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to \nSOR, dated October 11, 2019, and December 2, 2019).  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nApplicant reported that he was unemployed from March 2013 until October 2013. \n(Item 6, at 5) He identified several factors that led to his financial difficulties. He claimed \nhis difficulties began when he was 21 years old and continued until he was 27 years old, \nand he indicated that immaturity and youth were his basic causes. His problems were \nexacerbated when his overtime hours were reduced, leaving him insufficient funds to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status. (Item 6, at 7, 10) As a result, he got behind on \nhis bills.  \nIn his 2017 SF 86, Applicant listed having only one delinquent account \u2013 a vehicle \nrepossession \u2013 caused by unspecified \u201cfinancial trouble.\u201d (Item 2, at 32-33) On February \n13, 2018, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant did not identify or discuss any other delinquent accounts \nuntil he was confronted by the investigator with information associated with additional \ndelinquent accounts. He indicated that he did not list them in his SF 86 because he was \nconfused by the term \u201ccharge off.\u201d During a subsequent interview on February 21, 2018, \nhe was able to discuss more specifics regarding his delinquent accounts. He \nacknowledged that he had not made any payments on the accounts, but indicated that \nhe would contact several of his creditors or collection agents in an effort to start resolving \nthem. He added a confusing comment regarding several of the ignored accounts by \nnoting that they were charged off, and thus they were \u201cresolved.\u201d (Item 6, at 9-10) \nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $27,800, as \nset forth as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is motor vehicle lease for $24,000 on a vehicle that Applicant leased \nfor the mother of his child, but when his overtime hours were reduced and he and the \nwoman split up, he was unable to continue making the $288 monthly payments and the \nvehicle was involuntarily repossessed in 2016, and $10,365 was charged off. The \nremaining unpaid balance is now $10,979. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 1; Item 5, at 2-3; Item \n6, at 6, 8) The account remains delinquent. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $9,932 that was \ncharged off in 2016. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 3-4; Item 6, at 10) The account \nremains delinquent. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,552 that was \ncharged off in 2015. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 4; Item 6, at 9) The account \nremains delinquent. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,818 that was \ncharged off in 2017. (Item 3, at 5; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 9) The account \nremains delinquent. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $655 that was charged \noff on an unreported date. (Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 2) However, Applicant contends that \nthe account is still active and that he has been making payments on it since October \n2016. Although he failed to submit any documents to support his claims that he has been \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nmaking those payments, his January 15, 2020 credit report confirms that the account has \nbeen current since December 2017, and that the most recent $55 payment was made in \nDecember 2019, leaving a balance of $747. (Item 5, at 3) Applicant claims that the \nremaining balance as of December 2019 is $842. (Item 1) The account has been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. is an Internet or cable-television account with an unpaid balance of \n$1,341 that was placed for collection in 2017. (Item 3, at 8; Item 6, at 7, 9) During his \nFebruary 21, 2018 OPM interview, Applicant indicated he would contact the creditor or \ncollection agent to resolve the debt, but as of his October 2019 Answer to the SOR, he \nclaimed to be working on it to be settled within six months. (Item 6, at 9; Item 1) The \naccount remains delinquent. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of $523 that \nwas placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3, at 8; Item 6, at 6-9) During his February 21, \n2018 OPM interview, Applicant indicated he would contact the creditor or collection agent \nwithin the following month to resolve the debt, but as of his October 2019 Answer to the \nSOR, he claimed to be working on it to be settled within three months. (Item 6, at 8-9; \nItem 1) The account remains delinquent. (Item 1) \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. Although he had previously indicated that he planned to seek credit counseling, \nthere is no documentary evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional \nfinancial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts, including one vehicle repossession \nand four charged-off accounts, totaling approximately $27,800. One of those debts \nbecame delinquent as early as 2015, and by the time the record closed in March 2020, \nonly one of them had been verifiably addressed by Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have \nbeen established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. As noted \nabove, Applicant attributed his financial problems to his immaturity and youth, and felt \nthat his problems were exacerbated when his overtime hours were reduced. While the \nreduction of overtime hours was largely beyond his control, overtime is not a guaranteed \nemployment benefit, it is a speculative or potential one. A review of his credit reports \nreveals that Applicant simply stopped making payments over time, with the initial \nnonpayment starting in 2015, and others following each year thereafter, resulting in four \naccounts being charged off, one vehicle being involuntarily repossessed, and two other \naccounts merely being placed for collection. As of the date the record closed in March \n2020, he had verifiably addressed only one such account with minimum monthly \npayments of $55, leaving the remaining debts unaddressed by him. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)).  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for several years, \nmake it rather easy to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent and they \nare likely to remain unchanged. Applicant completed his SF 86 in October 2017; \nunderwent his OPM interviews in February 2018; and the SOR was issued in August \n2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. In February 2018, he promised to start \nsatisfying his debts in the near future. In his Answers to the SOR, he was still promising \nto settle two of the debts within three to six months, but with the exception of one debt, \nhe still had taken no positive actions to address the remaining debts. Although he could \nhave indicated some positive action in response to the FORM, he failed to do so. It should \nbe noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in \nthe future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and \notherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore most \nof his delinquent accounts even after he was interviewed by OPM. With that one \nexception, he failed to resolve any of his delinquent accounts or submit recommended \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \ndocumentation in over one year since his OPM interviews. An applicant who begins to \nresolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security \nclearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. \n(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-\n00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)). In this instance, there has been promises, but \nvery little action following those promises. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n \nIn the absence of any significant positive activity by Applicant, of financial \ncounseling, and a budget, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a \nbetter position financially than he had been. His actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. He is \na 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he has been serving as an \noperations supervisor since February 2014. He had previous experience with other \nemployers as a full-time data entry (August 2012 until February 2014), and as a part-time \nserver (May 2009 until March 2013). He is a 2009 high school graduate, with a semester \nof college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Active Reserve in \nDecember 2011, and served until he was honorably discharged in December 2017. He \ntransitioned into the IRR, and remained in that status until he was released in December \n2019.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant was immature and failed to exercise sufficient \ncontrol over his various accounts to assure that they were maintained in a current status.  \nAs a result, seven accounts totaling approximately $27,800 became delinquent, including \none vehicle repossession and four charged-off accounts. One of those debts became \ndelinquent as early as 2015, and by the time the record closed in March 2020, only one \nof them had been verifiably addressed by Applicant. He routinely made unfulfilled \npromises to address his debts, but he failed to do so, even with one having a relatively \nmodest balance of $523. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is poor, at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The original SOR alleges that \nApplicant has 24 delinquent debts totaling over $1,000,000. Department Counsel \namended the SOR by adding two additional debts totaling about $50,000. The SOR also \nalleges Applicant was twice arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol within a \nnine-month period in 2014 and 2015. Applicant provided substantial evidence to mitigate \nthe Guideline G security concerns alleged in the SOR, but he provided insufficient \nmitigation evidence regarding the Guideline F allegations. Accordingly, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 20, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking to renew a previously granted clearance. On December 13, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and G. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, \n\n2 \n \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative decisions \non or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 15, 2020, (SOR Answer). He elected \nto have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. He admitted the 24 \nSOR allegations under Guideline F and the five allegations under Guideline G. He also \nprovided explanations, details, and other comments on each allegation. In addition, he \nattached nine documents to his SOR Answer, which I have marked as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through I. \n \nOn February 20, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included 11 attached documents \nidentified as Items 1-11. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections, submit a written response, and documents \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by the SOR allegations. He \nwas advised in the FORM that he had 30 days from his receipt of the FORM to submit his \nresponse.  \n \nApplicant received the FORM on March 5, 2020. His response was due on April 4, \n2020, but he did not submit a rebuttal or any additional documents. A forwarding \nmemorandum, dated June 12, 2020, contained an ambiguity as to whether Applicant \nsubmitted a response to the FORM. I sought clarification of the ambiguity from \nDepartment Counsel. He advised in an email that he reviewed the file, and he confirmed \nthat the file does not include a response from Applicant to the FORM. I have included a \ncopy of that correspondence in the file as Administrative Exhibit I.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on January 15, 2020. In the absence of any \nobjections, I have admitted into the record all of the evidentiary submissions of both \nparties. \n \nAmendment to the SOR \n \n \nIn his FORM, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding the following two \nadditional allegations under Guideline F:  \n \n\u00b6 1.y. You are indebted to BizFi funding (sic) in the approximate amount of \n$32,971. As of the date of the statement of reasons (sic), this debt remains \nunpaid \n \n\u00b6 1.z. You are indebted to Fox funding (sic) in the approximate amount of \n$17,209. As of the date of the statement of reasons (sic), this debt remains \nunpaid. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant disclosed both debts on his SCA, although neither debt is listed on the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports in evidence. The basis for the Government\u2019s amendment is \nthe fact that Applicant noted both debts in his SOR Answer. He also attached letters from \nthe creditors regarding proposed settlements, though he did not provide documentary \nproof that he had made any payments towards the debts. The factual circumstances are \naddressed further in the Findings of Facts section, below.  \n \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so he therefore did not either \u201cadmit\u201d or \n\u201cdeny\u201d either SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y or 1.z. As Department Counsel requests in his FORM, I will \nconsider the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z to be denied, and hold the Government to \nits burden of proof as to those new allegations. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his response to the allegations set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.x in my findings of fact, and I have noted his comments on each \nallegation. For the reason stated above, I consider SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z to be denied. \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from FORM Item 4, his SCA; Item 5, the \nsummary of Applicant\u2019s security clearance subject interview, which he verified as \naccurate (Verified Subject Interview); and Item 3, his January 2020 SOR Answer. \nAdditional findings are based upon other evidence in the record. I have noted such \nfindings with a parenthetical citation to the record.  \n \n \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM and \nthe documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 41, has worked as an information technology engineer for a number of \ncompanies since at least 2008. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology \nin December 2016. He has held a top secret clearance since December 2013, though in \n2017 he was advised by a DOD agency that he was not eligible for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information. (Item 4 at 52.) \n \n \nApplicant has been married and divorced twice. Both marriages lasted about two \nyears (2001-2003 and 2014-2016). He has three children, who were born in 1999, 2010, \nand 2017. He pays monthly child support of $2,500 for his two youngest children. In his \nSOR Answer, he asserts that this child support obligation limits his financial ability to \naddress his other debts. (Item 3 at 1.) \n \n \nApplicant provided two different versions of his employment history during the two \ntime periods relevant to the Guideline F allegations in the SOR. One period is the later \npart of 2015 (Period 1), which preceded Applicant\u2019s commencement of a business in \nJanuary 2016. The business was related to Applicant\u2019s hobby and had no relationship to \nhis information technology engineering work. The second period is 2016 through part of \n2017 (Period 2), when Applicant incurred significant credit-card debts and loans to fund \nhis business. During Period 2, he defaulted on these debts when his business \u201cstalled\u201d \n\n4 \n \neight months after it commenced operations and ultimately failed in 2017. (SOR Answer \nat 2; Item 4 at 55-57; Item 5 at 12.) \n \n \nIn the employment section of his July 2018 SCA (Section 13A), Applicant \nrepresented that he has been continuously employed since at least 2008. He failed to \nmention that he started and operated a business in 2016 and 2017. During Period 1, he \nlisted working for Company A (November 2014 through at least the date of the SCA, July \n2018) and simultaneously working for Company B (October 2014 through February \n2017), and Company C (September 2010 through May 2016). He wrote that he worked \nfor a fourth employer, Company D, from June 2014 to June 2015. His employment history \nin the SCA does not reflect any loss of employment or income in the second half of 2015, \nexcept for his work for Company D. (Item 4 at 13-14, 18-23; Item 5 at 4.) \n \n \nIn Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s SCA regarding his Financial Record, he disclosed that \nin Period 1, preceding the commencement of his business, he lost an \u201cIT Contract paying \nhim $150,000 per year and then lost a \u201csecond job\u201d paying him $127,000 per year. He \nwrote that after the loss of these two jobs, he started his business to \u201cgenerate additional \nincome.\u201d He noted further that \u201cthe business took a turn and downward spiral (sic) \nextremely fast and I was unable to . . . maintain the payments\u201d on his business debts. He \nalso noted that his third child was born (January 2017), which \u201cfurther complicat[ed] \nthings\u201d and that he \u201cwas also dealing with the financial fallout from [his] divorce the \nprevious year.\u201d He finalized his divorce in March 2016. (Item 4 at 33, 37, 55-57; Item 5 at \n12.) \n \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant moved out of his marital home and rented the \nresidence to a friend. He purchased a new home in the same month with a mortgage in \nthe amount of $440,000. In his Verified Subject Interview, Applicant reported that his \n\u201cfinancial problems began\u201d when he lost his job with Company B in February 2017. He \nnoted that this employment was his full-time employment. He also explained in his \nVerified Subject Interview that he and his business suffered a financial loss as a result of \nactions of a now-former friend. (Item 4 at 33, 37, 55-57; Item 5 at 12; Item 8 at 1.) \n \n \nFrom this record evidence, it is unclear what employment losses Applicant suffered \nprior to starting his business in January 2016. His work for Company D ceased in June \n2015. As of January 2016, he was working simultaneously at Company A, Company B, \nand Company C. Applicant\u2019s employment at multiple companies at the same time during \nPeriods 1 and 2 creates some confusion in the record, which he tried to clarify in his \nVerified Subject Interview. Applicant\u2019s failure to list his self-employment in Section 13A of \nhis SCA creates additional confusion. He explained in his interview that he omitted his \nself-employment with his business \u201cdue to oversight.\u201d (Item 4 at 13-14, 18-20; Item 5 at \n4, 12.) \n \n \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant asserts that many of his debts arise from his \nbusiness, which ultimately failed in September 2017. He used multiple credit cards and \nloans to fund his startup and operating expenses for his business. He also claims that he \nprovided some capital from his savings. He was unable to pay his business debts due to \n\n5 \n \nthe loss of his job with Company B in February 2017 and the failure of the business. As \nnoted, however, he worked for Company A throughout 2017 and for other companies \nbeginning in May 2017 to the present. He also suffered income loss from his rental \nproperty when a tenant, who was a friend, failed to pay the rent. (Item 3 at 2, 3; Item 4 at \n55, 63; Item 5 at 4, 9, 12, 13.) \n \nGuideline F: \n \n \nMortgage Debts \u2013 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege delinquencies on two mortgage \ndebts: the mortgage on Applicant\u2019s residence and a mortgage on his rental property.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a In his January 2020 SOR Answer, Applicant admitted that he was \ndelinquent on his residential mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a, a debt of $432,371). He wrote that he \nfell behind in his mortgage payments due to the failure of his business. He claimed further \nthat he had entered into a repayment plan with the lender and will have be current on his \nmortgage payments and past-due amounts with payments made up to and including \nAugust 2020. He provided with his Answer a letter from the lender, dated August 9, 2019, \nsetting forth the terms of the payment plan. The plan calls for Applicant to pay his regular \nmortgage payment of $2,767, plus an additional amount of $1,820 to repay his \ndelinquencies, starting September 1, 2019 and ending on August 1, 2020. Aside from his \nassertion in his Answer that he will satisfy his past-due balance on August 1, 2020, he \nprovided no evidence showing that he made any of the required 12 monthly payments. \nThe most recent credit report in the record, dated June 6, 2019, does not provide any \nuseful information about the current status of this debt because it predates the payment \nplan. The Government provided no evidence to raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat he was repaying the past due amounts. The debt is, therefore, resolved. (Item 8 at \n1; AE A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b Applicant admitted that he was delinquent paying a mortgage on his \nrental property in the amount of $375,172. In his SCA, Applicant wrote that his tenant \nfailed to pay the rent. Applicant\u2019s attempts to save the property from foreclosure were \nunsuccessful. The property was sold at auction in September 2017. He asserted that \n\u201ceverything was ratified and closed in March 2018.\u201d In support of his assertion that he \nowes nothing further on this debt, he provided with his Answer a copy of the court\u2019s online \ncase information summary of the foreclosure proceeding. It reflects that on March 7, 2018, \nthe \u201cFinal Order Ratifying the Auditor\u2019s Report\u201d was entered. No deficiency balance is \nindicated. The Government\u2019s 2019 credit report (Item 8) reflects the foreclosure, but it \ndoes not indicate that Applicant has any further obligations to the lender. The evidence \nestablishes that Applicant lost this property due to his default on the mortgage loan and \nthe lender\u2019s foreclosure of the property. The Government\u2019s evidence does not establish \nthat the auction of the property resulted in a deficiency or to otherwise contradict \nApplicant\u2019s assertions. The debt is, therefore, resolved. (Item 4 at 56-57; Item 5 at 9; AE \nB.) \n \n \nCredit-Card Debts - The SOR sets forth 11 allegations involving delinquent credit-\ncard debts that were used to fund Applicant\u2019s business. The total amount of these debts \n\n6 \n \nis over $140,000. In his SOR Answer, he provided evidence that one of these debts had \nbeen resolved (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant made no claim and presented no evidence that any \nof the remaining debts have been addressed, let alone paid. He wrote that he was paying \n$1,125 per month on two business debts and that he was \u201cnearing the end of repayment \nand will free up monies to go towards other debts.\u201d He also wrote that his monthly child-\nsupport payments for two of his children was about $2,500 and that these payments \nconstrained his ability to repay more of his debts at that time. He asserted that he is \ncommitted to repaying all of his debts. (SOR Answer at 2-7.) In his SOR Answer, Applicant \nadmitted each of these debts, except for one that he paid, which is:  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e (collection account in the amount of $17,557) \u2013 Applicant opened this \ncredit-card account in March 2016 and defaulted in about August 2016. The creditor \nobtained a judgment on this debt in August 2017. Applicant submitted evidence that the \njudgment was satisfied in August 2019. This debt has been resolved. (Item 8 at 2; AE G \nat 3.) \n \n \nThe admitted, unpaid credit-card debts alleged in the SOR are the following: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (past due on a debt of $48,958) \u2013 (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 8.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g (charged-off account in the amount of $13,673) \u2013 (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 \nat 3; Item 5 at 10.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h (charged-off account in the amount of $13,529) \u2013 (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 \nat 3; Item 5 at 10.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i (charged-off account in the amount of $13,022) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at \n4; Item 5 at 10.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j (collection account in the amount of $11,298) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at \n6.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l (charged-off account in the amount of $10,637) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at \n5.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m (charged-off account in the amount of $7,778) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at \n5.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n (collection account in the amount of $3,173) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at \n29.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o (charged-off account in the amount of $2,425) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at \n5.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q (collection account in the amount of $1,268) \u2013 (Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 6.) \n \n\n7 \n \nMiscellaneous SOR Delinquent Debts \n \n \nApplicant admitted in his SOR Answer each of the 11 miscellaneous debts. These \ndebts total about $66,000. Applicant made no claim and presented no evidence that any \nof these debts have been addressed, let alone paid, with the exception of two debts \ndiscussed below, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z.  \n \n \nThe debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.k, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.w remain outstanding. \nApplicant explained in his SOR Answer that he is paying $2,500 in monthly child support \nfor two of his children, as well as $1,125 per month on two business debts (Amended \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z, discussed below). These payments, he said, have constrained his \nability to pay these miscellaneous SOR debts. He asserted, however that he is committed \nto repaying all of his debts. (Item 3 at 2-7) These six debts as well as five other outstanding \ndebts are addressed individually below.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (bank loan in collection in the amount of $20,786) \u2013 In his SOR Answer, \nApplicant admitted that he owed this debt and commented that it was related to his \nbusiness. (Item 3 at 2; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 28.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f (unsecured home improvement loan in the amount of $14,174 on the \nforeclosed rental property) \u2013 In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted this debt. He wrote \nthat the lender has been acquired by one company and then by a second company. He \ncommented, without providing corroborating documentation, that he is seeking to \ndetermine which company owns the debt and \u201conce that is settled a way forward can be \nestablished.\u201d The loan has been in default since about February 2017. (Item 3 at 3; Item \n8 at 2; Item 9 at 8.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k (charged-off line of credit in the amount of $10,895) \u2013 In his SOR \nAnswer, Appellant admitted this debt was outstanding and describes this debt as a \n\u201cChecking Line of Credit used to help fund and sustain my former business until its failure \nin 2017.\u201d (Item 3 at 4; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p (bank loan in collection in the amount of $1,538) \u2013 Applicant admitted \nin his SOR Answer that he owed this collection account. He claimed that he was in the \nprocess of making \u201carrangements . . . with [the collection agency] to satisfy this debt within \nthe next 30 days. Documentation can be provided upon collection.\u201d His assertion was not \nsubsequently corroborated with any documents. (Item 3 at 5; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 29.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r (collection account in the amount of $907 for a delinquent insurance \ndebt) \u2013 Applicant admitted this debt in his SOR Answer. He wrote that he is \u201cmaking \narrangements to satisfy this account within the next 30 days\u201d and that \u201c[d]ocumentation \ncan be provided upon completion.\u201d Applicant submitted no documentation evidencing \npayment. (Item 3 at 6; Item 8 at 3.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.s (collection account in the amount of $379 for a delinquent utility bill) \u2013 \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted that there is a balance due on this account, which \n\n8 \n \nis associated with his foreclosed rental property. He asserted that there is a dispute about \nwho is responsible for this debt. He also wrote, however, that the balance will be paid, \n\u201cwithin the next 30 days\u201d and that \u201cdocumentation can be provided upon completion.\u201d He \nprovided no additional documentation evidencing the payment of this debt. (Item 3 at 6; \nItem 8 at 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.t (charged-off debt in the amount of $13,103 for a delinquent account with \nan equipment supplier) \u2013 In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted this debt, which was \nrelated to his business. In his Verified Subject interview, he reported that he was working \nwith the creditor to resolve the debt. He provided no documentation at that time or \nsubsequently to support his claim or to evidence that he had resolved the debt. (Item 3 at \n6; Item 5 at 10; Item 9 at 4.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1u, 1.v, and 1.w (charged-off debts in the amounts of $2,139; $1,981; \nand $307, respectively, for delinquent accounts with an equipment supplier) \u2013 Applicant \nadmitted in his SOR Answer that these business debts remained unpaid. (Item 3 at 6-7; \nItem 9 at 6-7.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.x (collection account in the amount of $1,013 for a delinquent account) \u2013 \nApplicant admitted in his SOR Answer that this debt was \u201cvalid.\u201d He commented that \n\u201cthere was concerns over who owed the balance as this account is related to [the \nforeclosed rental property.]\u201d He noted further that \u201carrangement are being made to satisfy \nthis debt within the next 60 days\u201d and that [d]ocumentation can be provided upon \ncompletion.\u201d He provided no further documentary evidence to show that this debt had, in \nfact, been paid. (Item 3 at 7; Item 9 at 29.) \n \nSOR Allegations Added in the Amendment \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.y ($32,971) and SOR \u00b6 1.z ($17,109) are both judgments entered against \nApplicant in favor of two lenders to his business. Neither judgment is listed on credit \nreports in the record. However, Applicant listed both debts on his SCA, though the debt \nat \u00b6 1.y was listed as being owed to a different creditor. (SCA at 55-56.) He also \naddressed the status of both debts in his SOR Answer, and provided letters from the \njudgment creditors regarding settlement offers. (AE C; AE F)  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR on the basis of this information. Since \nApplicant did not respond to the SOR or to the FORM, I consider SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z to \nbe denied. However, the debts are established by Applicant\u2019s own statements in his SCA \nand by the settlement documents he provided with his Answer.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.y - The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.y was listed by Applicant in his SCA \nunder the name of a different creditor, but that creditor and debt were not listed among \nthe original SOR allegations. Applicant submitted with his SOR Answer a letter, dated \nOctober 22, 2018, from the lawyer of a judgment creditor agreeing to settle the debt with \nmonthly payments commencing on November 1, 2018, and ending on or about December \n1, 2022. This letter established this debt. Under this settlement, Applicant was obliged to \n\n9 \n \npay various amounts over that time period. At the time of his January 2020 SOR Answer, \nhe was obligated to pay $800 per month. He provided no documentary evidence that he \nwas making these payments. In addressing other debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant \nasserted that he was paying $1,125 towards two business debts. He did not identify the \ndebts, however, he provided documents identifying this business debt and the business \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.z. I accept Applicant\u2019s undisputed representation that he has \nbeen paying the monthly payments on the resolution of this judgment. This debt is being \nresolved. (Item 3 at 55-56; AE C at 1-2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.z - Applicant attached to his SOR Answer a letter, dated February 11, \n2019, regarding a proposed settlement agreement for the payment over time of a \njudgment in the amount of $17,109 entered on September 28, 2016, against Applicant \nand his business by a state court in a state other than where Applicant resided and \nconducted his business. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Applicant was \nobliged to make monthly payments in various amounts over time from February 2019 until \nlate 2020. At the time of Applicant\u2019s January 2020 SOR Answer, Applicant was obliged \nto pay $625 per month. The total of the two payments under the settlement terms of the \ntwo debts that Applicant was paying January 2020 would have been $1,425 ($800 plus \n$625), not the $1,125 amount Applicant claimed in his SOR Answer. Applicant provided \nno explanation for this discrepancy in his SOR Answer. Nevertheless, I accept Applicant\u2019s \nunchallenged representation that he has made his monthly payments under his \nsettlement agreement with this judgment creditor. This debt is being resolved. (SCA at \n55; AE F at 1-2.)  \n \nGuideline G:  \n \n \nThe SOR sets forth five allegations under Guideline G regarding Applicant\u2019s two \nalcohol-related arrests (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) and his participation in two alcohol \nawareness, recovery, and rehabilitation programs (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d). The SOR also \nalleges that he continued to drink alcohol until at least April 2019. In his January 2020 \nSOR Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations under Guideline G and provided \nsome additional information. He also wrote he no longer drinks alcohol and \u201cfrequently \nrefrain[s] from associated (sic) in places that will have alcohol.\u201d (Item 3 at 7-8.) \n \n \nShortly after midnight on November 2, 2014, the state police stopped Applicant\u2019s \ncar after observing that Applicant and a second driver appeared to be racing at a high \nrate of speed. After failing a set of field sobriety tests and registering a BAC of .13 in an \nalcohol breath-analysis test, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI) and certain other charges. Before his court case was finally adjudicated, \nhe was arrested again for DUI on August 2, 2015. He wrote in his SOR Answer that the \nsecond arrest occurred after he was involved in a single-vehicle accident. The charges \narising from the first arrest were subsequently dropped, and Applicant was given \nprobation before judgment on his second arrest and DUI charge. (Item 3 at 7-8; Item 7 at \n1-6, AE H; AE I.) \n \n\n10 \n \n \nFrom January to March 2015, Applicant participated in an alcohol and drug \nrecovery program. He attended six group sessions and was given a \u201cGood\u201d prognosis at \nthe time of discharge. On or about November 18, 2015, after his second DUI arrest on \nAugust 2, 2015, he completed a 26-session rehabilitation program, which began on \nSeptember 22, 2015. These programs are improperly alleged in the SOR as disqualifying. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2d.) Applicant completed a third alcohol program on March 23, 2019. He \nalso provided evidence that he completed a three-hour alcohol awareness program on \nNovember 6, 2014, shortly after his first arrest. He has never been diagnosed as having \nany issues or dependencies on alcohol. (Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 6-9.) \n \n \nApplicant responded to the Government\u2019s interrogatories on July 29, 2019, \nregarding his alcohol consumption. He wrote that he drank alcohol on two occasions in \n2019, once on January 11, 2019, and again on April 20, 2019. He reported that the last \ntime he drank alcohol to excess and became intoxicated was on December 14, 2018. He \ncommented that he has removed all alcohol from his home and aspires to be the best \nperson he can be for the sake of his youngest child. (Item 6 at 2-4.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n11 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.x establish the following \n\n12 \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \nAs discussed above, Applicant did not answer the SOR amendment and did not \nrespond to the FORM, so I consider SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z as denied. However, the record \nevidence includes statements from Applicant about the debts, both judgments to lenders, \nand related documentation. That evidence is sufficient to establish that AG \u00b619(a) and \n19(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z, as well.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24. 2013), the Appeal Board \nexplained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions \nas follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n \n\n13 \n \n \nThe record evidence does not support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e). \nApplicant\u2019s debts are numerous, recent, and most remain outstanding. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. Although he suggests that two debts are disputed because there are questions \nabout the identity of the legal owner of the debt (see SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t, above), he \nprovided no documentation to substantiate the basis of the disputes or actions he has \ntaken to resolve the disputes. In both cases, he committed in his SOR Answer to pay the \ndebts in 30 or 60 days, which shows that the debts are not really disputed. Thus, AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply to them.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) have partial application. Most of Applicant\u2019s debts arose \nbecause of the failure of his business. He also claims that he suffered some income loss \nwhen he lost one of his jobs. He incurred other losses when a tenant did not pay the rent \non Applicant\u2019s rental property and when a friend took money from his business. Applicant \ncan claim that his debts arose due to circumstances beyond his control and that he is \nmaking a good-faith effort to resolve some of his debts. Full application of these mitigating \nconditions, however, also requires that Applicant provide evidence that he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and that he is acting in good faith to resolve his \ndebts. Applicant began a business largely by using significant amounts of borrowed funds \nfrom credit cards and loans. The rapid failure of the business suggests that Applicant did \nnot have a realistic and responsible business plan when he started this business and \nincurred these debts. Moreover, Applicant has not provided any evidence of a plan to \nrepay his extraordinarily large number of debts. He presented evidence that he has made \na good-faith effort to pay three of his many business debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.y, and 1.z) and \nthe mortgage debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are also resolved. He also wrote in his SOR \nAnswer that he intended to pay five small debts in the near future (see SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.r, \n1.s, 1.t, and 1.x, above). He did not, however, provide any evidence that he paid these \ndebts.  \n \n \nApplicant wrote that he is committed to paying all of his debts, but he commented \nthat his financial resources are limited by his large child-support obligations. As noted \nabove, the burden is on Applicant to submit evidence of his actions and his plans for \nrepaying his debts. He has not provided a specific plan for repaying his numerous \noutstanding debts. Overall, he has not met his burden to justify full application of the \nmitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d).  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR answer to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n2.b and the documentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n\n14 \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nBoth mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant has had no arrests related to his \nuse of alcohol since August 2015. The circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s two DUI \narrests showed poor judgment at that time. Since then, and particularly since 2019, \nApplicant has shown more mature, reliable, and trustworthy behavior with respect to his \nuse of alcohol. He has acknowledged his past misuse of alcohol and has demonstrated \na clear and established pattern of modified consumption and even abstinence following \nhis multiple alcohol awareness classes. These actions provide substantial evidence that \nhe has taken steps to overcome his past poor judgment with respect to his consumption \nof alcohol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) fully apply, and Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his two past arrests for driving after drinking excessive amounts of \nalcohol. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant  \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n\n15 \n \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and G in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments are \nwarranted. Applicant voluntarily started a business based upon a hobby and financed the \nbusiness with a large amount of credit-card debts and loans. Within months, the business \n\u201cstalled\u201d and then closed with Applicant deeply in debt and defending lawsuits filed by \nthree creditors. Applicant paid one judgment and entered into payment plans to resolve \nthe other two lawsuits. He did not, however, present a plan for how he was going to pay \nor otherwise resolve the remaining debts within a reasonable period of time. Without \nevidence of such a plan, Applicant has not shown that he has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances he faced. Applicant has not satisfied his burden to establish mitigation \nof the serious security concerns raised by his significant indebtedness to a large number \nof creditors. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nG, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nwhile Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline G, he has not \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline F raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.x \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.y and 1.z: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 67-year-old married man with three children, ages 22, 19, and 15. He is a veteran of the U.S. Navy, serving honorably from 1971 to 1977. He is a high school graduate with a certification in radar technology, and has been working in the field of radar technology for various defense contractors since 2004. (Item 2 at 10) Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2018, resulting in delinquent debts totaling more than $100,000. In addition, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in April 2018, requesting the discharge of approximately $482,000 of debt, and he was evicted from his home in January 2019 after a foreclosure proceeding. (Item 2 at 2; Item 5 at 21; Item 1 at 5) In November 2018, the IRS contacted Applicant and notified him that he was claiming exemptions on his Employee\u2019s Withholding Certificate (W-4 form) to which he was not entitled. Moreover, the IRS instructed his employer not to honor Applicant\u2019s W-4 form or any new W-4 forms completed by Applicant. (Item 3 at 199, IRS letter to Applicant\u2019s employer, dated November 29, 2018). Applicant contends that he has no legal responsibility to pay federal income tax because the U.S. Constitution limits the federal government\u2019s authority to levy income taxes to residents of the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories or possessions.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance \neligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On December 27, 2019, \nApplicant answered the SOR, denying all of the allegations except subparagraphs 1.b \nand 1.k. He requested a decision without a hearing. On April 30, 2020, Applicant received \na copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Materials, and he was instructed to file any \n1 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobjections, or to supplement the file within 30 days of receipt. On June 5, 2020, Applicant \nfiled a response. Department Counsel did not object, whereupon the case was assigned \nto me on June 18, 2020. Applicant\u2019s response was incorporated in the record as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 67-year-old married man with three children, ages 22, 19, and 15. \nHe is a veteran of the U.S. Navy, serving honorably from 1971 to 1977. He is a high \nschool graduate with a certification in radar technology, and has been working in the field \nof radar technology for various defense contractors since 2004. (Item 2 at 10) \nApplicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 \nthrough 2018, resulting in delinquent debts totaling more than $100,000. In addition, he \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in April 2018, requesting the discharge of \napproximately $482,000 of debt, and he was evicted from his home in January 2019 after \na foreclosure proceeding. (Item 2 at 2; Item 5 at 21; Item 1 at 5) \nIn November 2018, the IRS contacted Applicant and notified him that he was \nclaiming exemptions on his Employee\u2019s Withholding Certificate (W-4 form) to which he \nwas not entitled. Moreover, the IRS instructed his employer not to honor Applicant\u2019s W-4 \nform or any new W-4 forms completed by Applicant. (Item 3 at 199, IRS letter to \nApplicant\u2019s employer, dated November 29, 2018). \nApplicant contends that he has no legal responsibility to pay federal income tax \nbecause the U.S. Constitution limits the federal government\u2019s authority to levy income \ntaxes to residents of the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories or possessions. (Item \n1 at 5) Moreover, Applicant characterizes the IRS\u2019 collection of income tax payments \nfrom citizens who have no Constitutionally-mandated responsibility to pay federal income \ntaxes, as \u201cthe largest financial crime in the history of the world.\u201d (Item 3 at 26) By \nextension, Applicant contends that any IRS garnishment of his pay is not valid. There is \nno record evidence of Applicant having pursued his arguments in the U.S. Tax Court. \nApplicant contends that the state taxing authority\u2019s notice of tax lien was invalid \nbecause it was filed using the wrong form and that absent \u201ca valid assessment and \nverified proof of claim under perjury and signed by someone who has authority to perform \nthis function,\u201d the state taxing authority has not established its contention that he owes \nany delinquent tax debt. (Item 1 at 6) There is no evidence that Applicant pursued this \nargument in the state tax court. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility shall be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Also, his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 to 2018 and pay taxes owed triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions requires consideration of the \nfollowing mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAccording to the U.S. Supreme Court, the belief that income tax law is per se \nunconstitutional and does not legally impose any duty is \u201cunsound,\u201d \u201cnot objectively \nreasonable,\u201d and \u201cfrivolous.\u201d (Cheek v. United States 498 U.S. 192, 205-206 (1991)) \nMoreover, DOHA proceedings are not the proper fora to entertain tax-protester \narguments. (ISCR Case No. 01-24356 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb 26, 2003)) Applicant provided \n4 \n\n \n_____________________ \nno evidence that he pursued his arguments in U.S. Tax Court or in his state tax court. \nMoreover, there is no track record of financial reform, particularly given the recency of the \nforeclosure of his home mortgage and the filing of his bankruptcy petition. Under these \ncircumstances, Applicant has not met the burden of proving that his delinquencies and \nhis failure to file his tax returns do not pose a security concern, and none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and they do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn August 14, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 26, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 9, 2019, and the hearing was \nheld on January 9, 2020. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-2, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as \nhearing exhibit (HE) I and the Government\u2019s discovery letter was marked as HE II. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-D, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 17, 2020. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the Guideline H allegations, with some \nexplanation. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He is single and has no children. He has been in a \nrelationship with his girlfriend for approximately five years. They bought a home and car \ntogether and reside together. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, as a systems analyst since January 2011. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nhas held a security clearance since 2008, when he was affiliated with the U.S. Navy. \n(Tr. at 28-30, 34-36; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about \n2012 to at least January 2019, while being granted access to classified information; and \nthat he intended to use marijuana in the future.  \n \n \n \nApplicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2010 when \nhe smoked it in a jurisdiction where it was illegal. He lives in a jurisdiction which has \nmade marijuana use legal. He continued to use marijuana through approximately \nJanuary 2019, after he completed his most recent security clearance application (SCA). \nBefore 2012, he used marijuana more than twice a week. From 2012 until his claimed \nabstinence in January 2019, he used marijuana about two times a week. He generally \nacquired the marijuana through friends either by purchase or gift. He typically used \nmarijuana in his home with his girlfriend, or with his friends, some of which are his \nneighbors, at their homes. (Tr. at 38-42, 45-47; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant was aware that his company had a drug policy, but he did not know \nwhat the policy was. His supervisor testified that the company policy is that drug use is \nprohibited by all employees. She also stated that all employees are made aware of the \ndrug policy. The company does not require drug-testing. Applicant stated in his SCA, his \nJanuary 2019 background investigation interview, and his SOR answer that he intended \nto continue to use marijuana, unless it affected his security clearance. He is aware that \nmarijuana use is incompatible with holding a security clearance. He testified that he now \nunderstands that drug use is a significant issue with the DOD and stated that he does \nnot intend to use in the future. He did not provide a written statement confirming such \n\n \n3 \n \n \nintent. He did not provide any documented drug counseling or treatment records. He \nprovided a drug test result from December 31, 2019, which showed a negative result for \nthe presence of marijuana. His girlfriend continues to use marijuana at least two times \nweekly. He claims she leaves the house to use marijuana so that he is not around when \nshe uses marijuana. He still associates with friends, including neighbors, who continue \nto use marijuana. (Tr. at 42-43, 48-53, 57-58; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified and provided a written letter supporting him. \nAnother coworker also provided a letter of support. Both opine that Applicant is \ntrustworthy and reliable. Applicant also provided a letter from a community member who \nrelated Applicant\u2019s volunteer work for his community. The author described Applicant as \n\u201ca kind, responsible person.\u201d (Tr. 56-58; AE A-C) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n4 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and   \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a regular basis from 2010 through possibly January \n2019. He used marijuana after being granted a secret clearance in 2008. In his answers \nto questions on his July 2018 SCA and in his answers to questions during his \nbackground investigation in January 2019, he stated his intent was to continue using \nmarijuana. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent and as recent as January 2019, while \nholding a security clearance and after he completed his latest SCA. Given his recent \npattern of use, his claimed abstinence, beginning in early 2019, is not sufficient to \novercome his recent drug use. He did not provide a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all future illegal drug use. Additionally, as recently as January 2019, he \nindicated his intent was to continue his use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s claimed recent \nabstention and one negative drug test are insufficient to convince me that recurrence is \nunlikely. The frequency and recency of his past use and his recent statement of intent to \ncontinue his use casts doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. He still associates with his live-in girlfriend, his friends, and neighbors who \ncontinue to use marijuana on a regular basis. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.   \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s \ntestimony, his letters of support, his recent negative drug-test results, and his testimony \ndeclaring his intention of no future marijuana use. However, I also considered that he \nused marijuana on numerous occasions while holding a security clearance and that as \nrecently as January 2019, he expressed his intent to continue using marijuana. It was \nonly after he realized that using marijuana jeopardized his security clearance that he \nhad a change of heart concerning his future intentions.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a - 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 21, 2019.  He requested that his case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 1.)  \nOn November 18, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. \nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven Items, was \nmailed to Applicant and received by him on November 25, 2019.  The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  Applicant \nsubmitted no response to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Government Items 1 \nthrough 7, and they are admitted into evidence, referenced hereinafter as Government \nExhibits 1 through 7.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 47 years old.  He has an Associate\u2019s degree.  He is employed by a \ndefense contractor as a Graphic Artist.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant incurred delinquent debt totaling approximately \n$62,000 which include educational loans, medical bills, and numerous charge-off \naccounts.  He also failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns on a timely \nbasis for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017.  In his answer, he admits each of the debts \nlisted in the SOR, but provides no further details.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated \nMay 12, 2011; December 18, 2018; June 4, 2019; and November 8, 2019, confirm this \nindebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7.)  Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer in November 2013. In his security clearance application dated \nSeptember 20, 2018, Applicant indicates that his household went from two incomes to \none at some point, which obviously contributed to his financial problems.  There is \nnothing more said about his finances to gleen any further understanding of his situation.   \n   \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army for four years from June 1991 to \nJune 1995, and received an honorable discharge.   \n \n \nFor some unknown reason, Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in a timely fashion.  He now claims that at \nthe time he submitted his answer to the SOR, these returns were being filed, however, \nhe provides no documentary evidence to support this assertion. \n \nApplicant provides no explanation as to how or why he accrued this delinquent \ndebt.  The following delinquent debt remains owing: \n \n1.a.  A delinquent educational debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $10,014.     \n \n1.b.  A delinquent educational debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $9,605.    \n\n \n3 \n \n1.c  A  delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate \namount of $7,379.   \n \n1.d.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate \namount of $6,475.  \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $5,954.  \n \n1.f.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $3,019. \n \n1.g.  A delinquent medical account in the approximate amount of $2,285.   \n \n1.h.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $1,790. \n \n1.i.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $1,742.  \n \n1.j.  A delinquent educational debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $1,590.  \n \n1.k.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $683. \n \n1.l.  A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $363.  \n \n1.m.  A delinquent educational debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $5,789. \n \n1.n.  A delinquent educational debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $4,745. \n \n1.o.  A delinquent educational debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $1,287. \n \n1.p.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$1,664. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid.  At this time \nthere is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he is financially stable, or \nthat he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources available to handle \nhis financial obligations.  There is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts, or that even one of \nthem has been paid off.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n \n  \nApplicant mentions in his security clearance application that his two income \nhousehold was reduced to one income, but provides no further details about this \nsituation.  Without more information, the record is void of mitigation.  There is no \nevidence in the record to show that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control \ncontributed to his financial difficulties.  There is nothing in the record to show how or \nwhy Applicant became so delinquently indebted.  Nor is there evidence to show that \nApplicant has made any effort to resolve his debts.  Applicant has been gainfully \nemployed since November 2013 and remains excessively indebted.  None of the \nmitigating conditions apply.   \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.:, through 1.r.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/30/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nHistory of the Case \nOn November 5, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 18, 2019. The case was reassigned to me \non February 3, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on February 5, 2020, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nMarch 5, 2020. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted \ninto evidence without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list was marked as \n\n \n2 \n \nhearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified at the hearing, and offered exhibits (AE) A \nthrough M, which were admitted without objection. Applicant submitted one post-hearing \nexhibit, AE N, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 13, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working \nat her present job in August 2018. She has a high school diploma and has taken some \ncollege courses. She is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. at 6, 25; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her 2012-2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns as required; and that she was indebted on two charged-off credit \ncards totaling approximately $7,800. She admitted failing to file her federal and state tax \nreturns during her December 2018 background interview and when she answered \ninterrogatories in September 2019. The charged-off debts were listed in a credit report \nfrom January 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d). (GE 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant attributed her tax-filing problems, beginning in 2012, to the break-up of \na nine-year engagement; transitioning into a new job; being involved in a car accident; \nbeing arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol; and being advised by an \nattorney that she would not qualify for bankruptcy. She calculated that she owed \napproximately $6,000 for her 2012 federal taxes. She decided not to file her 2012 \nfederal or state tax returns because she did not have the funds to pay the taxes owed. \nApplicant also did not timely file her 2011 federal and state tax returns. This year is not \nalleged in the SOR and this evidence will not be considered for disqualification \npurposes, however, I may use it to consider the applicability of mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person considerations. (Tr. 26, 33; AE D) \n \n \nIn early 2014, after receiving some financial counseling, Applicant received \nassistance from a bookkeeping service, which prepared her 2011-2013 federal and \nstate tax returns. Applicant filed those returns in June 2014, making them all untimely \nfilings. (2013 was untimely because no extension was requested) Additionally, at the \ntime she filed the returns, she failed to pay the federal taxes owed for 2012 and 2013. \nHer failure to pay her taxes also will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but \nmay be considered for mitigation and whole-person considerations. (Tr. 27; AE C, D, J) \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her 2014-2018 federal and state tax returns. In late \nJuly or early August 2019, Applicant hired an accountant, and she filed her 2014-2018 \nfederal and state tax returns. She also made a series of payments to the IRS in July \n2019, August 2019, and November 2019 that resolved her federal tax debt for all years. \nShe also presented documentation showing that she filed all required state tax returns \nand paid all taxes owed. Applicant was able to pay a large part of her tax debt from the \n\n \n3 \n \nproceeds of a car accident settlement she received. All of her tax filings and payments \n(for tax years 2014-2018) came after she received interrogatories in this case. (Tr. 29-\n32, 36-38; GE 2; AE A, B, E-H, N) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she stopped paying on the two delinquent credit cards \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) in 2013. She claims that she called the creditor for these accounts and \nwas told that the debts were uncollectable because of the statute of limitations. She also \npointed out that neither debt is listed in her two credit reports from February 2020. Both \ndebts are listed in the Government-provided credit report from January 2020. The debts \nwere charged off and reflect the date of the first major delinquency as October 2013. \n(Tr. 27-28, 39; GE 3; AE I, M)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is approximately $60,000. She currently maintains \nabout $6,000 in her checking and savings accounts combined. She has a retirement \naccount with approximately $30,000 invested and a separate investment account \nvalued at about $7,000. She has resided with her parents since 2013, but does not pay \nthem rent. She assists with the household expenses. She has no other major expense \nitems. She claims to have filed her 2019 federal tax return. (Tr. 42-44) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant failed to file her 2012-2018 federal and state income tax returns and is \nresponsible for two charged-off credit cards. While she ultimately filed all of her federal \nand state tax returns for years 2012-2018, all were filed late. She provided no \ndocumentation showing payment of the delinquent credit cards. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit cards remain unpaid since 2013. She failed to produce \nevidence showing that recurrence of her financial problems is unlikely. Her inability to \naddress these two debts in the past seven years is a poor reflection of her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant presented evidence that she faced some circumstances in 2013 that \nwere beyond her control, such as her break-up with her fianc\u00e9, and her job change. \nHowever, her driving under the influence arrest was caused by her own misconduct. \nAdditionally, these events occurred in approximately 2013. Applicant has had sufficient \ntime to address her tax issues and delinquent credit cards since then, but has only \nrecently taken action. She filed her delinquent tax returns from 2014-2018 after she \nreceived the interrogatories in this case. She did not make any payments toward the \ncharged-off credit cards in the past seven years when she was gainfully employed. \n\n \n6 \n \nOverall, the record evidence does not support that Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence of financial counseling. She finally \naddressed her federal and state tax issues in late July 2019. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable. \nHer two delinquent credit cards remain unpaid. She believes the statute of limitations \nmakes those debts unenforceable. While that may be true, for the purpose of seeking a \nsecurity clearance, relying on a legal remedy, does not amount to a good-faith effort to \nresolve the debts. None of the remaining mitigating conditions fully apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, and the circumstances \nsurrounding her indebtedness. However, I also considered that she has made no efforts \nto resolve her debts and only filed her federal and state tax returns after receiving \ninterrogatories for this case. She has not established a meaningful track record of debt \nmanagement, which causes me to question her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.)   \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.d  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for access \nto sensitive information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines E \n(personal conduct) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on \nAugust 27, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on December 10, 2019, \nand reassigned to me on January 8, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 23, 2019, scheduling the hearing for \nJanuary 15, 2020. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \nadditional information. She submitted documents that I have marked AE E through O \nand admitted without objection. Several of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were duplicates. I have \nincluded the duplicate copies for completeness. \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 2.e by adding the words \u201cfederal \nand,\u201d and by changing the year \u201c2017\u201d to \u201c2018\u201d was granted without objection. SOR \u00b6 \n2.e now reads as follows: \n \nYou failed to file, as required, federal and [state] income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011 through 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since October 2018. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree that she earned \nin 2017. She married in 1980 and divorced in 1983. She does not have children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 12, 36, 56; GE 1, 5; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant worked in human resources for a county government from 2006 to \n2018. She received written disciplinary action in February 2015 for \u201cunacceptable \npersonal conduct.\u201d The county determined that she engaged in conduct that could be \nperceived as a conflict of interest. (Tr. at 46; GE 1, 2; AE A, D, E, G, I-L) \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from her county position in July 2018 for \u201cgrossly \ninefficient job performance and unacceptable personal conduct.\u201d She filed for \nunemployment insurance benefits, which were initially denied. An employee in her state \ncan be denied unemployment benefits if the employee is unemployed because she was \ndischarged for misconduct connected with her work. Applicant appealed, and a hearing \nwas held with Applicant and two county employees as witnesses. Applicant won her \nappeal. The Appeals Referee determined that the allegations were not supported by the \nweight of the evidence, and that Applicant \u201cwas not discharged for misconduct \nconnected with the work.\u201d (Tr. at 27-34, 37; GE 1, 3, 5; AE B, C, E, F, H) \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunfiled federal and state income tax returns. The SOR alleges the unfiled tax returns \nand four delinquent debts totaling about $16,400. The debts are for clothing ($885), a \ntimeshare ($10,966), medical expenses ($4,013), and a bank credit card ($585). The \n\n \n3 \nallegations are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and a November 2018 credit \nreport. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE N) \n \n \nApplicant successfully worked in a metropolitan area until her fianc\u00e9 passed \naway in about 2000. She attributed her financial problems to moving to an economically \ndepressed rural area in about 2000 to care for her mother. She experienced \nunemployment and underemployment. She lost work while caring for ill relatives, and \nshe incurred expenses for their funerals after they passed away, including her mother \nwho passed away shortly before Applicant\u2019s hearing. She also had educational \nexpenses and her own medical issues. (Tr. at 35-38, 43, 58; GE 1, 5) \n \n \nApplicant did not file her federal and state income tax returns when they were \ndue for tax years 2011 through 2018. She stated that she was informed by a friend that \nshe was exempt from filing tax returns if she completed a certain form. She was unable \nto identify what form, and she admitted that she never filed any such form with the IRS. \nShe also stated that she thought the exemption might have been based on working for a \nnon-profit organization, but she admitted that she worked for a county government. She \nhad not filed any of her returns as of the date of her hearing. She stated that her state \ngarnished her wages, and that she owed the state about $10,000. (Tr. at 39-48; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5) \n \n \nApplicant stated that she is now able to address her financial issues, and she \nplans to do so. She received financial counseling in about 2018. She submitted copies \nof her federal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. They were signed on April 21, \n2020. The returns do not indicate that Applicant owes any federal taxes for those years. \nShe did not submit any information about the other unfiled federal and state income tax \nreturns. She indicated that she was waiting for an offer-in-compromise from her state to \nsettle her delinquent state taxes. She did not provide information about what, if anything, \nis owed to the IRS. She did not pay any of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 43, 56-\n57; GE 1; AE I, M) \n \n \nApplicant provided copies of her performance appraisals from the county \ngovernment. She was regarded as a trusted and valuable employee. (AE F, O) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \n\n \n4 \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe trustworthiness concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as \nfollows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. AG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate those concerns. The \nfollowing disqualifying and mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n \n\n \n5 \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources;  \n \n16(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual \nto the employer as a condition of employment;  \n17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur;  \n17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n17(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nThe SOR alleges two instances of personal conduct in one allegation: the 2015 \ncounseling and the 2018 termination. The 2015 counseling is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. However, that was a single incident five years ago, for \nwhich Applicant was not terminated. That conduct is mitigated. After a full hearing by \nher state, Applicant was determined to have not committed the misconduct that resulted \nin her 2018 termination. That part of the allegation is unsubstantiated.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n6 \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She did not file her 2011 through \n2018 federal and state income tax returns when they were due, and she has several \ndelinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s life changed drastically after her fianc\u00e9 passed away in about 2000. \nShe moved to an economically depressed rural area to care for her mother. She \nexperienced unemployment and underemployment. She lost work while caring for ill \n\n \n7 \nrelatives, and she incurred expenses for their funerals after they passed away. \nApplicant is in many respects an admirable woman. It is completely understandable that \nshe has experienced financial difficulties. It is not understandable that she has done \nalmost nothing about her finances. Her shirking of her tax responsibilities is particularly \negregious. \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018).  \n \n \nApplicant stated that she intends to file her tax returns and pay her debts and \ntaxes. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. Her financial issues are \nrecent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the trustworthiness concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns and delinquent debts are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n8 \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable work record and the personal sacrifices she endured to help her family. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct trustworthiness concerns, but she did not mitigate the \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He \nresolved eight of the ten delinquent accounts alleged in the Statement of Reasons \n(SOR). He is currently unemployed but has acquired no additional delinquent accounts. \nGiven the opportunity, he would continue resolving the two remaining delinquent \naccounts. He mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 24, 2018. He \nwas interviewed by a government investigator on October 4, 2018. After reviewing the \ninformation gathered during the background investigation, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) issued an SOR on August 9, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on September 4, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on February 10, 2020. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on February 27, 2020, setting the hearing for March 6, 2020. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15-day advance notice \nof the date of his hearing. (Tr. 12-14) At the hearing, the Government offered four \nexhibits (GE 1 through 4). Applicant testified and submitted nine exhibits (AE 1 through \n9). AE 7 through 9 were received post-hearing. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. Hearing exhibit (HE) 1 is the Government\u2019s discovery letter that I marked and \nmade part of the record. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 16, 2020. \nHE 2 is a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS - Joint Adjudication Management \nSystem (JAMS)) document Department Counsel produced at my request on April 14, \n2020, showing that Applicant is being sponsored by a federal contractor. Thus, DOHA \nhas jurisdiction to adjudicate the case. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the financial allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.i, with comments. He did not address the allegation under \u00b6 1.j, so I considered it \ndenied. His SOR admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He graduated from high school in 2010. He has never \nbeen married, but adopted a child, age 10.  \n \nApplicant worked as a security guard for different employers between 2010 and \nNovember 2017. He was unemployed between November 2017 and June 2018. A \nfederal contractor hired him in June 2018. He was granted an interim security clearance \nin April 2019. He worked for this employer until his interim clearance was withdrawn as \na result of the concerns alleged in the SOR, and he was then laid off in December 2019. \nHe testified that he has a new prospective employer, a federal contractor who promised \nhim a position if he is granted clearance eligibility. HE 2 shows that Applicant is being \nsponsored by a federal contractor.  \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2018 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed a defaulted car loan he cosigned for his 50-year-old aunt. The background \ninvestigation addressed his financial problems and the 10 delinquent accounts alleged \nin the SOR. The status of those accounts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($18,258) alleges a defaulted car loan Applicant cosigned for his 50-\nyear-old aunt in 2015. She failed to make the payments, the car was repossessed, and \nit was sold at auction. His aunt intends to file bankruptcy to resolve her debts. Applicant \nis trying to determine whether his aunt\u2019s eventual bankruptcy discharge would also \nrelease him of financial responsibility. Applicant explained that he was unable to make \nthe loan payments because at the time his aunt defaulted on the loan, he was involved \nin a serious car accident and was not working. He did not have the financial means to \npay this debt. This account is unresolved. (Tr. 30-34) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,603) alleged a medical account in collection. Applicant paid the \naccount in August 2019. (AE 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($863) alleged an Internet services provider account in collection. \nApplicant established the account in 2018 for a close friend, and she failed to make the \npayments. He stated that she told him she was going to pay the debt but has failed to \ndo so. The account is unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($827) alleged an overdraft bank account in collection from August \n2018. Applicant paid the account in August 2019. (AE 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($46) alleged a medical account in collection. Applicant paid the \naccount in January 2019. (AE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($148) alleged a medical account in collection. Applicant paid the \naccount in January 2019. (AE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($461) alleged a medical account in collection. Applicant paid the \naccount in August 2019. (AE 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($780) alleged a medical account in collection. Applicant paid the \naccount in September 2019. (AE 6) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($45) alleged a medical account in collection. Applicant paid the \naccount in September 2019. (AE 6) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($21,125) alleged a hospital-services account in collection. The \naccount concerns medical bills Applicant incurred after a serious auto accident. He \nbelieved the account was paid with the proceeds of a lawsuit he brought against the \nother driver\u2019s insurance company. Applicant\u2019s attorney indicated that the other driver\u2019s \ninsurance ($30,000) was inadequate to cover all the hospital expenses ($65,000). (AE \n7) \n \nApplicant explained that his financial problems resulted from several factors. In \nMarch 2016, he was involved in a severe car accident. Most of the medical debts \nalleged in the SOR resulted from his car accident because at the time he did not have \nmedical insurance. The other accounts became delinquent because of his inability to \nwork while convalescing. Additionally, he was laid off from his job and unemployed from \nNovember 2017 to June of 2018. Because of his lack of earnings, he did not have the \nfinancial means to address his delinquent accounts. \n \nApplicant testified that he is trying to do the right thing - to stay on the right path. \nHe is new to the security clearance process and did not know that the background \ninvestigation would scrutinize his financial situation. He believes that the clearance \nprocess is helping him to become a better person, to become financially responsible, \nand able to honor his financial obligations. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant resolved several of the SOR debts while he was working and able to do \nso, before he was laid off after his interim clearance was revoked in December 2019. \nHe currently does not have a job or the financial means to address his debts. He \nintends to call his creditors and to try to make payment arrangement with his mother\u2019s \nfinancial help. He noted that his mother has been helping him to pay some of his debts. \nHe intends to determine whether she can help him to set up additional payment \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant believes that he has learned a hard lesson as a result of his financial \nproblems. He promised not to cosign any additional loans or to open accounts for \nanyone else in the future. He plans to address his remaining delinquent debts as soon \nas he finds employment. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be \nconsidered.  [First time SEAD used] \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems and the 10 SOR delinquent debts and collection \naccounts are documented in the record. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to \nsatisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablished these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are partially or fully \nraised by the facts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant developed \nfinancial problems, in part, because he was involved in a serious car accident in 2016. \nMost of the medical accounts alleged in the SOR resulted from his car accident. He was \nunable to work for a period after his accident, and was unemployed from November \n2017 to June 2018. Additionally, he was laid off because of the SOR concerns in \nDecember 2019. Thus, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are attributed, to some extent, to \ncircumstances beyond his control. \n \nIt also appears that Applicant\u2019s 50-year-old aunt took advantage of him by asking \nhim to cosign a car loan for her, and that he was na\u00efve when he opened an Internet \naccount for a close friend who then failed to honor her promises to pay the charges. He \ncredibly explained that he will not cosign loans or accounts for others in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that he paid off eight of the ten alleged \ndelinquent accounts. Only the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.j. are unresolved, \nand he credibly indicated his intent to address those two remaining accounts when he is \nfinancially able to do so. Applicant has demonstrated financial responsibility by paying \noff eight of the SOR accounts, and he has acquired no additional delinquencies.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant could have demonstrated better judgment by not cosigning a \ncar loan for his aunt and not opening an account for a friend, I find that he has been \nfinancially responsible under his circumstances. Applicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to \ndemonstrate his current financial responsibility, and that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved commensurate with his financial ability. I believe that given the \nopportunity, Applicant will establish payment arrangements to resolve the two remaining \ndelinquent accounts. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 28, was hired by a federal contractor in June 2018. He was granted an \ninterim security clearance in April 2019. He worked for this employer until his clearance \nwas withdrawn as a result of the SOR concerns in August 2019, and he was then laid \noff in December 2019. Applicant has a new prospective employer (a federal contractor) \nwho promised him a position if he is granted clearance eligibility.  \n \nApplicant paid off eight of the ten SOR delinquent accounts. His evidence is \nsufficient to establish that circumstances beyond his control contributed to or \naggravated his financial problems. After that, he has been financially responsible \ncommensurate with his limited financial resources. Given the opportunity, Applicant will \ncontinue to resolve the two remaining delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 and 13.) He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree, and two Master\u2019s Degrees from American universities. (TR at page 15 lines 6~19.)

(TR at page 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppX F.) It was deregistered in the United States and Pakistan in in 2019, as evidenced by formal documentation submitted by Applicant on behalf of his former business.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 12, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on December \n16, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on December 16, 2019, scheduling the hearing for January 6, 2020. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2, \nwhich were admitted without objection, and Hearing Exhibit (HX) I for Administrative \nNotice. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and offered 12 documents, which I marked \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through P, and admitted into evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (TR) on January 14, 2020. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to The Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Department Counsel provided a six-\npage summary of the facts, supported by seven Government documents pertaining to \nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, identified as HE I. The documents provide elaboration \nand context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nU.S. Government reports.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 13.) He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree, and two Master\u2019s Degrees from American \nuniversities. (TR at page 15 lines 6~19.) Applicant has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since April of 2017. (GX 1 at page 13, and TR at page 59 line 20 to page 61 \nline 18.) He is married to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1 at pages 21~22.) \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a.~1.d. Applicant categorically denies these allegations regarding a former \nbusiness interest in Pakistan. His American company dealt with solar panels. (TR at \npage 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppX F.) It was deregistered in the United States \nand Pakistan in in 2019, as evidenced by formal documentation submitted by Applicant \non behalf of his former business. (TR at page 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppXs A \nand E.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s enrolment with the solar panel company was never \u201chidden,\u201d as \nalleged. This is clear from the registration and deregistration documentation, noted \nabove. He did draft email correspondence to Pakistan\u2019s Minister of Finance (AppX B), \nbut it was for his American nephew, who was the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer. \n(TR at page 27 line 5 to page 30 line 1, at page 46 line 22 to page 48 line 10, and AppX \nC.) \n \n \nWhile the former company did employ six Pakistani relatives, it\u2019s foreign bank \naccounts have been closed, as evidenced by banking documentation. (TR at page 30 \nline 2 to page 32 line 7, and AppXs G and H.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant\u2019s 70 year-old mother and 74 year-old father are dual nationals with \nPakistan. (TR at page 32 line 8 to page 34 line 10, and GX 1 at pages 24~28.) His \n\n \n3 \n \nmother is not employed and his father is retired from a U.S. state \u201ctransit authority.\u201d (Id.) \nApart from their primary residence in the United States, \u201cthey own a house in . . . [their] \nvillage,\u201d which they visit \u201conce every two years . . . [for] about three months\u201d at a time. \n(TR at page 32 line 8 to page 33 line 17.) \n \n \n1.f. and 1.g. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR \nat page 34 lines 11~14.) Between 2013~2016, Applicant lent his mother-in-law about \n$35,723 to fund the brother-in-law\u2019s \u201cstartup home building business,\u201d and to \u201chelp build \na family home\u201d for his mother-in-law in Pakistan. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 37 line \n15.) These monies have been repaid, and Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law now lives in the \nUnited States. (TR at page 62 line 7 to page 64 line 2, and AppXs M and N.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 37 \nline 16 to page 38 line 23.) \u201cHe works . . . on a dairy farm.\u201d As they speak different \ndialects, Applicant has spoken to his father-in-law in person \u201cprobably [only] five times\u201d \nduring the 12 years that he has been married. (Id.) \n \n \n1.i.  Applicant\u2019s male cousin is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 38 \nline 24 to page 40 line 15.) He is \u201ca barber.\u201d (TR at page 64 line 16 to page 65 line 4.) \nApplicant has spoken to his cousin \u201cfive to 10 times over the last 40 years. (TR at page \n38 line 24 to page 40 line 15.) \n \n \n1.j. Applicant\u2019s uncle is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 40 line 11 \nto page 41 line 4.) He is also \u201ca barber.\u201d (TR at page 65 lines 5~8.) Applicant has met \nwith or spoken to his uncle perhaps only three times. (TR at page 40 line 11 to page 41 \nline 5.) \n \n \n1.k. Over the last 13 years, since 2007, Applicant has provided his Pakistani \nfamily about $4,000, normally in increments of $300~$500 pursuant, to the Muslim \ntradition \u201ccalled Zakth.\u201d (TR at page 41 line 5 to page 42 line 16.) \n \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding The Islamic Republic \nof Pakistan: Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. The U.S. State Department \nhas issued a Level 3; Reconsider travel advisory to Pakistan due to terrorism. The \nPakistani military and intelligence services nominally reported to civilian authorities but \nessentially operate without effective civilian oversight. (HE 1 at pages 1~5.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n \n5 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest  \n \n  \nApplicant owned a solar panel business that was run by his American nephew in \nPakistan. He also has Pakistani relatives to whom he lent and gave monies. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has discontinued his business in Pakistan. Those monies loaned to his \nmother-in-law, who is a U.S. citizen, living in the United States, have been paid back. \nThose monies given to his Pakistani relatives, about $4,000 over a period of 13 years, is \nde minimus at best. Two are barbers, and the other works on a dairy farm. Foreign \nInfluence is found for Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant is well respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppX D.) His \nPakistani contacts are infrequent, at best. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States due to his longstanding ties here.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.~1.k: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and Applicant\u2019s December 30, 2019 response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 29-year-old dual citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia. He was born in the United States to Saudi citizens. (Item 3.) The FORM does not contain any explanation for why his parents were in the United States at the time of his birth in 1990. On his June 25, 2019 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), Applicant explained that his father was from a royal family in Yemen that was forced to flee the country after its 1962 civil war, and that Saudi Arabia gave the family asylum and allowed his father to keep his family title. (Item 3.) Applicant told an authorized investigator for the OPM on December 14, 2015, that his family emigrated as refugees from Yemen to Saudi Arabia in the 1960s. (Item 4.) His SF 86 indicates that his mother was born in Egypt. (Item 3.) Applicant has four siblings: two sisters ages 34 and 21 and two brothers ages 38 and 31.

Applicant attended college in the United States on a $200,000 scholarship from \nthe Saudi Arabian government. He has yet to establish longstanding and deep ties to the \nUnited States. The foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a \npublic trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn September 6, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 28, \n2019, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six \nexhibits (Items 1-6). On October 29, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him that any response \nwas due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on November 6, 2019. \nNo response was received by the December 6, 2019 deadline. On January 8, 2020, the \ncase was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests \nof national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the \ncase file on January 13, 2020, and I issued a decision on Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility on January 29, 2020. \nOn January 29, 2020, after the decision was issued, I was notified by Department \nCounsel that Applicant had submitted a late response to the FORM on December 30, \n2019, in which he indicated, in part, that he requires a position of trust and not a DOD \nsecurity clearance. I was also informed that, on January 24, 2020, DOHA had confirmed \nwith Applicant\u2019s security manager that Applicant is currently being sponsored for a public \ntrust position to access sensitive finance and budget information for the DOD. After the \nclose of business on January 29, 2020, Department Counsel submitted a memorandum \nfor the record requesting a decision on Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position and \nasserting that the same standards and adjudicative guidelines apply in security clearance \neligibility and trustworthiness cases. Included with that memorandum were Applicant\u2019s \nDecember 30, 2019 response to the FORM and email correspondence of January 24, \n2020, between DOHA and Applicant\u2019s security manager. After reviewing that \ndocumentation, on January 30, 2020, I vacated my decision of January 29, 2020, and \ninformed the parties that I would issue a decision on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness after \nconsidering the Government\u2019s FORM, supplemented by Department Counsel\u2019s \nDecember 30, 2019 memorandum, and Applicant\u2019s December 30, 2019 rebuttal to the \nFORM, which is incorporated in the record as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \nProcedural Ruling \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that the information he is \u201cprivy to \nis a low-impact security risk,\u201d and that he does not access a classified network or system \nin the performance of his duties. (AE A.) To the extent that he argues for a more lenient \nstandard than had he been applying for security clearance eligibility, positions designated \nas ADI or ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d See Code of Federal Regulations \nTitle 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13, and part 154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position \nCategories and Criteria for Designating Positions. The Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, \nindicates that trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the \nDefense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management (OPM). DOD contractor \npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6, \nand the standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is that set forth in Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) pertinent to security clearances, which is whether \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.

See e.g., ADP Case \nNo. 15-04852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2017). \nEvidentiary Ruling \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 4, summary reports of personal subject \ninterviews (PSI) of Applicant conducted in person on December 14, 2015, February 11, \n2016, and February 17, 2016; and by telephone on December 15, 16, and 17, 2015. The \nsummary reports were part of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise \nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary reports did not bear the \nauthentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal \nBoard held that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a \nsummary of personal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his \nor her opportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no \nobjection to it; and there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate \ninformation. In this case, Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his \nopportunity to submit objections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to \nconsider. In a footnote in the FORM, Applicant was advised as follows: \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interviews (PSI) is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to the File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on \nwhether [the] PSI summary accurately reflects the information you provided \nto the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear \nand accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that the report is \nunauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are raised in \nyour response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections \nto the admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as \nevidence in your case. \nApplicant submitted a late response to the FORM in which he did not comment \nabout the PSI. Concerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication \nor the legal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due \nprocess rights or protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal \ncounsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 \nE3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance or trustworthiness \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. While the Directive does not specifically provide for a waiver of the \nauthentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to \nobject to the admissibility of the interview summary reports, to comment on the interview \nsummaries, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the \nreports. In the absence of any objections, I accepted Item 4 in evidence, subject to issues \nof relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nAdministrative Notice \nThe Government requested administrative notice of several facts pertaining to the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) (Item 5) and the Republic of Egypt (Egypt) (Item \n6), as set forth in respective Request(s) for Administrative Notice, dated October 2, 2019. \nThe request pertaining to Saudi Arabia was based on five publications from the U.S. State \nDepartment. The request pertaining to Egypt was based on six publications from the U.S. \nState Department. I was provided extracts of the cited documents and the URLs where I \ncould obtain the full documents. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so he is found \nto have waived any objections to the administrative notice requests or to the facts set \nforth therein. Appeal Board precedent, set forth in ISCR Case No. 05-11292, dated April \n12, 2007, requires that the administrative judge consider the most current political \nconditions in a foreign country when evaluating Guideline B cases. Accordingly, I \nreviewed the full text of the publications relied on by the Government for administrative \nnotice, and took administrative notice of the facts set forth below. \nSummary of SOR Allegations and Response \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of \nFrance and Saudi Arabia (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and one of his \nsisters (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are citizens of Saudi Arabia and reside with him in the United States; \nthat Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Saudi Arabia residing in Egypt (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that \nApplicant\u2019s other sister and his two brothers are dual U.S.-Saudi citizens residing in Saudi \nArabia (SOR \u00b6 1.e); that Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are dual citizens of France and the \nUnited States residing in Saudi Arabia (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that Applicant sought and \nreceived on the basis of his Saudi citizenship a $200,000 scholarship from the Saudi \ngovernment in 2011 to pursue his bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States, which he earned \nin 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). (Item 1.) \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations, but indicated \nthat Saudi Arabia and France are close allies of the United States; that his spouse and \nmother are \u201cGreen Card\u201d holders (U.S. permanent residency status); and that none of \nhis relatives have any ties to an organization or government that would jeopardize the \ninterests of the United States. Applicant described his father as \u201ca visible man,\u201d who owns \na film animation studio in Egypt that is releasing its first feature film set to debut in \ninternational film festivals. Applicant stated that his sister and brothers in Saudi Arabia \nhave good business opportunities: one brother works for a U.S.-based credit lender; his \nother brother works for a Saudi oil company; and his sister owns \u201cher own artistic co-\nworking space.\u201d Applicant asserted about his college scholarship that he had an \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cunbelievable opportunity to attend university for free and have a monthly stipend for living \nexpenses.\u201d He explained that it would have been \u201cirresponsible\u201d of him to decline that \nopportunity and added that he was only one of hundreds of thousands of Saudis who \nhave benefitted from such a scholarship in the United States. Applicant indicated that he \nhas chosen to live \u201cas a proud American and will continue to live in the United States.\u201d \n(Item 2.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the foreign or dual citizenships of his family members; \nto the Saudi residency of his sister, two brothers, and parents-in-law; to the Egyptian \nresidency of his father; and to his college scholarship from the Saudi government, are \naccepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the FORM, which \nincludes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and Applicant\u2019s December 30, 2019 response \nto the FORM (AE A), I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 29-year-old dual citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia. He \nwas born in the United States to Saudi citizens. (Item 3.) The FORM does not contain any \nexplanation for why his parents were in the United States at the time of his birth in 1990. \nOn his June 25, 2019 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), Applicant \nexplained that his father was from a royal family in Yemen that was forced to flee the \ncountry after its 1962 civil war, and that Saudi Arabia gave the family asylum and allowed \nhis father to keep his family title. (Item 3.) Applicant told an authorized investigator for the \nOPM on December 14, 2015, that his family emigrated as refugees from Yemen to Saudi \nArabia in the 1960s. (Item 4.) His SF 86 indicates that his mother was born in Egypt. (Item \n3.) \nApplicant has four siblings: two sisters ages 34 and 21 and two brothers ages 38 \nand 31. According to his SF 86, his 21-year-old sister was born in Egypt while his other \nsiblings were born in the United States. Applicant and his siblings acquired Saudi \ncitizenship through their parents. (Item 3.) Applicant told an OPM investigator that he lived \nin Egypt and Saudi Arabia as a minor. (Item 4.) \nApplicant moved to Saudi Arabia in August 2004 and acquired his Saudi \ncitizenship in approximately July 2006. Applicant acquired a passport from Saudi Arabia \nin late August 2006, which he renewed over the years. His current Saudi passport expires \nin December 2021. Applicant traveled extensively on his Saudi passport to countries in \nthe region (Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Egypt) between July \n2007 and October 2010. (Items 3-4.) \nAfter passing examinations in Saudi Arabia, Applicant came to the United States. \nHe had recently obtained his U.S. passport on December 4, 2010, and he lived with an \nuncle in the United States for the next year. According to Applicant, his uncle is a Saudi \ncitizen who has never been employed in the United States and has no affiliation with a \nforeign government, military, security, defense industry, or intelligence service. Applicant \nobtained his General Education Diploma (GED) and pursued studies at a community \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncollege until August 2011, when he enrolled in a four-year university in the United States \non a full scholarship funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government. Over the next four years, he \nalso received a monthly stipend of $1,850 from the Saudi government to cover his living \nexpenses as well as health insurance. Applicant obtained the scholarship based on his \nSaudi citizenship. While pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree, which he earned in May 2015, \nApplicant had quarterly contact with a local advisor from the Saudi Arabian Cultural \nMission, to whom he had to submit his transcripts. (Items 2-4.) Applicant indicates that he \nhad to meet \u201ccertain requirements\u201d while in school, although he did not specify the \nrequirements. He denies any contact with the advisor since he graduated, and there is no \nevidence to the contrary. (Item 4.) \nApplicant went to Saudi Arabia from December 2013 to January 2014 to visit his \nfamily and for his engagement celebration to his now spouse. He used his Saudi passport, \nrenewed in July 2011 for another five years, to enter and exit Saudi Arabia. (Items 3-4.) \nHe was issued a personal identity card in Saudi Arabia to facilitate travel between Gulf \nCooperation Council countries without a Saudi passport. (Item 4.) \nDuring his last semester in college, Applicant had a part-time, unpaid internship in \nfinance with a real estate developer. (Item 3.) From July 2015 to December 2016, \nApplicant held full-time employment in the United States as a financial analyst with a \ndefense contractor. He applied for a DOD security clearance at that time, and was \ninterviewed on December 14, 2015, by an OPM investigator. He admitted that he holds \ndual citizenship and passports with the United States and Saudi Arabia, and that his \ncollege degree was paid for by a full scholarship valued at $200,000 from Saudi Arabia\u2019s \ngovernment. Applicant stated that he would be reluctant to surrender his passport or \nrenounce his citizenship with Saudi Arabia because he feels he would be disrespectful \nand because several of his family members and his fianc\u00e9e were living there at the time. \nApplicant explained that he was considered for a position by a company based in Saudi \nArabia (apparently in May 2015 per his SF 86), but he was not interested in working in \nSaudi Arabia. He expressed \u201cultimate allegiance\u201d to the United States as his moral \ncompass, ideals, and religion align with the United States. Applicant explained about his \ntravels in the Persian Gulf that he went to Bahrain about 15 to 20 times to go to the movies \nor to shop because it was only 30 to 40 minutes away from his home in Saudi Arabia; \ntraveled to Egypt to visit his father; went to the UAE to see his brother, who was living \nthere at the time; and went to Lebanon to visit his grandmother, who had an apartment \nthere at the time. He returned to Saudi Arabia only one time since coming to the United \nStates in December 2010, for 21 to 30 days from December 2013 to January 2014 for his \nengagement ceremony and to visit family members. (Item 4.) \nApplicant was contacted by telephone by an OPM investigator on December 16, \n2015, to clarify information regarding his relatives and foreign contacts. He provided the \nfull names of his siblings and detailed the extent of his contacts with his cousin, a dual \ncitizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia, with whom he was sharing an apartment. \nHe was re-contacted on December 17, 2015, for further clarification about his parents\u2019 \nnames. (Item 4.) There is no indication that he reported to the investigator any plans to \ntravel to Saudi Arabia. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant indicated on a June 2019 SF 86 that he married his spouse in Saudi \nArabia on December 25, 2015, but also his \u201cwedding ceremony\u201d was on March 18, 2017. \n(Item 3.) On February 11, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by a different OPM \ninvestigator. Regarding his \u201cfianc\u00e9e,\u201d Applicant related that she is a dual citizen of Saudi \nArabia and France, and that they met ten years ago in Saudi Arabia through a family \nfriend. He indicated that he had almost daily contact with her, by telephone or Internet \nchat. Because of their relationship, he also had contact with his \u201cfuture in-laws\u201d once \nevery two weeks by electronic chat. (Item 4.) There is no indication in the record that he \ntold the investigator about any December 2015 marriage in Saudi Arabia. \nApplicant met with the same OPM investigator on February 17, 2016, for further \ndetails about his foreign contacts. He indicated that his \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d was born in France and \nworks as a graphic designer in Saudi Arabia; that her father was born in Yemen and is \nemployed as chairman of a medical department in a hospital and also as an assistant \nprofessor for health sciences; and that her mother is a native of Lebanon and works as a \nFrench teacher in Saudi Arabia. Applicant also disclosed that he has monthly contact with \nhis grandmother, who is a homemaker in Saudi Arabia. He explained that none of these \nforeign nationals knew that he was under consideration for a sensitive position, and that \nthey were not affiliated with a foreign government or military organization. (Item 4.) As \nwith his interview a week prior, there is no indication that he mentioned a trip to Saudi \nArabia for his marriage in December 2015. \nApplicant left his job for a better-paying position as a help-desk technician with \nanother federal contractor in December 2016. He stayed in that position only through July \n2017. In August 2017, he began his current employment as a business analyst with a \ntechnology company that contracts with the DOD. (Item 3.) \nIn January 2018, Applicant traveled to the UAE for his oldest brother\u2019s wedding. In \nJuly 2018, Applicant took a \u201croad trip\u201d through three European countries with his spouse \nand her family. In December 2018, Applicant went to Saudi Arabia for over two weeks to \nvisit his spouse\u2019s family, his grandmother, and his older sister. On December 19, 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s personal identity card was renewed by Saudi Arabia for another five years. \n(Item 3.) \nApplicant completed an SF 86 on June 25, 2019. He indicated on his SF 86 that \nhe and his spouse married in Saudi Arabia in late December 2015, but also that he \ntraveled to Saudi Arabia in March 2017 for their \u201cwedding ceremony\u201d on March 18. He \nindicated that they were presently living together in the United States, and that she had a \n\u201cGreen Card\u201d under his sponsorship valid to March 19, 2028. Given U.S. Permanent \nResident cards are valid for ten years (see www.uscis.gov), she apparently obtained her \nGreen Card in March 2018. She came to the United States in April 2017. Applicant also \nindicated on his SF 86 that he has been cohabiting since September 1, 2016, with his \nmother, who immigrated to the United States under his sponsorship in June 2016, and \nhas a Permanent Resident Card that expires on August 18, 2028, and with his younger \nsister, who has an I-20 Form for student and exchange visitors and a visa valid to June \n24, 2021.

Applicant reported that he had contact every other day \nof late with his father in Egypt, who planned to release a feature film in October 2019. \nApplicant also disclosed that his older sister and two brothers, who hold dual citizenship \nwith the United States and Saudi Arabia, live in Saudi Arabia, where his sister owns a \n\u201cco-working space,\u201d and his oldest brother works for an American credit lender. He did \nnot report an employer for his other brother nor report the extent of his contacts with his \nsiblings in Saudi Arabia. Regarding his parents-in-law, who have dual citizenship with \nFrance and Saudi Arabia and live in Saudi Arabia, Applicant indicated he had weekly \ncontact with them, primarily through web chat. At least once a month, he called his \nspouse\u2019s parents through a mobile application. Applicant also listed that he had held a \nfull scholarship to attend college in the United States from Saudi Arabia, and that his \nyounger sister has been receiving a monthly stipend and health insurance from the Saudi \ngovernment to pay for her college in the United States since August 2018. The estimated \ntotal value of her scholarship is $150,000. Applicant disclosed the names of his former \nand his sister\u2019s current advisors from the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission. \nAs of Applicant\u2019s September 2019 Answer to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s older sister and \ntwo brothers were living in Saudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s sister still owned her own \u201cartistic co-\nworking space,\u201d his oldest brother was still working for the U.S.-based credit lender, and \nhis other brother was employed by a Saudi oil company. Although Applicant expressed \nthat he was thankful to Saudi Arabia for the full scholarship that paid for his college studies \nin the United States, he stated, \nI am thankful to the government of Saudi Arabia for that privilege [of \nattending university for free in the United States], but as an adult I have \nnever considered living in Saudi Arabia. I have chosen to live as a proud \nAmerican and will continue to live in the United States. (Item 2.) \nApplicant indicated that, over the past four years, he has established a respectable \ncareer in which he has developed great relationships and proven himself to be \ntrustworthy.

For additional background information \nregarding the two countries relationships with the U.S., I have reviewed the U.S. State \nDepartment\u2019s respective Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, issued for Saudi Arabia on \nNovember 26, 2019, and for Egypt on September 20, 2019. Of particular note are the \nfollowing salient facts. \nSaudi Arabia is ruled by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud as both head of state \nand head of government. Its 1992 Basic Law provides for the system of governance, \nrights of citizens, and the powers and duties of the government, including that the Quran \nand Sunna serve as the country\u2019s constitution, and that the male descendants of its \nfounder rule the country. \nWhile the country\u2019s most recent municipal elections in 2015 were held without any \nsignificant irregularities, and women were allowed to vote and run as candidates for the \nfirst time, government agents killed and dismembered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \nin the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in October 2018. King Salman pledged to hold \naccountable all those involved, but by late 2018, the Saudi government\u2019s Public \nProsecutor\u2019s Office had not named 11 indicted suspects. In spring 2019, the U.S. State \nDepartment publicly designated 16 officials of the Saudi government as ineligible for entry \nin the United States because of their roles in the murder of Khashoggi. On December 10, \n2019, the U.S. State Department designated Mohammed al Otaibi, former counsel \ngeneral of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, \nForeign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act 2019, as ineligible for entry \ninto the United States because of his involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s murder. The State \nDepartment urged the Saudi government to conduct a full, fair, and transparent trial of \nthose responsible and to hold those involved accountable. In December 2019, after a trial \nthat was closed to the public and lacked transparency, a Saudi court sentenced five to \ndeath in the killing but cleared the two most senior officials implicated, including al Otaibi. \nIn 2018, other significant human rights abuses included unlawful killings, including \nexecutions for nonviolent offenses; forced disappearances; torture of prisoners and \ndetainees by government agents; arbitrary arrest and detention, arbitrary interference \nwith privacy; restrictions on freedom of peaceable assembly, association, and movement; \nsevere restrictions on religious freedom; citizen\u2019s lack of freedom to choose their own \ngovernment; trafficking in persons; and violence and official discrimination against women \nand members of the LBGTQ community. Saudi law is based on the local interpretation of \nSharia law and is influenced by local customs and practices. U.S. citizens are subject to \nall local laws and authorities may expel, arrest, imprison, and even execute those violating \nthe law, even unknowingly. \nA Saudi-led coalition continued to conduct air strikes in Yemen that resulted in \ncivilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. The U.S. State Department\u2019s current \ntravel advisory for Saudi Arabia is Level 2 \u2013 exercise increased caution \u2013 due to terrorism \nand the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets. U.S. citizens are advised \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia have had full diplomatic relations since 1940. \nSaudi Arabia\u2019s significant oil reserves and its strategic location and role in the Arab and \nIslamic worlds have played a role in the longstanding bilateral relationship between the \ntwo countries. The United States and Saudi Arabia have a common interest in preserving \nthe stability, security, and prosperity of the Gulf region. The United States regards Saudi \nArabia as a strong partner in security and counterterrorism efforts and in military, \ndiplomatic, and financial cooperation. Saudi Arabia is the U.S.\u2019 largest customer of foreign \nmilitary sales, with more than $100 billion in active sales. Through its foreign military \nsales, the United States has supported Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, the National \nGuard, and Ministry of Interior. The U.S.-Saudi partnership is rooted in more than seven \ndecades of close friendship and cooperation, and the two countries enjoy a strong \neconomic relationship. They enjoy robust cultural and ties with some 55,000 Saudi \nstudents studying at universities or engaged in cultural exchanges in the United States \neach year. The United States, in cooperation with the Saudi government, provides \ntechnical support in areas such as education, trade, and economic development. Saudi \nArabia participates in some of the same international organizations as the United States, \nsuch as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade \nOrganization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto not travel within 50 miles of Yemen because of terrorism and armed conflict. The U.S. \nwarns that terrorist groups may attack with little or no warning, targeting both Saudi and \nWestern government interests, mosques and other religious sites, and places frequented \nby U.S. citizens and westerners. Missile attacks from rebel groups in Yemen have \ntargeted major cities, such as Riyadh and Jeddah; Riyadh\u2019s international airport; Saudi \nAramco facilities; and vessels in the Red Sea shipping lanes. The airport in Abha, in \nsoutheastern Saudi Arabia, has been under frequent attack, and U.S. mission personnel \nare not allowed to use the airport without Chief of Mission approval. \nEgypt is a constitutional republic governed by an elected president and unicameral \nlegislature. Challengers to Egypt\u2019s incumbent President al-Sisi withdrew before recent \npresidential elections in March 2019, some citing political pressure or unfair competition. \nSome challengers were arrested for alleged violations of candidacy prohibitions for \nmilitary personnel. Domestic and international organizations expressed concern that \ngovernment limitations on association, assembly, and expression severely constrained \nbroad participation in the political process. Egypt\u2019s parliament approved a state of \nemergency after an April 2017 terrorist attack on Coptic churches. Egypt was under a \ngovernment-declared state of emergency for all of 2018. Illegal demonstrations have \noccurred in Egypt which have turned volatile. The U.S. State Department\u2019s Office of \nDiplomatic Security\u2019s Egypt 2019 Crime & Safety Report: Cairo indicates that illegal \ndemonstrations have been quashed by Egyptian authorities in a relatively short time, but \nthat, because of the volatility of past demonstrations, peaceful demonstrators and even \nbystanders may be subject to questioning, detention, arrest, and conviction for \nparticipating in or proximity to unauthorized demonstrations.  \nIn 2018, Egypt\u2019s most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful \nkillings, including by government forces or its agents and non-state terrorist groups; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforced disappearances; torture, arbitrary arrest and detention; arbitrary or unlawful \ninterference with privacy; undue restrictions on free expression, the press, and the \nInternet; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of \nassociation; restrictions on political participation; and arbitrary arrest and targeting of \nLGBT persons and other minority groups. Government officials enjoyed a measure of \nimpunity for human rights abuses. \nIn 2017 and 2018, terrorist organizations, including some affiliates of the self-\nproclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group, carried out deadly attacks on government, \ncivilian, and security targets in Egypt, including on places of worship. While Egyptian \nauthorities investigated terrorist attacks and prosecuted alleged perpetrators, the U.S. \nState Department\u2019s current travel advisory for Egypt is Level 2 \u2013 exercise increased \ncaution \u2013 due to terrorism. U.S. citizens are advised against travel to the Sinai Peninsula \n(with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) or the Western Desert due to \nterrorism. The U.S. warns that terrorist groups may attack with little or no warning, \ntargeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets or shopping malls, and local \ngovernment facilities, and that there is a considerable risk of terrorist attacks in urban \nareas, including Cairo, despite a heavy security presence. On May 20, 2019, the U.S. \nState Department issued a security alert on reports of a roadside bomb attack on a tourist \nbus resulting in injuries in the area of the museum complex near the pyramids in Giza. \nCairo is reported to be at considerable risk of terrorism. \nThe U.S. seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Egypt. Promoting a \nstable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic rights of its citizens, \ncontinues to be a core objective of U.S. policy. Since 1980, the U.S. has provided Egypt \nwith over $40 billion in military assistance in furthering the strategic partnership and \nregional stability, and $30 billion in economic assistance. Two-way trade in goods \nbetween the U.S. and Egypt totaled $7.5 billion in 2018. American firms are active in most \nsectors of Egypt\u2019s economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial \nservices, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications, information technology, and \nthe restaurant and hospitality industry. Egypt and the U.S. belong to some of the same \ninternational organizations, such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, \nWorld Bank, and World Trade Organization. \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all \navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with national security. \nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel seeking a position of trust are afforded the \nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is \u201can examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables\u201d known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. \nThe person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for foreign influence are \narticulated in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant, his spouse, his parents, his siblings, and his parents-in-law all have \nSaudi Arabian citizenship. Applicant and three of his four siblings also have U.S. \ncitizenship because they were born in the United States, but Applicant spent his youth in \nEgypt and then Saudi Arabia. He attended high school in Saudi Arabia and obtained a \nscholarship from the Saudi government that fully paid for his college in the United States. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant chose to remain in the United States after he earned his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in May 2015, Applicant\u2019s three siblings with dual citizenship reside and work in \nSaudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s mother and his younger sister currently live with him and his \nspouse in the United States. His mother is a lawful permanent resident of the United \nStates and his sister is a university student on a scholarship funded by the Saudi \ngovernment. Applicant\u2019s father resides in Egypt, where he is a filmmaker. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and her parents have dual citizenship with France. While Applicant\u2019s spouse \nimmigrated to the United States under his sponsorship in approximately April 2017, and \nshe has U.S. permanent resident status, her parents currently reside in Saudi Arabia. \nThe Government alleges disqualifying foreign influence trustworthiness concerns \nbecause of the foreign citizenships of his close family members; the foreign residency of \nhis father, three of his siblings, and his parents-in-law; and Applicant\u2019s receipt of a \nscholarship totaling approximately $200,000 from the Saudi government based on his \nSaudi citizenship, which paid for his college studies in the United States from 2011 to \n2015. Applicant\u2019s possession of a valid Saudi passport and identity card were not alleged, \nand so they cannot be considered for disqualification purposes. In ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which \nconduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nApplicant\u2019s possession of a valid Saudi Arabian passport and a valid personal \nidentification card that facilitates travel in the Persian Gulf region, and his expressed \nreluctance to renounce his Saudi citizenship are relevant in assessing the relative \nstrength of his ties to Saudi Arabia and the United States in determining whether, in \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b), he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the \nUnited States, however. \nA person is not automatically disqualified from holding a sensitive position because \nhe has relatives with foreign citizenship or they live in a foreign country. However, if any \napplicant, his or her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a \nrelationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient \nto create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise \nof classified information. See ISCR Case No, 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009). \nContacts and connections to foreign citizens are potentially disqualifying if they present a \nheightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(e), or they create a potential conflict of interest \nunder AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying conditions provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion. \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family \nties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, \nits relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in \nassessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. Moreover, in considering the nature of the foreign government, the \nadministrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. \nSee generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). A heightened level \nof scrutiny is warranted when an applicant has a close relationship with relatives who \nreside in a country where elements hostile to the United States and its interests operate \nsomewhat freely. See generally ISCR Case No. 12-05092 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2017.) \nNeither Saudi Arabia nor Egypt are known to target the U.S. for sensitive \ninformation or to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. or its citizens. Both \nSaudi Arabia and Egypt have traditionally had close ties with the United States. The \nUnited States and Saudi Arabia have a common interest in preserving the stability, \nsecurity, and prosperity of the Gulf region. The United States regards Saudi Arabia as a \nstrong partner in security and counterterrorism efforts and in military, diplomatic, and \nfinancial cooperation. Promoting a stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government \nprotects the basic rights of its citizens, continues to be a core objective of U.S. policy. \nEven so, Guideline B trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the \nUnited States. Friendly nations can disagree with the United States over matters that they \nperceive as important to their national interest or security. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005). A heightened risk exists because of the closeness of Applicant\u2019s \nand his spouse\u2019s family ties to Saudi Arabia, and Applicant\u2019s ties to his father in Egypt. \nApplicant clearly has close ties to his spouse and mother. He sponsored both of them for \nimmigration to the United States and lives with them. He did not disclose the frequency \nof his contacts with his siblings in Saudi Arabia on his June 2019 SF 86, but there is \nevidence of bonds of affection. He attended the wedding of his oldest brother in the UAE \nin January 2018. In December 2018, Applicant went to Saudi Arabia for over two weeks \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto visit his spouse\u2019s family, his grandmother, and his older sister. As of June 2019, \nApplicant was in contact with his father in Egypt almost daily and with his parents-in-law \nin Saudi Arabia weekly, primarily through web chat. At least once a month, he called his \nspouse\u2019s parents through a mobile application. He and his spouse traveled in Europe with \nher parents in July 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is chairman of a medical department in a Saudi hospital \nand an assistant professor. While neither position has military, security, or intelligence \nimplications, it is more rather than less likely that his father-in-law would be known to \nSaudi authorities. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s work as a filmmaker could raise the \nattention of Egyptian authorities. Even so, the issue under Guideline B is not whether an \napplicant\u2019s immediate family members in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign \ngovernment or entity based on their prominence or personal situation. The issue is \nwhether an applicant\u2019s foreign ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a \nforeign power or terrorists could seek to exploit in an effort to obtain unauthorized access \nto classified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 03-24933 (App. Bd. July 28, \n2005). It is conceivable that undue influence or pressure could be brought to bear on \nApplicant through his understandably close ties to his immediate family and to his \nspouse\u2019s family. Furthermore, there exists an indirect risk of undue foreign influence \nbecause of his spouse\u2019s ties to her parents, and to his mother\u2019s and younger sister\u2019s ties \nto his father and other siblings living in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(e) apply. \nRegarding the possible risks of undue foreign influence because of Applicant\u2019s \nsizeable scholarship from the Saudi government, without any evidence that he has any \nobligations to the Saudi government because of that scholarship, the security concerns \nset forth in AG \u00b6 7(f) are not presently implicated. AG \u00b6 7(f) provides: \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or potential \nconflict of interest. \nApplicant has a significant burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he cannot be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and a desire to assist his or his spouse\u2019s \nimmediate family members. AG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply because the foreign persons involved are immediate \nfamily with whom Applicant or his spouse or both has close bonds of affection if not also \nobligation; there is a significant threat of terrorist activity in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nincluding in urban areas; and there are ongoing human rights problems in both countries. \nThe risk of any of his family members being kidnapped may be remote, but government \nofficials in Saudi Arabia have shown that they are willing to detain individuals and even \ncommit murder to silence critics of the monarchy or its conservative policies. Egypt has \nbeen under a renewed state of emergency since 2017 because of terrorist attacks. Illegal \ndemonstrations in Egypt have turned volatile, and even bystanders may be subject to \nquestioning, \ndetention, \narrest \nand \nconviction \nfor \nproximity \nto \nunauthorized \ndemonstrations. Applicant last visited his family in Saudi Arabia in 2018, but his mother \nwent to Saudi Arabia to visit family members in June 2019. Applicant has not expressed \nan intent to avoid future travel to Saudi Arabia or Egypt. There is no indication that he or \nhis family members have ever been targeted, but the possibility cannot be ruled out. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(b), during his December 14, 2015 OPM interview Applicant \nexpressed \u201cultimate allegiance\u201d to the United States, stating that his moral compass, \nideals, and religion align with the United States. Yet it is difficult to conclude that the bonds \nof affection and obligation to his immediate family, including his spouse and her parents, \nare similarly so minimal to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nRegarding whether Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of \nthe U.S. interest, his U.S. citizenship was obtained by birth here, but he spent his youth \nin Egypt and Saudi Arabia. His family was apparently living in Egypt when his younger \nsister was born in January 1998. He moved to Saudi Arabia in July 2006 and attended \nschool there until he came to the United States in December 2010. While in college in the \nUnited States from August 2011 to May 2015, he received a monthly stipend from the \nSaudi government and health insurance. He qualified for his scholarship covering his \ncollege and living expenses from the Saudi government based on his Saudi citizenship. \nHis ties to the United States have strengthened since he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in \nMay 2015. Applicant chose to pursue his life and career in the United States. He is \ncredited under AG \u00b6 8(b) with sponsoring his spouse and mother for U.S. permanent \nresidency, and their U.S. lawful residency somewhat mitigates the risk of undue foreign \ninfluence presented by their Saudi citizenship. Even so, he has maintained his Saudi \ncitizenship, and his Saudi passport and identity card. His identity card was renewed in \nDecember 2018, years after he had been interviewed by OPM investigators about his \nforeign connections. As a dual citizen, he is legally entitled to accept benefits or privileges \noffered by Saudi Arabia, but it undercuts his case with respect to establishing that his ties \nto the United States are so deep and longstanding that he can be counted on to resolve \nany conflict in favor of the United States. Applicant presented no evidence from others \nattesting to his commitment to his work, his involvement in his local community, or other \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naspects of behavior that could weigh in his favor with respect to demonstrating that he \ncould not be manipulated or induced to aid a foreign family member. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) also does not apply. It cannot reasonably be said that his \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d), which are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nFurthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s rationale extends to trustworthiness cases as well, given the \nsame standard and guidelines apply. Applicant has no control over his older siblings\u2019 and \nparents-in-law\u2019s decisions to pursue their lives in Saudi Arabia or of his father\u2019s decision \nto pursue his career as a filmmaker in Egypt. He told an OPM investigator that his \n\u201cultimate loyalty\u201d is with the United States. He indicated in response to the SOR that he \nhas chosen to live as \u201ca proud American\u201d and that he intends to live in the United States. \nWhile there is nothing untoward about his relationships and contacts with family members \nwith foreign citizenship or foreign citizenship and residency, his present circumstances \nare such that he could be placed in an untenable position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a loved one and the U.S. As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \n \n \nCase No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a \ncomment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may \nact in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-\none, such as a family member.\u201d Based on the facts and circumstances before me, \nconcerns of undue foreign influence persist. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Donna Price, Esq. \n03/20/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant has refuted the allegation that he \ndeliberately falsified his security clearance application (SCA), and he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an SCA on May 17, 2018. On July 26, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 3, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 2, \n2020, and the case was assigned to me on January 9, 2020. On February 7, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for February 27, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \npresented the testimony of four witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 6, 2020. \n \n \nOn March 11, 2020, I reopened the record for clarification of Applicant\u2019s \nperformance evaluations in AX 4.a and 4.f. Applicant submitted AX 4.g and 4.h and an \nexplanation of the new exhibits, which I marked as AX 4.i. The three new exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. The record closed on March 16, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g \nand denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old program manager and cost analyst employed by a \ndefense contractor since September 2014. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1999. \nHe was employed by defense contractors from June 2000 to December 2011, and he \nwas a civilian employee of the Navy from December 2014 to August 2014. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2001. (Tr. 77.) \n \n \nApplicant married in September 2007, separated in February 2013, and divorced \nin August 2017. His marriage began to deteriorate in 2012, and he and his then wife \nbegan marriage counseling in 2013. They separated when Applicant\u2019s wife moved out of \nthe marital home without notice, taking their two children with her. His wife left him a letter \nnotifying him to call her lawyer if he wanted to see their children. (Tr. 80.)  \n \nApplicant has lived with a cohabitant since March 2014. He has two children from \nhis previous marriage, ages 11 and 7. He and his cohabitant have two children, ages 4 \nand 3.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant and his wife separated, all the family debts were current. However, \nthe divorce was contentious, drawn-out, and expensive. In August 2015, Applicant \ncontacted an attorney regarding a divorce and possible bankruptcy filing. He testified that \nhis financial situation had fallen apart, he was \u201ctreading water,\u201d and he needed help. When \nhe contacted the attorney, his net monthly income was $6,899, his expenses were \n$6,595, and his debt payments were $1,654, leaving a monthly shortfall of $1,350. (AX \n3.d.2.) The lawyer advised Applicant to file a joint bankruptcy before the divorce to save \nlegal fees and avoid having to litigate responsibility for marital debt. He also advised \nApplicant that, if he intended to file a bankruptcy petition, he should stop paying \n\n \n3 \n \nunsecured creditors whose debts were likely to be discharged. (AX 1.) At the time, \nApplicant and the lawyer believed that the divorce hearing was imminent. Applicant \nnotified his security officer that he was considering bankruptcy. (Tr. 93-94.)  \n \nIn October 2015, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife filed a petition for bankruptcy. She obtained \na bankruptcy discharge, leaving him solely responsible for what had been joint marital \ndebts. (Tr. 89-90.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce was not granted until August 2017. By then, he had incurred \nabout $34,000 in legal fees. He also was required to pay his wife\u2019s legal fees, child \nsupport, and allocation of marital debt totaling about $39,085.  \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in May 2018, he and his cohabitant had pooled \ntheir assets and had net monthly income of $11,981, expenses of $5,811, debt payments \nof $5,064, and a net remainder of about $1,107. (AX 3.e.2.) At the time of the hearing, he \nand his cohabitant had net monthly income of $11,524, expenses of $6,177, debt \npayments of $10,212, and a net remainder of about $1,311. (AX 3.f.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he had total indebtedness of about $94,696. \nBefore the SOR was issued, he paid off several debts not alleged in the SOR, including \na $19,000 student loan. (AX 3.a at 6.) As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had paid \nhis lawyers in full; he had reduced his financial obligation to his ex-wife from $39,085 to \n$20,688; and his total indebtedness had been reduced to $72,184. (Tr. 88-89; AX 3.h.) \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $37,082. The evidence \nconcerning these debts is summarized below. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: unsecured personal loan charged off for $17,065. This debt \noriginated as a car loan obtained by Applicant and his ex-wife in February 2012. They \napplied to another lender for refinancing of the loan to obtain a lower interest rate, and \ntheir application was approved in January 2013. (AX 2.a.1.) However, after they \nseparated in February 2013, Applicant\u2019s then wife had possession of the car and refused \nto sign the car title. Thus, the refinancing was never completed, and they fell behind on \nthe payments. In May 2013, Applicant obtained an unsecured personal loan from the \noriginal creditor, at a significantly higher interest rate, to pay off the original secured car \nloan. (Tr. 107-110.) Applicant\u2019s last payment on the unsecured loan was in August 2015, \nwhen he was considering bankruptcy. He did not consider continuing the payments \nbecause the bankruptcy attorney advised him that this creditor was not likely to pursue \nhim. (Tr. 111.) The debt was charged off in March 2016. In October 2019, the creditor \noffered to settle it for $5,119. (AX 2.a.3.) In January 2020, the creditor again offered to \nsettle the debt, this time for $5,973. (AX 2.a.4.) The debt is not settled. Applicant testified \nthat he intends to pay this debt, even though his attorney has told him that collection is \nbarred by the statute of limitations. (Tr. 99-100.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $12,513. This credit card was \nissued by the same creditor as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and it was jointly held by Applicant \n\n \n4 \n \nand his ex-wife. His ex-wife\u2019s obligation was extinguished by her bankruptcy discharge. \nApplicant\u2019s last payment on this debt was in September 2015, and it was charged off in \nNovember 2015. (AX 3.a at 1.) In January 2020, the creditor offered to settle the account \nfor $4,379, but Applicant has not accepted the offer or made any payments on this debt. \n(Tr. 101.)  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s conversations with the bankruptcy lawyer, he believed that \nthe creditor would not pursue him for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He also \nknew that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were not accruing interest, and so he \nconcentrated on paying other high-interest debts first. (Tr. 117.) At the hearing, he \nadmitted that he had been receiving letters from this creditor about twice a year, but he \ndid not identify which of the three debts to this creditor were the subject of those letters. \nHe testified that he had not received any letters from this creditor for a couple of months, \nand his indebtedness to this creditor \u201cjust wasn\u2019t on [his] mind\u201d when he submitted his \nSCA. (Tr. 115.) He testified that he had put these debts on the \u201cback burner\u201d until he could \nrevisit them when he was financially able to resolve them. He estimated that it would be \ntwo and half years before he will have paid off his court-ordered obligations to his ex-wife \nand will be able to address the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 116-18.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off and reduced to judgment for \n$6,084. This debt was charged off in July 2014. (GX 2 at 2.) The collection agency filed \nsuit in October 2015. In November 2015, Applicant notified the collection agency that he \nwas unable to repay the debt. (AX 2.c.1.) The collection agency obtained a judgment in \nApril 2016. (GX 4.) Applicant testified that initially the creditor wanted the entire amount \npaid in full and there was no negotiation about a payment plan. He also testified that the \ncollection attorneys made no efforts to collect the debt by garnishment or other means. \n(Tr. 120.) However, in September 2019, Applicant began repaying this debt under a \npayment plan providing for monthly $260 payments. He has paid about $1,560 on this \ndebt. His payments were current through January 2020. (Tr. 101; AX 2.c.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: utility bill placed for collection of $165. This debt was for utilities for \na townhouse jointly owned by Applicant and his ex-wife. They purchased the property \nbefore they were married and kept it as a rental property when Applicant began working \nfor a defense contractor in another state. The tenants did not timely pay the rent, and \nApplicant could not afford the payments on the mortgage loan. The loan on the property \nwas foreclosed in May 2014 and the property was sold. There was no deficiency after the \nforeclosure sale, and the defaulted mortgage on the rental property is not alleged in the \nSOR. The utility bill is listed in the April 2019 credit report as disputed but does not reflect \nthe date or the basis for the dispute. (GX 2 at 2.) Applicant paid it in August 2019. (AX \n2.d.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f: delinquent medical bills for $148 and $58. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that the divorce court ordered his ex-wife to pay these \ndebts. After she received a bankruptcy discharge, Applicant paid one bill in August 2019 \nand the other in November 2019. (AX 2.e; AX 2.f.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR 1.g: line of credit referred for collection of $1,049. The creditor for this \ndebt is the same creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. It was charged off in June 2018. \n(GX 3 at 11.) In December 2018, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt for less \nthan the full amount. He accepted the offer and paid the agreed amount in August 2019. \n(AX 2.g.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant has been employed by a defense contractor for about five \nyears and recently received a top secret clearance. (Tr. 52-53.) She met Applicant \nthrough an online dating service in November 2013, about nine months after Applicant \nand his wife separated. She testified that they intend to marry but have not yet done so \nbecause she does not want her financial assets to be vulnerable to legal actions by his \nex-wife. (Tr. 55-56.) They kept their finances separate until the divorce was final. They \nhave now merged their incomes with the goal of resolving all of their debts. (Tr. 68-70.)  \n \nApplicant and his cohabitant share the same financial vision and have embraced \nthe Dave Ramsey methodology for resolving their debts. They first tackled their current \ndebts and then moved on to older debts. They paid off several medical bills, the loans on \ntwo cars, Applicant\u2019s student loans, and Applicant\u2019s legal bills. They next began working \non credit-card accounts, paying off some and consolidating others. (Tr. 67-68; AX 5.l) \nStarting in 2013, Applicant has used budget spreadsheets to prioritize the resolution of \nhis debts.  \n \n \nApplicant is generally familiar with the security-clearance process. His most recent \nSCA was his third. When he submitted it, he did not disclose any of the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g. However, he disclosed the foreclosure of the loan on the jointly-owned \ntownhouse in May 2014, a $200 fine for contempt of court in May 2014 when he violated \nthe terms of a child-custody order, a court order requiring him to repay his ex-wife $35,000 \nfrom a retirement account, and a court order requiring payment of child support.  \n \nApplicant testified that he was confronted with the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a by a security \ninvestigator at some time after he submitted his SCA. The record does not reflect when \nthe interview occurred and does not include a written summary of the interview. Applicant \ntestified that he was more concerned with the fact that he omitted it in his SCA rather than \nthe fact that it was delinquent. (Tr. 114.) He also testified that it was a \u201cred flag\u201d when the \nsecurity investigator also questioned him about the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, because \nhe had not disclosed it in his SCA. (Tr. 121.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he relied on his budgeting worksheets to answer the \nfinancial questions in the SCA. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g were not on \nhis budgeting worksheets because he did not intend to pay them in the near future. His \nworksheets were used to allocate income toward the high-priority debts he was trying to \nresolve. (Tr. 122-23.) His personal financial statement dated May 17, 2018 (two days \nbefore the date of his SCA) listed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g as \ncharged off, with no payments scheduled. (AX 3.e.2.) He had been advised by the \nbankruptcy attorney that collection of these debts was barred by the statute of limitations. \nHis \u201cdebt reduction calculator,\u201d a worksheet dated August 15, 2018, listed ten debts to be \n\n \n6 \n \npaid in order of priority. It did not list the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g. \n(AX 3.e(3).) \n \n \nThe delinquent utility bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was left over from the foreclosure \non the rental property in May 2015, and it was not included in Applicant\u2019s worksheet \nprioritizing the debts to be paid. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife had been ordered by the divorce court \nto pay the two medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. The medical debts were not \non Applicant\u2019s priority list, and Applicant reasonably could have thought that he was not \nrequired to disclose them because they were his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. It is not clear \nwhy he did not disclose the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, except that it was the same creditor \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, his bankruptcy lawyer assured him that this creditor \nwould not pursue these debts, and it was not included in the prioritized list of debts in his \nbudget worksheets. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2015 through 2018 reflect his growth as a \nproject manager, with strong managerial and leadership skills. (AX 4.a-AX 4.i.) His \nevaluation for 2017 rates his performance as \u201cexceptional\u201d and comments on his \nexpertise and ability to manage and prioritize smartly. His evaluation for 2018 states that \nhe \u201cconsistently demonstrates exceptionally sound judgment and the ability to effectively \nprioritize and balance many competing efforts.\u201d It notes that he \u201ctakes care of his people \nand is a respected team player.\u201d \n \n \nThe co-founder and current majority owner of the defense contractor for which \nApplicant works is a retired Navy captain. He testified that he is Applicant\u2019s direct \nsupervisor and interacts with him several times a week. He considers Applicant one of \nthe most important program managers in the company. He has found him to be a \ntrustworthy, reliable and responsible employee. Applicant approached him about \n\u201cnegative feedback\u201d on his SCA and told him about the allegations in the SOR. He \nconsiders Applicant a \u201cvery highly reliable and trustworthy servant of the federal \ngovernment.\u201d (Tr. 24-29.) \n \n \nThe vice-president and co-owner of Applicant\u2019s employer, also a retired Navy \ncaptain, submitted a statement supporting Applicant\u2019s application for a clearance and \nexpressing his high regard for Applicant\u2019s character, performance, and integrity. (AX 5.a.) \nHe also testified at the hearing. He considers Applicant a \u201cstellar contractor\u201d whose \nreputation is \u201cimpeccable.\u201d (Tr. 35-40.)  \n \n \nThe Navy contracting officer representative for the program that Applicant \nmanages testified and submitted a written statement. (AX 5.j.) For the past five years, he \nhas interacted with Applicant almost every day. He believes that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were caused mostly by his divorce. He believes that Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose his delinquent debts in his SCA was due to his erroneous reliance on \nspreadsheets that did not list all his delinquent debts. He considers Applicant very \ntrustworthy and believes that his opinion is shared by others involved in Applicant\u2019s \nprogram. (Tr. 42-49.) \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOne of the four owners of the company employing Applicant has known him since \n2014 and regards him as one of the company\u2019s most valuable managers. She has \nobserved his skill in managing multi-million-dollar contracts. She considers him a great \nleader and mentor. She is aware of the allegations in the SOR and strongly recommends \nthat his security clearance be continued. (AX 5.b.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, younger sister, and several former colleagues and long-time \nfriends submitted letters on his behalf. They uniformly admire Applicant for his honesty, \nintegrity, reliability, compassion, technical skills, and devotion to his children. They find \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing his debts in his SCA plausible and consistent \nwith the way he organizes problems with spreadsheets. (AX 5.b-5.k.) Applicant\u2019s \ncohabitant submitted a statement describing the contentious nature of the divorce \nproceedings and expressing her admiration for Applicant\u2019s consistency, strength, and \nintegrity. (AX 5.l.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, numerous, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s divorce and his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy \ndischarge of marital joint debts were conditions largely beyond his control. He acted \nresponsibly by obtaining legal advice about bankruptcy and divorce, maintaining contact \nwith his creditors, and resolving several debts not alleged in the SOR, including a \nsubstantial student loan. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are unresolved and \nApplicant has no plan to resolve them in the near future. However, he intends to resolve \nthem when he is financially able to do so. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that \nan individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts \nalleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or \nshe need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n\n \n10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s system of spreadsheets demonstrates a well-conceived, methodical plan to \nresolve all his debts, and he has taken significant steps to implement it. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant obtained legal advice and has incorporated \nthat advice in his long-range plan to regain financial stability. His continued contact with \nthe creditor for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g and his resolution of the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g are \u201cclear indications\u201d that his problems are being \nresolved. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. It is \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g, which have been resolved \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although the April 2019 credit report reflects that the \nutility bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is disputed, it does not reflect the basis of the dispute, and \nany dispute has been mooted by full payment of the amount claimed. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under this guideline is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nApplicant was not a neophyte when he submitted his May 2018 SCA, having done \nso twice before. He meticulously disclosed several derogatory facts, including a mortgage \nforeclosure and being fined for contempt of court. He knew immediately that there was a \n\n \n11 \n \n\u201cred flag\u201d when a security investigator asked him about a debt that he had not disclosed \nin his SCA, and he was more concerned with the omission than the fact that the debt was \ndelinquent. As a cost analyst, he lives in a world of financial spreadsheets, and he used \nthat methodology to gain control of his financial situation. He was negligent when he \nprepared his SCA, but negligence falls short of deliberate falsification. He was not trying \nto conceal his financial problems. To the contrary, he notified his security officer in August \n2015 that he had financial problems and was considering bankruptcy. I found his \nexplanation for not disclosing the debts in his SCA plausible and credible. I conclude that \nApplicant has refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, and the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not established. No other disqualifying conditions under Guideline E are \nestablished. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the \nhearing. He has worked for defense contractors and as a civilian employee of the Navy \nfor almost 20 years. He has held a security clearance since 2001, apparently without \nincident. In spite of the emotional stress of a bitterly contested divorce, he has performed \nwell in his job and has earned the respect of colleagues and supervisors, several whom \nare retired senior officers in the U.S. Navy. His supervisors have reviewed the SOR and \nwere unwavering in their support for Applicant at the hearing. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the \nallegation that he deliberately falsified his SCA, and he has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/01/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns involving \nhis failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, pay federal income taxes, \nand his delinquent consumer debt. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 18, 2019 (Answer), and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government \nsubmitted its written case on March 4, 2020. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the Government\u2019s FORM on March 11, 2020. He did not respond to \nthe Government\u2019s FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2020. The \nGovernment\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 49 years old. \nAs of his 2017 security clearance application (SCA), he was unmarried, he did not have \nany children, and he has resided with his parents since July 2017. (Items 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant attended college in 2008 but did not earn a degree. He was \nunemployed from September 2011 to May 2012. As of his 2017 SCA, he worked as a \nquality assurance inspector for a DOD contractor since July 2016. He has never held a \nDOD security clearance. (Items 3, 4) \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2012 and 2015 through 2017 and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j). It alleges that he failed to timely pay his federal income \ntaxes for tax years 2012 and 2015 through 2018 and he owed the U.S. Government \napproximately $6,963 in unpaid federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l). It also alleges \nthat he has eight delinquent consumer debts, totaling $63,389 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h).  \n \n \nIn addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant listed his failure to file his \n2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns and pay his taxes for those years on his 2017 \nSCA. He further discussed his financial issues during his December 2018 and January \n2019 interviews with a background investigator, as well as in his August 2019 response \nto interrogatories. His consumer debts are reported on his 2017 and 2019 credit bureau \nreports. (Items 1-6) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial predicament to caring for his ailing elderly \nparents. He stated that when he began providing daily in-home care for his father in \n2009, he consequently had little time to collect his tax documents or find a tax \naccountant. In 2011, he became unemployed after exhausting his vacation and \npersonal leave due to caring for his parents. In 2016, his finances further suffered when \nhe provided financial assistance to his parents when they could not meet their \nobligations. He obtained an auto loan to lease a car in 2015 and permitted his domestic \npartner to use the car and make the payments on the loan, and then did not make the \npayments himself when his domestic partner could not afford to do so in June 2017. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a)  (Items 3, 4) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) tax account transcripts from August 2019 reflect \nthat Applicant did not file a federal income tax return for tax year 2018, and he failed to \ntimely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2017. He filed his \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2017 as follows: for tax year \n2012, he filed in July 2013, and then he filed an amended return in July 2018; for tax \nyears 2013, 2016, and 2017, he filed in August 2018; for tax year 2014, he filed in July \n2015; and for tax year 2015, he filed in September 2018. The transcripts also reflect that \nApplicant owed a total of $5,606 in federal taxes for tax years 2012 and 2015 to 2017, \nand he did not owe federal taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant stated during his background interviews that his May 2018 request to \nthe IRS for a payment plan of $250 monthly was denied in approximately October 2018. \nHe further stated that he resubmitted another request in November 2018, for a payment \nplan of $1,000 monthly, and he was still awaiting a response as of his December 2018 \nbackground interview. He provided documentation reflecting that he submitted a request \nto the IRS for an installment agreement of $250 monthly in August 2019. He also stated \nin his August 2019 response to interrogatories that he had not yet filed his state income \ntax returns for tax years 2012 and 2015 through 2018. Though he stated that he had \nfiled his state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014, he was uncertain about \nthe date in which he filed them and the amount he owed. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant also discussed during his background interviews the repossession of \nhis leased car (SOR \u00b6 1.a), as discussed above, and his seven delinquent credit cards \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.h). He stated that he retained a debt consolidation service in August \n2017 in an effort to resolve his delinquent consumer debt. He stated that he paid the \nservice $800 monthly until approximately April 2018, when he terminated the service \nafter discovering that the company was only paying one of his consumer accounts. He \nstated that he intended to contact his employer\u2019s financial program in January 2019 for \nhelp with resolving his delinquent debts. (Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 and \n2015 through 2017, and his state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018, \nas required. He also failed to pay $5,606 in federal taxes for tax years 2012 and 2015 to \n2017. He was also unable to pay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply.  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not demonstrated that he \nis resolving his outstanding federal taxes or that he has filed his state income tax \n\n \n6 \n \n \nreturns for tax years 2012 through 2018. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017). In \naddition, since terminating the services of the debt consolidation company in April 2018, \nhe has not demonstrated that he has taken any further steps toward resolving his \nsignificant delinquent consumer debt. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) are not established.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November \n21, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on November 21, 2019, scheduling the hearing for December 17, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n4, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nwas left open until January 17, 2020, for receipt of additional documentation. On \n\n \n2 \n \nJanuary 12, 2020, Applicant submitted a one paragraph closing argument, but no \nevidentiary documentation.

He has submitted nothing \nshowing any action vis-\u00e0-vis this admitted past-due debt. This allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \n \n1.e.

This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has three outstanding car loans, and two other past-due debts The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. He has defaulted on three car loans; and has done nothing to resolve \nthem, nor has he made any good-faith effort to even begin to repay them. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on August 14, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Appended to his Answer is documentation \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which I consider to be a part of his \n\n \n2 \n \nAnswer. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) on September 30, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for October 29, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. (Tr. \nat 13-17) \n \nApplicant objected to Government Exhibit (GE) 1, consisting of his November 2018 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), on the basis that it is irrelevant and immaterial. I \noverruled Applicant\u2019s objection and admitted GE 1 in evidence. Applicant testified, called \nthree witnesses, and submitted AE I through L, which I admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The record closed at the conclusion of the hearing. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 12, 2019. (Tr. at 10-17, 129) \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the sole allegation in his Answer. He is 46 years old, married, \nand does not have any children. (Answer; Tr. at 18, 84-94; GE 1) \n \n \n Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996 and a doctorate degree in 2010. As \nof the date of the hearing, he worked as a lead scientist for his employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since September 2018. He has never held a security clearance. (Answer; Tr. \nat 18-26, 60, 105, 108-109; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from approximately 1991 to March 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nHe purchased marijuana for personal use from friends and his brother between 1991 and \n2012. After marijuana was legalized in his home state in 2012, he purchased ingestible \nmarijuana from state dispensaries between 2014 and 2018. He disclosed his use and \npurchase of marijuana on his 2018 SCA. He has always known that marijuana use is \nillegal. He first used marijuana during his first year of college in 1991. He used it \nrecreationally and approximately once a week throughout college. His marijuana use was \nprimarily with college friends, but he acknowledged that he used it alone on occasion. \n(Answer; Tr. at 26-84; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after graduating from college while working \nin the private sector. He underwent and passed pre-employment drug testing with various \nemployers, but he was not subsequently subject to drug testing. He was unaware that \nany of his employers prohibited illegal drug use. He did not use marijuana at work or \nreport to work under the influence of marijuana. He used it recreationally and \napproximately twice monthly from around 1996 to 2000. He then used it approximately \nonce every three weeks from around 2000 to 2003, and then once monthly from around \n2003 to February 2018. He used marijuana to relax, primarily when he was alone at home \nand during the weekends. He stated that it was \u201cmy equivalent of having a glass of wine \nafter a long day or a long couple of weeks.\u201d He used marijuana with his brother, his wife\u2019s \ncousin, and friends; and he used marijuana with his spouse once, in around 2002. His \nmarijuana use did not adversely affect his job performance and he was favorable rated \nby his employers during this period. (Answer; Tr. at 26-94; GE 1) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant abstained from marijuana use four times: (1) in 2006 for three months; \n(2) from 2008 to 2009; (3) from 2010 to early 2012; and (4) from 2014 to 2015. The first \ntwo periods of abstention occurred during two major examinations for his doctoral \nprogram; the third occurred during the year that he worked overseas, where the \nconsequences of illegal drug use were severe, and for five months after his return to the \nUnited States; and the fourth occurred because he had no need to use it. (Answer; Tr. at \n26-94; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant decided to permanently stop using marijuana in March 2018. The \nimpetus for his decision was his recruitment by his current employer. He testified: \n \n[My employer] described the position to me and we had a very frank and \nopen discussion about my marijuana use and my history. The exact \nconversation we\u2019ve had here, I had with [my employer]. And [my employer] \nmade it very clear to me that marijuana use was strictly prohibited and was \nnot conducive with the position that I was looking at taking. And I \nimmediately stopped. I realized that this position was the -- so at first, I \nhadn\u2019t really looked very closely at positions in government, advising the \ngovernment on tactical matters. That was not a job that I had really looked \nat closely. I was approached by [my employer]. We had this frank \ndiscussion. I went out through my network and spoke with other people that \nhad similar positions, and I became very attracted to the idea of coming out \nhere. So I immediately stopped my marijuana use and signed an agreement \nwith [my employer] . . . . \n \n(Answer; Tr. at 48-50, 71-72, 108-122; AE I, J, K, L) \n \n \nApplicant testified that it was not difficult for him to decide to never again use \nmarijuana, and he would leave if he were to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs \nwere being used. He adopted a new and active lifestyle in 2018. An August 2019 \nevaluation by a licensed clinical social worker determined that Applicant did not have a \nsubstance use disorder. He also signed a letter of intent to not use illegal drugs or misuse \nlegal drugs in the future in August 2019. He declared such an intention despite his \nemployer\u2019s lack of a drug testing program. His spouse was aware of and supported his \ncommitment to abstain from marijuana use. He disassociated from most of the individuals \nwith whom he previously used marijuana, except for his brother, his wife\u2019s cousin, and his \ntwo friends. He notified these four individuals in March 2018 about his decision to abstain \nfrom marijuana and his intent to disassociate from anyone who used it in his presence, \nand they were supportive of his decision. (Answer; Tr. at 18-94; AE I, J, K, L) \n \n \nThe two founding partners of the company for whom Applicant worked testified. \nBoth were aware of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use and were confident in his decision to \nabstain from such use. They described Applicant as an outstanding employee and a \ntrustworthy, honest, and reliable individual. Several former co-workers who were aware \nof Applicant\u2019s marijuana use also attested to Applicant\u2019s reliability, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness. His performance for the period of September to December 2018 was \n\n \n4 \n \nrated favorably by his employer. His previous employer also rated him favorably for the \nyears in which he worked there, from 2011 to 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 94-122; AE I, J, K, L) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; and  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1991 to 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \nestablished. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n\n \n6 \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \nApplicant has taken responsibility for his lengthy past drug use. He was \nforthcoming in his SCA and at the hearing. He credibly stated that he has no intention to \nuse illegal drugs in the future. He disassociated himself from most of the individuals with \nwhom he previously used illegal drugs, and he notified the four individuals with whom he \ncontinued to socialize of his intent to abstain from illegal drug use. He provided a signed \nstatement of intent in 2019. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are \nestablished. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant was credible and candid at his \nhearing. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns involving drug involvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:    \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n02/20/2020 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, but failed to mitigate the Guideline E, personal conduct security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 25, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 14, 2020. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and offered Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was \nheld open until January 28, 2020, to permit Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He \ntimely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) B through E. There were no objections to any \nexhibits offered, and all were admitted into evidence. (Hearing Exhibit I) DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on January 23, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He admitted the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He is not married \nand has no children. After college he was employed until August 2018, when he was laid \noff. He was unemployed until December 2018. He received unemployment benefits. He \nbegan working for his current employer, a federal contractor, in January 2019. (Tr. 15-19) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his voluntary participation in a real \nestate seminar conducted by a former reality television star and real estate investor, \nPerson A. His participation began in 2017. He attended the seminar conducted by Person \nA, for which he paid $15,000 to learn how to buy and sell houses, make real estate \ninvestments, and within 90 days make a profit. Applicant used credit cards to finance his \nattendance at the seminar. He believed that he would earn enough money from his real \nestate investments to pay the credit cards. Person A has been sued several times by \nformer students, who alleged they received worthless advice through the seminars; they \nwere victims of predatory and fraudulent business practices; and the seminars are \ndesigned to deceive and coerce customers into purchasing additional products. The \nlawsuits have been dismissed for various jurisdictional issues. It is unknown if there is a \ncurrent, pending lawsuit. Applicant believes the real estate seminar was a scam. (Tr. 19-\n23) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in January 2019. In \nresponse to Section 26 that inquired whether Applicant had any bills or debts, including \ncredit cards that were turned over to a collection agency, charged off or canceled for \nfailing to pay, he responded \u201cno.\u201d (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed in February 2019 by a government investigator. During \nthe interview, he was asked by the investigator to describe his overall financial situation. \nApplicant responded it was good, and he was meeting all of his obligations on time. He \nwas then confronted with the delinquent debts detailed in his credit report and that are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. He told the investigator he did not disclose the debts \nbecause he was not sure he needed to list them because he was scammed into investing \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nin a real estate deal and used his credit cards to finance his investment. He had not taken \nany action to resolve the delinquent credit cards before he was interviewed, but told the \ninvestigator he would inquire about a payment plan to resolve them. The debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c are corroborated by a January 2019 credit bureau report. The \ndebts became delinquent in 2018. (GE 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not disclose his delinquent debts on his SCA or when \nhe was asked to describe his finances by the government investigator because he was \nembarrassed that he had been scammed. He stated that his embarrassment is not an \nexcuse for his conduct. (Tr. 31-35) \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s February 2019 background interview, he made payment \narrangements to resolve his delinquent debts. He has a payment plan to pay $150 a \nmonth for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($10,400). He provided documentary proof to verify his \npayments and that he has reduced the balance owed to $8,875 as of December 2019. In \nMarch 2019, he paid a lump sum settlement payment ($3,900) to resolve the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b ($7,212). He negotiated a settlement for the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,255), \nin the amount of $2,364 with monthly payments of $65 to conclude in December 2022. \nHe has made the first payment on that debt. (Tr. 23-31; AE B, C, D) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has three credit card debts that have been delinquent since \napproximately 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to using credit cards to finance his \nparticipation in a real estate seminar. He later believed the seminar was a scam. After his \nbackground investigation, he made arrangements to pay his delinquent credit cards. He \nresolved one debt through a lump sum settlement payment and is making monthly \npayments to resolve the remaining two debts. Applicant has not completed the payment \nplans, so his debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant financed his participation in a real estate seminar with credit cards. He \nlater believed the seminar was a scam. His participation in the seminar and his means of \nfinancing the payment was voluntary and within his control. For the full application of AG \n\u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant did \nnot begin to address repayment of his three credit card debts until after he was \ninterviewed by a government investigator. However, since then he has settled one debt \nand has payment plans for the remaining two debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that he resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and is \nparticipating in payment plans to resolve the remaining two credit card debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose on his January 2019 SCA \nthat he had delinquent credit card debts because he was embarrassed. When asked \nabout his finances by a government investigator, he did not disclose the debts until he \nwas confronted with them by the investigator. The above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his omission, \nconcealment, or falsification to the Government before the investigator confronted him \nwith the facts. Instead, he told the investigator that he was meeting all of his financial \nobligations on time. When he was confronted with his delinquent debts, he admitted owing \nthem and attributed them to his participation in a real estate investment seminar that he \nfinanced with his credit cards. He admitted his failure to disclose the debts on his SCA \nand to the investigator was because he was embarrassed. Applicant\u2019s conduct is not \nminor. He had two opportunities to honestly disclose his delinquent debts, but intentionally \nfailed to do so. His embarrassment does not excuse his lack of candor and is not \nmitigating. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe above mitigating conditions do not apply.  \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. He experienced financial problems after he financed his \nparticipation in a real estate seminar with credit cards. When he realized that the business \nventure was likely a scam, he failed to pay the credit cards. Although he did not take \naction to resolve these debts until after the security clearance process began, I find he \nhas sufficiently addressed these debts, such that his finances are no longer a security \nconcern. Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nOf greater significance is Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his delinquent \ndebts on his SCA. Despite having an opportunity to disclose the information during his \nsubsequent background interview, he did not do sountil he was confronted with his debts \nby the investigator. The Government relies on applicants to be honest during their \nbackground investigations. If the investigator had not had the information available from \na credit report, the government may not have learned of the financial security concerns \nand Applicant\u2019s falsification. Applicant\u2019s embarrassment is not a substitute for being \nhonest. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, but failed to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Meyer, Esq. \n08/25/2020 \nDecision \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nSecurity concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) are fully addressed under \nGuideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse). He failed to mitigate security \nconcerns under Guideline H because his most recent marijuana use was on April 20, \n2018, and his marihuana use was inconsistent with his promises not to use marijuana in \n2014, 2015, and 2017. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 11, 2014, and October 18, 2017, Applicant completed and signed \nQuestionnaires for National Security Positions or security clearance applications (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1, GE 3) On September 10, 2019, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.

(HE \n2) On November 20, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On February 7, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.    \nOn February 19, 2020, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nApplicant\u2019s hearing for March 27, 2020. (HE 1A) The hearing was cancelled due to the \ncoronavirus. On July 28, 2019, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting Applicant\u2019s hearing \nfor August 4, 2020. (HE 1B) On August 3, 2020, the hearing was delayed until August 6, \n2020, due to bad weather. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, \ntime, and location of the hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 5-6). \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered \nseven exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. \n(Tr. 12-15, 38-39; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-G) On August 17, 2020, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

ISCR and ADP decisions and \nthe Directive are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations in whole or in \npart. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are \naccepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old analyst employed by a federal government contractor \nfor the previous three years.

(AE A) He has not served in the military. (GE 1) He is not \nmarried, and he does not have children. (GE 1) His employer recently promoted him to a \nleadership position. (AE D) In his current position, he is not involved with classified \ninformation. (Tr. 22) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency \nfrom about June 2011 to about July 2014. Applicant said he used marijuana on about five \nto ten occasions during this time period. (Tr. 25-26; AE F at 1) In his September 11, 2014 \nSCA Applicant disclosed his marijuana use; he said he used marijuana less than 10 times; \nand he said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.

On New Year\u2019s Eve in 2016, Applicant was intoxicated \nby alcohol consumption, and he took two puffs on a marijuana cigarette. (AE D) He held \na security clearance; however, at that time he did not have actual access to classified \ninformation. (Tr. 26-27; AE D) \nIn his October 18, 2017 SCA Applicant disclosed his marijuana use in 2016, and \nhe said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 27-28; GE 1) He explained, \n\u201cI would like to not compromise my clearance.\u201d (GE 1) His follow-up OPM PSI was on \nAugust 5, 2019. (GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege that Applicant used marijuana in April 2018, after \ncompleting his SCA on October 18, 2017, and while granted access to classified \ninformation. On April 20, 2018, Applicant was intoxicated from alcohol consumption. (AE \nD) He was with his friends when he consumed a cookie containing marijuana. (AE D) \nApplicant admitted he used marijuana on April 20, 2018 at a small gathering for the \nunofficial National Marijuana Holiday. (Tr. 28-31) He admitted he held a security \nclearance when he used marijuana. (AE D) \nApplicant said that after his marijuana use in April 2018, he improved his ability to \nmanage stress. (Tr. 18) He was intoxicated and under stress the two most recent times \nhe used marijuana. (Tr. 18) He started an exercise program one to three days a week to \nmanage stress, and he has \u201cstrictly limited contact with [his] family\u201d which is usually the \nsource of his stress. (Tr. 19) He has not consumed alcohol in months. (Tr. 32) On October \n4, 2019, and July 10, 2020, Applicant provided a hair sample, which tested negative for \nthe presence of a panel of illegal drugs, including marijuana. (AE F; AE G) \nOn October 18, 2019, a substance-abuse therapist assessed Applicant\u2019s \npropensity for future illegal drug use, and she concluded he was at a \u201cvery low risk\u201d to \nabuse illegal drugs because of his \u201chistory of sporadic, recreational use and the gravity \nof the consequences of his use outweighing its value to the client. The detrimental impact \non his security clearance and the risk of losing his job far exceed [marijuana\u2019s] usefulness \nto [Applicant].\u201d (Tr. 19; AE D at 2; AE F at 1, 4) Applicant does not associate with anyone \ninvolved in the 2016 marijuana use. (Tr. 20) He ended his association \u201cwith the majority \nof people\u201d who used marijuana with him in the past. (Tr. 20) \nApplicant received counseling about how to abstain from illegal drug use in the \nfuture, and he promised not to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 20-21) He provided a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. (Tr. 20-21; AE F; see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)) He promised not to use marijuana \nin the future because he has a better understanding on the adverse effect of using \nmarijuana on his access to classified information.

Appellant was honest about his marijuana \nuse on his September 11, 2014, and October 18, 2017, SCAs and in the follow-up OPM \nPSIs. He advised his employer of his marijuana use. (AE D) \nCharacter Evidence \nFive roommates, friends, and/or coworkers provided character statements \nsupporting reinstatement or continuation of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \n(AE E) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is friendly, conscientious, \nhonest, reliable, professional, stable, calm, empathetic, and trustworthy. He consumes \nalcohol in moderation (one or two drinks). His character witnesses are familiar with his \nmarijuana use as indicated in the SOR. None of his character statements said they \nobserved him using illegal drugs. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received any adverse employment actions, \nviolated security rules, or otherwise compromised national security. Appellant described \nhimself as being passionate about the protection of national security, and he indicated he \nis an excellent analyst who can contribute to national defense. (Tr. 21) A security \nclearance will enable him to make greater contributions to national security and the \nprotection of the United States. (Tr. 21) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cIt means such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation omitted). \u201cThe \nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under \nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence \nof nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant argued that the following cases involving illegal drug use where \nadministrative judges granted access to classified information were similar to his case: \nISCR Case No. 17-02653 (A.J. Mar. 25, 2019); ISCR Case No. 18-00041 (A.J. Jan. 23, \n2019); and ISCR Case No. 17-02117 (A.J. Oct. 15, 2018). (Tr. 37) \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-02117, the Applicant used illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance and abstained from illegal drug use for three years before his hearing. \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-02653, the Applicant used illegal drugs in November 2012 and July \n2014; he refrained from using illegal drugs from July 2014 to his hearing on June 7, 2018; \nand the administrative judge did not find that he used illegal drugs while holding a security \nclearance. In ISCR Case No. 18-00041, the Applicant used illegal drugs on multiple \noccasions until January 2015 while holding a security clearance, and he did not use illegal \ndrugs from January 2015 until his hearing on November 7, 2018. \nThe three cases Applicant cited are persuasive; however, they are not binding \nprecedent, and they are different from Applicant\u2019s case. For example, in none of these \ncases, did the Applicants promise security officials that they would not use illegal drugs \nand then break that promise and use illegal drugs. All three of the Applicants abstained \nfrom illegal drug use for at least three years. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. The \nAppeal Board has rejected \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent\u201d \nstating: \n[T]he Directive does not specify how much time must pass to mitigate the \nvarious types of misconduct identified in the adjudicative guidelines. \nContrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, the Board has repeatedly declined to \nestablish a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule for evaluating the recency of \nmisconduct. The extent to which security concerns have become mitigated \nthrough the passage of time is a question that must be resolved based on \nthe evidence as a whole.  \nISCR Case No. 18-02526 at 3 (Dec. 20, 2019) (rejecting two-year \u201cbenchmark\u201d for alcohol \nabstinence as key factor in mitigation of alcohol-related misconduct) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd.

In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the \nAppeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that \nthe judge excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and \nthe 20 plus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. \nFor the recency analysis the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant\u2019s last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by failing \nto give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that mitigating \ncondition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge \narticulated a rational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of \nApplicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation and format corrections \nadded). \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, \naffirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to revoke an applicant\u2019s security clearance \nafter considering the recency analysis of the administrative judge stating: \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and \nserious history of improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant \nwho was familiar with the security clearance process. That history included \nillegal marijuana use two to three times a year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use \nended four years before hearing]. It also included the illegal purchase of \nmarijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \nIn ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board \nreversed an unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge \nfailed to explain why drug use was not mitigated after the passage of more than six years \nfrom the previous drug abuse. In ISCR Case No. 14-00775 (App. Bd. July 2, 2015), the \nAppeal Board sustained the revocation of a security clearance for an Applicant, who did \nnot hold a security clearance that used marijuana 20 months before the administrative \njudge decided the case. \nIn this case, Applicant used marijuana about five times. He used marijuana twice \nwhile holding a security clearance. His most recent marijuana use was on April 20, 2018, \n28 months before his security clearance hearing. He promised not to use marijuana three \ntimes. Those three promises were made in a security context, twice on SCAs and once \nduring an OPM PSI. He violated those promises when he used marijuana on April 20, \n2018. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppellant did not believe he would use marijuana in the future for the following \nreasons: (1) he reduced stress in his life; (2) he has an exercise program; (3) he does not \nconsume alcohol; (4) he received some drug counseling; (5) he has limited access to or \nassociation with illegal drug users; and (6) he is motivated by employment considerations \nnot to use marijuana in the future. He understands that possession of marijuana violates \nfederal law and constitutes criminal conduct. I accept Applicant\u2019s statement that he \nintends to continue to abstain from illegal drug possession and use as credible. Applicant \nprovided \u201ca signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility.\u201d See AG \u00b6 26(b)(3).  \nApplicant has made positive steps towards rehabilitation; however, not enough \ntime has elapsed without marijuana use under the totality of circumstances to establish \nthat Applicant will continue to refrain from marijuana use in the future. His sincere intention \nnow not to use marijuana might not be adhered to in the future especially if he becomes \nintoxicated. Guideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 lists \u201cconditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying includ[ing]\u201d: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n  \n \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.

Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. (emphasis added to AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c) and 16(d). \nThe SOR alleges and the record establishes that Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana \npossession and marijuana use while holding a security clearance are \u201csufficient for an \nadverse determination under\u201d Guideline H. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) do not apply. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use in two SCAs, his OPM PSI, his SOR \nresponse, and at his hearing. His character witnesses and employer are aware of his \nmarijuana use. His history of marijuana use does not create a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress because Appellant has been open and transparent about his \nmarijuana use. The Guideline E allegations in this case are a duplication of the Guideline \nH allegations. AG \u00b6 16(d) expresses the Directive\u2019s intent not to duplicate allegations \nunder Guideline E that are made under another guideline. I find for Applicant under \nGuideline E because it is a duplication of the security concerns under the Guideline H. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old analyst employed by a federal government contractor \nfor the previous three years. In 2013, he received an associate\u2019s degree. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree with a major in history. His employer recently promoted him to a \nleadership position. \nFive roommates, friends, and/or coworkers provided character statements \nsupporting continuation of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. The general sense \nof their statements is that Applicant is friendly, conscientious, honest, reliable, \nprofessional, stable, calm, empathetic, and trustworthy. He consumes alcohol in \nmoderation (one or two drinks). See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, \n2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and commenting that security \nconcerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received any adverse employment actions, \nviolated security rules, or otherwise compromised national security. Appellant described \nhimself as being passionate about the protection of national security, and he indicated he \nis an excellent analyst who can contribute to national defense. A security clearance will \nenable him to make greater contributions to national security and the protection of the \nUnited States. \nAfter April 20, 2018, Applicant took steps to change, and he reduced stress in his \nlife and his alcohol consumption. He sincerely assured he will not use marijuana in the \nfuture. Nevertheless, I have lingering doubts about whether he will keep his promise not \nto use marijuana in the future. He previously promised three times in a security context \nthat he would not use marijuana again, and he broke those promises and used marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance in 2016 and on April 20, 2018. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 44-year-old single woman with one child, age 3. She earned an undergraduate degree in 1998, followed by a master\u2019s degree in 2005. She works for a defense contractor as a travel coordinator. (Tr. 18) She has worked for the same employer for the past six years. The SOR alleges a student loan delinquency totaling $32,110 (subparagraph 1.a). Applicant disputes this debt, contending that her grandmother, who paid for her college education, satisfied this loan in 2004. (GE 2 at 10) Moreover, Applicant asserts that she had no idea this debt appeared on her credit report as unresolved until she applied for a mortgage loan in 2008. (Tr. 14) She provided the bank\u2019s loan officer with a letter from the student loan creditor, dated August 24, 2004, notifying her that her student loan was fully satisfied. (GE 2 at 10) Subsequently, the mortgage loan was approved and Applicant purchased the home. (GE 3 at 1) Applicant received no further derogatory information about this allegedly outstanding loan until she applied for a security clearance in 2018.

Of the three remaining debts alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), the \nevidence the Government presented did not establish one of them, and the other two, \ncollectively totaling less than $2,200, do not generate a security risk, in light of Applicant\u2019s \nsalary and the absence of any other indicia of financial instability. Applicant has mitigated \nthe security risk. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nOn October 3, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with \nthe national security to grant security clearance eligibility. The SOR alleged four \ndelinquent debts (1.a \u2013 1.d). The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n\n2 \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn October 23, 2019,  Applicant answered the SOR, admitting subparagraph 1.a, \nadmitting 1.b, in part, and denying subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. She requested a hearing, \nwhereupon, the case was assigned to me on February 6, 2020. On February 19, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s \ncase for February 28, 2020. (Applicant waived her right to 15 days notice of hearing.)  The \nhearing was held as scheduled. I received four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4) and \nfive exhibits from Applicant (AE A - AE E), together with the testimony of Applicant. Also, I \nreceived a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I).  \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on March 6, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old single woman with one child, age 3. She earned an \nundergraduate degree in 1998, followed by a master\u2019s degree in 2005. She works for a \ndefense contractor as a travel coordinator. (Tr. 18) She has worked for the same employer \nfor the past six years. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a student loan delinquency totaling $32,110 (subparagraph 1.a). \nApplicant disputes this debt, contending that her grandmother, who paid for her college \neducation, satisfied this loan in 2004. (GE 2 at 10) Moreover, Applicant asserts that she \nhad no idea this debt appeared on her credit report as unresolved until she applied for a \nmortgage loan in 2008. (Tr. 14) She provided the bank\u2019s loan officer with a letter from the \nstudent loan creditor, dated August 24, 2004, notifying her that her student loan was fully \nsatisfied. (GE 2 at 10) Subsequently, the mortgage loan was approved and Applicant \npurchased the home. (GE 3 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant received no further derogatory information about this allegedly \noutstanding loan until she applied for a security clearance in 2018. (Tr. 32) Then, two \ncredit bureau reports generated as part of her background investigation noted that the debt \nstill existed, had been transferred to another lender, and was in collection. (GE 3 at 2; GE \n4 at 2)   When Applicant sent the new creditor a copy of the 2004 letter informing her that \nthe debt was satisfied, the creditor stated that this was not dispositive, and it instructed her \nto provide additional information, such as a cancelled check. (Tr. 36) By then, Applicant \ncould not procure any additional information from her grandmother because her \ngrandmother had been deceased for 12 years. \n \n \nApplicant then began searching for an attorney to contest the debt. (Tr. 38) While \nshe was looking for an attorney, the creditor garnished her wages for $700 monthly. (Tr. \n34) On February 12, 2020, Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement with the \ncreditor in which she agreed to satisfy the debt in $5 monthly payments. (AE B; Tr. 39) \nThis rehabilitation loan is a bridge to a federal government student loan for which \nApplicant applied on February 20, 2020. (AE A) Although Applicant still contends that the \nloan was satisfied in 2004, she has decided to continue executing a consolidation and \npayment plan in the event that her dispute is unsuccessful. (Tr. 37-38) \n\n3 \n \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b is a cable television bill allegedly totaling \n$795. Applicant admits that she owes the creditor money, but denies that the amount is as \nhigh as alleged in the SOR. Specifically, she admits that she was two months behind on \nher bill when she stopped service in June 2018, but contends that the total was $350, not \n$795. (Tr. 42; Answer at 2)  After receiving the bill with the allegedly incorrect amount due \nin September 2018, Applicant began contacting the creditor to dispute it. (Tr. 41) Despite \nmultiple attempts to contact the creditor, she has yet to receive a response. She does not \nwant to pay the $350 balance that she agrees is owed unless she can verify with the \ncreditor that that amount represents the full and final amount due. (Tr. 42) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c totals $1,304. Applicant disputes it, \ncontending that she once had a credit-card account with this company, but that she \nsatisfied it ten years ago. She disputed it online, but provided no documentary evidence \nsupporting her contention. (Tr. 46) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d totals $1,633. Applicant contends that she \nsatisfied this debt. Specifically, she had a previous account with the same credit card \ncompany. When she closed it several years ago, there was no outstanding balance.  \nApplicant contends that payments to the account alleged in subparagraph 1.d were being \nerroneously credited to the old account.  The only exhibit the Government submitted in \nsupport of the existence of this debt is a credit bureau report which indicates that the bill is \nin dispute and that Applicant formally disputed it six months before she underwent her \ninvestigative interview. (GE 4 at 5)  It no longer appears on any of her updated credit \nreports. (AE C - AE E)  \n \n \nApplicant earns $91,000 annually. (Tr. 18) She contributes 5 percent each pay \nperiod to her retirement plan and saves $100 each month in a college savings account. \n(Tr. 58) Her mortgage payments and her car note payments are current.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \n\n4 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security \ndecision. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nThe only evidence the Government provided in support of its contention that the \ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.d is delinquent is a credit bureau report that indicates that \nit is in dispute status. In light of Applicant\u2019s denial, this is insufficient to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s initial burden of proof. (Directive, \u00b6 3.1.14)  I resolve subparagraph 1.d in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nThe remaining SOR debts trigger the application of the disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d The largest SOR debt is a student loan. Applicant contends that her \ngrandmother satisfied it more than 15 years ago, and provided a letter from the creditor \nsupporting this contention. Arguably, this is not dispositive, as the original creditor may \nhave designated it as satisfied after the current creditor paid it off in exchange for the \nassignment of the right of collection. At minimum, the satisfaction letter constitutes a \nsubstantiated, good-faith basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt, particularly \ngiven that Applicant can no longer verify the debt\u2019s repayment with her since-deceased \ngrandmother. Although Applicant continues to deny responsibility for this debt, she has \nmade payment arrangements in the event that her efforts at disputing the debt are \nunsuccessful. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant did not provide documentary evidence substantiating her dispute \nof the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, they are collectively less than $2,200. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s annual salary and the absence of any other indicia of financial problems, \nI conclude these nominal unresolved debts generate little to no security concern. Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 21, 2018. \nOn August 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions \nissued on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 28, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \n\n \n2 \n \nnotice of hearing on December 11, 2019, and the hearing was convened on January 15, \n2020. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted no additional evidence. The record was held \nopen to permit submission of additional documentary evidence, but nothing was \nsubmitted within the allotted time period. DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nJanuary 24, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old strength coach for a defense contractor, employed since \n2017. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. He served \non active duty in the United States Army Reserve from 1999 to 2007, and was activated \nfrom 2001 to 2003. He deployed to Qatar for eight months in 2001 to 2002. He married in \n2009, but separated in July 2015 and is planning to divorce. He has three children, ages \n5, 9, and 14. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $83,000 in delinquent debts, \nincluding substantial student loans, and some medical and utility debts. He admitted all \nof the SOR allegations except for a small medical collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.u). \nApplicant testified that his student loan debts fell into default because of his pending \ndivorce, but he intends to arrange payment plans. He noted that while in college, he had \na garnishment order to collect student loans, but has not had contact with loan servicing \ncompanies since. He noted that his financial priority was resolving the divorce before \npaying student loans. He has not taken action to resolve the remaining utility and medical \ndebts, however he believes he paid the medical debts listed on his credit report that are \nin a collection status, including SOR \u00b6 1.h. No documentary evidence of such payments \nor account resolutions was submitted. \n \nApplicant testified that his spouse did not work, and he did not earn enough to pay \nhis expenses and student loans. He hired a credit-repair company but only used them for \nabout five months before closing the account. He has about $500 net remainder after \npaying expenses, and currently about $3,000 in bank savings, although he usually has \nonly $200 to $300 in savings at any given time. There is no evidence that Applicant has \nhad financial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n5 \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that remain unresolved, including \nsizable student loan debts. The debts appear to have resulted from an insufficient income \nto pay for family expenses and student loans. Applicant has not shown sufficient efforts \nto resolve his delinquent debts and there is insufficient evidence to show that the debts \nwill be resolved. Applicant\u2019s financial status has been poor for some time, and there is \ninsufficient evidence that it will improve in the near future. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial \nstatus raise significant doubts about his financial management decisions, personal \nresponsibility, and ability to address delinquent debts. I am not convinced Applicant \nmakes good financial decisions, and his financial status continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No mitigating condition fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 10, 2018. On \nJuly 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 20, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On October 1, 2019, Department Counsel amended the \nSOR to include allegations under Guidelines G and J. Applicant answered the amended \nSOR on October 24, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice \nof hearing on December 9, 2019, for a scheduled hearing on January 14, 2020. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. \n \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into evidence. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A into evidence. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter and summary of exhibits were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HE) 1 and 2, and appended to the record. Applicant testified \nat the hearing. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional documentary \nevidence in mitigation. He submitted a statement (email) and additional documents, \ncollectively marked as AE B, and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on January 24, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old design engineer employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2019. He was previously employed as a shipyard contractor employee from \n2004 to 2019. Applicant graduated from high school in 1999, and completed some college \ncredits. He married in 2002, separated in about 2008, and divorced in 2010. He remarried \nin 2018 and has two children that do not live with him. He served on active duty in the \nUnited States Air Force from 2000 until he was honorably discharged in 2004. \n \nThe original SOR alleges Applicant has four delinquent debts totaling about \n$45,000. The debts include a home equity line of credit and credit card accounts. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations. The amended SOR alleges \nunder guideline G, that Applicant was arrested in September 2019 for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). The DUI allegation was cross alleged under Guideline J. \nApplicant admitted the DUI arrest, but denied the cross allegation under Guideline J. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a home equity line of credit (HELOC) debt with his former \nspouse. According to Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report, the last payment on the loan was in \nOctober 2013. Applicant\u2019s December 2008 separation agreement permitted him to live in \nthe property and pay expenses until it was sold, but his former spouse was responsible \nfor paying the HELOC as required. She did not do so, and the HELOC debt was eventually \ncharged off. Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) for the \ncharged-off amount. The account is resolved. Of note, but not alleged in the SOR, \nApplicant and his mother lived in the home for about one year without paying the majority \nof mortgage payments as required, and the home was foreclosed around 2009. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a consumer credit card debt. The debt was placed for collection in \nJune 2018. Applicant negotiated a settlement and paid the debt in June 2018. This \naccount is resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.c is another credit account with the most recent payment \nbeing paid in August 2017. Applicant resolved it in Jan 2018 and it was removed from his \n\n \n3 \n \ncredit report. This account is resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.d is a home improvement credit card \naccount that fell into default and was charged off in about January 2018. Applicant \ntestified that he paid the debt in 2018, and it was removed from his credit report. This \naccount is resolved. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a house in February 2019, and has not missed a house \npayment. He has bank savings accounts valued at about $5,000, a 401K retirement \naccount valued at about $10,000, and a pension fund with over $40,000. His current \nspouse works at the same government facility as he does. He has not had financial \ncounseling. \n \n \nIn September 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He met his spouse at a \nrestaurant/bar to discuss plans for their wedding anniversary. When he left, he was \nstopped for not maintaining his lane, and failed the field-sobriety test. His blood alcohol \nlevel tested at .13%, well over the legal limit. He was confined and released on bail. He \npleaded not guilty in September 2019, and is awaiting trial. Applicant had a previous DUI \nin 2006 that was resolved in 2007 with a dismissal after completing probation and an \nalcohol and substance abuse program. He has not submitted to a medical or substance \nabuse evaluation, although after the hearing in this case, he attempted to contact \ncounselors that would accept a new client, but so far he has been unsuccessful in \nscheduling a program. He noted that he uses a ride share service after drinking when a \ndesignated driver is unavailable. He claims that he drinks one to two beers a week on a \nsocial basis. No character or work performance evidence was submitted. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant financial considerations disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 \ninclude: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a), (b), and (c). \n \nThe following financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant claims his debts were largely due to a separation from his spouse; \nhowever, he defaulted on his credit card debts well after his divorce in November 2010. \nHe lived in the marital home without paying the mortgage for which he was responsible \n(not alleged in the SOR), and his spouse defaulted on the HELOC, which was the largest \ndebt alleged in the SOR. At the time, Applicant had a full-time job that he held since 2004.  \n \nApplicant resolved all of the SOR debts and was issued a 1099-C for the charged-\noff HELOC. The HELOC was the responsibility of his former spouse, although it was a \njoint account. Applicant has not received financial counseling, however, it appears the \ndebts are behind him; he has established financial solvency; a track record of on-time \n\n \n6 \n \npayments; and with his current spouse, purchased a home and has been making \npayments as required. \n \nThere are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are resolved \nand his financial status is under control. I find that additional financial delinquencies are \nunlikely to recur, and his current financial status does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, . . ., regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use \nor whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of DUI arrests and alcohol-related impaired judgment, meets \nthe conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c). \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23, including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant has two DUI arrests, the last in 2019 that is still pending trial or other \nresolution. Insufficient time has passed to know whether his alcohol consumption has \nchanged to prevent a recurrence of alcohol-related incidents. Little convincing evidence \nof recent, successful abstinence or alcohol consumption in moderation has been \nproffered. He has not undergone alcohol abuse counseling or a medical evaluation after \nhis most recent arrest to determine whether he has a drinking problem. I am not convinced \nthat Applicant demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption; is \nmaking satisfactory progress toward a medical evaluation or treatment program given his \nhistory of DUI\u2019s; or that he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconduct to prevent a recurrence. No evidence of work performance or character was \npresented. Despite Applicant\u2019s testimony, there remains significant doubts about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. No mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, anyone of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, rel9iability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nconcerning his alcohol-related misconduct are sufficient to establish the disqualifying \nconditions above. \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence in mitigation. The last DUI offense \nis recent and still pending judicial action. There has been no evidence of rehabilitation, a \ngood employment record, or convincing character evidence to mitigate Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct or to convince me that this conduct will not recur.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, divorce, and remarriage with an improved financial record. I \nbelieve Applicant adequately addressed his financial delinquencies, but has not shown \nthat his alcohol consumption is under control and criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe financial consideration security concerns, but not the alcohol consumption or criminal \nconduct concerns. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

Applicant \nanswered (Answer) the SOR on August 19, 2019, and requested a decision on the record \nwithout a hearing.  \nOn September 11, 2019, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining six Items, was mailed to Applicant. She received the FORM on September 18, \n2019. The FORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 4, 2019. Items 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence without objection.  \n\n \n \n2\nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and has worked as a dispatcher for a defense contractor \nsince June 2017. She is single and has one minor child. Applicant has attended some \ncommunity college courses. (Item 4; Item 5) \n \nApplicant was unemployed from August 2008 to June 2009; March 2015 to \nFebruary 2016; August 2016 to October 2016; and January 2017 to April 2017. She \nmoved across the country in March 2015 and was unable to find employment. \nAdditionally, she was fired from a position in October 2016. (Item 4; Item 5) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has seventeen delinquent debts, totaling over \n$42,000. The debts became delinquent between approximately 2014 and 2018. The \nmajority of the debts are related to revolving accounts, utility bills, a repossessed vehicle, \nand a debt related to an apartment lease. (Item 1; Item 5; Item 6; Item 7) \n \nDuring her March 2019 personal subject interviews with a government investigator, \nApplicant indicated that her debts were the result of her various periods of unemployment \nand her maternity leave following the May 2018 birth of her son. She is willing to repay \nher financial obligations, but does not have the resources and, as a result, has not yet \nresolved the delinquent debts. Applicant has not attended credit counseling. (Item 5)   \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the alleged debts, but provided no \nexplanation, additional information, or supporting documentation. She did not respond to \nthe FORM. (Item 2; Item 3) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n\n \n \n3\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate those security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n\n \n \n4\n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \n \nOver the years, Applicant has experienced several periods of unemployment. \nSome of these appear to have been beyond her control. However, she still has a \nresponsibility to pay debts that she incurred, and she failed to meet her burden of \nproduction and persuasion to show that she acted responsibly to address her delinquent \ndebts. There is no record evidence that she has made payments toward the alleged debts. \nTherefore, Applicant has not demonstrated that she has made a good-faith effort to repay \nher overdue creditors or resolve her debts. \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to show that her finances are in good standing and \nthat circumstances have changed. I find that Applicant will likely allow her debts to \ncontinue to become or remain delinquent. Applicant provided no evidence of credit \ncounseling. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) was not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \n \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \n\n \n \n5\ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns at issue. The record lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she has \nresolved the alleged delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United \nStates to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

(Government Exhibit 4.) On August 9, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \ndetailing \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective within the DoD after June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on September 3, 2019. (Government \nExhibit 3.)  She requested that her case be decided by an administrative judge on the \nwritten record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nNovember 15, 2019.   A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \n\n \n2 \n \ncontaining five Items was received by Applicant on December 1, 2019.  She was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant submitted no response to \nthe FORM within the 30-day period.  DOHA assigned the case to me on January 21, \n2020.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and is unmarried.  She has a bachelor\u2019s degree.  She is \nemployed by a defense contractor as a Junior Architect/Engineer.  She is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified three allegations.  Applicant failed to file her Federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax year 2016.  She also failed to pay her Federal and State \nincome taxes for tax year 2016.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the \nSOR.  Applicant began working for her current employer in August 2018.   \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated October 4, 2018, \nwherein she indicates that her Federal and state income tax returns were not filed on \ntime due to the fact that she experienced a period of high stress from working full time \nand taking care of her grandfather.  Her focus was not her taxes and as a result she \nbecame delinquent.  Her plan at that time was to pay her back taxes owed in the \namount of approximately $11,000 to the Federal tax authorities by obtaining a loan.  \nShe planned to pay the state approximately $2,000 she believed she owed for the 2016 \ntax year.  (Government Exhibit 5.)   \n \nDuring a personal subject interview on January 22, 2019, Applicant explained \nthat she had attempted to file both her Federal and state income tax returns for tax year \n2016 online, but was unable to do so because she did not have the money to make the \nfull payments that were owed.  She explained that she did take out a loan for the \npurpose of paying her taxes but instead she used it to purchase a vehicle, and for a \ndown payment on a house.  She now plans to take out another loan or use credit cards \nto pay the back taxes she owes.  (Government Exhibit 5.)     \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant contends that she has now filed her Federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2016 and that she has set up a payment plan to resolve \nher delinquent back taxes owed.  She states that the payments are automatically \ndeducted from her checking account each month until the debt is paid in full.  She has \nnot provided any documentary evidence to support this assertion.  The letter from the \n\n \n3 \n \nIRS she provided reflects a tentative agreement accepting her proposal to pay the \nbalance due for tax year 2018, not for tax year 2016.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant also states that she has filed her state income tax returns and has now \npaid her state back taxes owed for tax year 2016.  She provided a copy of a cancelled \ncheck in the amount of $2,184 made out to the state tax authorities.  (Government \nExhibit 3.)  However, there is still nothing in the record to support the fact that Applicant \nhas resolved all of the back taxes owed to the state for tax year 2016, or that she is now \nin good standing with the state tax authorities.  Applicant has not provided sufficient \ndocumentary evidence to support her contentions.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to file her 2016 Federal and state income tax returns in a timely \nfashion.  She also failed pay her Federal and state income tax for tax year 2016.  The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n  \nIt is understandable that taking care of an elderly family member and working full \ntime can be stressful and is quite a responsibility.  However, that is not an excuse for \nfailing to file ones income tax returns or failing to pay taxes.  At this point, it is not clear \nfrom the record evidence whether Applicant has filed the Federal and state income tax \nreturns in question, and/or whether she has satisfied her tax obligations for tax year \n2016.  Applicant failed to respond to the FORM and thereby waived her opportunity to \nprovide sufficient evidence in mitigation.  From the assertions made, without additional \nsupporting documentation, it cannot be determined if her income tax returns have been \nfiled or her back taxes for tax year 2016 have been paid.    Applicant has not explained \nwhat payments, if any, she has made or is making to the Federal tax authorities.  \nAccordingly, mitigating conditions \u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g), do not provide full mitigation \nin this case.  There is no clear evidence in the record that she has acted reasonably and \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  In fact, her inaction reflects unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n6 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/17/2020 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 2, 2018. \nOn August 14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 10, 2019, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. On October 16, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 6. She was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on \nOctober 22, 2019, and did not respond. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. I \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted Items 3 through 6 into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included 11 \nattachments that I admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 3, 2020. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), her \nSCA (Item 3), and the summary of her security clearance interview (Item 4). Item 4 was \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 4. The Government included in the FORM a prominent \nnotice advising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the \nground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if she did not raise \nany objection to Item 4 in her response to the FORM, or if she did not respond to the \nFORM, she could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 4 \ncould be considered as evidence in her case. Applicant received the FORM, including a \ncopy of Item 4, but neither responded to the FORM nor otherwise objected to Item 4. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 34, married her second husband in November 2017. She divorced \nher first husband of three years in December 2016. She has one minor child with her \nfirst husband, and two stepchildren with her second husband (one minor and one adult). \nShe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008 and master\u2019s degree in 2011, from the same \nuniversity. She attended a different university from 2014 through 2016, without earning \na degree. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2010, during \nwhich time she has been promoted five times, most recently in April 2016. She was \ninitially employed as an administrative assistant and now works as a program director. \nShe is seeking to upgrade the DOD security clearance granted to her in August 2018.  \n \nOn her October 2018 SCA, Applicant reported approximately $120,000 of \ndelinquent federal student-loan debt. She explained that she fell behind with her \nmonthly loan payments following the separation from her first husband. She separated \non an unspecified date due to his adultery and abusive actions against her and their \ninfant child. She incurred substantial expenses to set up a new life for her and her child. \nShe has not received any financial support from her first husband, and he has never \npaid his $725 monthly child support obligation. As of September 2019, he was \napproximately $20,000 in arrears. The record did not specify her income and expense \nhistory from before, during, or after the separation. (Item 2 at 3; Item 3 at 42-43) \n \nApplicant has been in contact with her student-loan lenders at various times prior \nto and since her 2016 divorce. She has made requests for forbearance, deferment, and \nrepayment plans, and also \u201cmade payments when [she] could.\u201d While some of her \nrequests were granted, others were not because the lenders considered only her \nincome and not her monthly obligations. In June 2012 and December 2013, her \nforbearance requests were approved by one of her lenders. That same lender approved \ndeferments in September 2014 and December 2014. Between February 2013 and July \n2014, she scheduled four unspecified payments for unspecified student-loan accounts. \n\n \n3 \n \nBetween May 2015 and June 2018, she sent ten payments totaling $1,343 for \nunspecified student-loan accounts. In about 2017, at least one of her income tax \nrefunds (of an unspecified amount) was applied towards one of her unspecified student \nloans. In October 2018, she requested an income-driven repayment plan, which was \napproved as of August 2019. There is no evidence in the record of any payments made \nsince June 2018. (AE G, H; Item 2; Item 3 at 43; Item 4 at 7; Items 5, 6) \n \nThe August 2019 SOR alleged four student-loan debts totaling $288,526, \nincluding the federal student-loan debt reported on Applicant\u2019s SCA, which was in \ncollection status with a $126,126 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The three other alleged debts \nincluded: 1) a collection account with a $54,272 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (while not \nspecified in the record, this account appears to be likely related to the eight private-\nloans she borrowed between January and August 2009 with a major commercial bank, \nwhich initially totaled $38,197); 2) a collection account with a balance of $42,306 for a \n$24,000 loan she borrowed in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and 3) another federal \nstudent-loan account in collection status with a balance of $65,822 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The \nSOR also alleged a $102 consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d), which Applicant had resolved \nbefore the issuance of the SOR. Each of the alleged SOR debts were established by \nthe credit reports. (AE I; Items 1, 2; Item 5 at 1-2; Item 6 at 4, 9-11, 13, 18) \n \nIn her September 2019 SOR answer, Applicant admitted that the four student-\nloan accounts alleged in the SOR had not yet been resolved, but denied them as \nalleged in the SOR, apparently based on a concern that the amounts claimed to be \nowed may be incorrect. However, she asserted that she fully intends to repay them \nonce she receives \u201ccomplete and accurate proof of debt.\u201d Three of the accounts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and 1.d) were combined and placed for collection with one agency, and the \nfourth account (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was placed for collection with another agency. In August \n2019, she sent certified letters to those two agencies to dispute the debts in order to \nrequire the agencies to affirm the legitimacy of the debts and the accuracy of the \namounts that are claimed to be owed. Although the letters had been received by the \nagencies, she had not received any response from them as of the date of her SOR \nanswer. However, she received information from her credit monitoring service that two \ncredit bureaus removed the collection account for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b from \nApplicant\u2019s credit report. One of the agencies noted that the removal was due to: 1) an \nincorrect balance or past due amount, and 2) the contract related to the collection \naccount having been cancelled. (AE K; Item 2) \n \nApplicant is a valued employee who has earned high praise and recognition for \nher contributions. Her duties as program manager require that she maintain a security \nclearance. She has not had any financial counseling. (AE A-F; Item 2; Item 4 at 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527) \n\n \n4 \n \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts, which were corroborated by the credit reports, \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy \ndebts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nI find the allegation concerning the $102 consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) that \nApplicant resolved before the issuance of the SOR in her favor. However, Applicant has \nneither resolved her substantial delinquent student-loan debts, including federal loans, \nnor established a specific plan to address them. She also did not proffer sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that the amounts alleged in the SOR, as corroborated by the \ncredit reports, are incorrect. The fact that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was removed \nfrom her credit report does not absolve her from repaying it given that she has not \nestablished a legitimate basis to dispute it. Moreover, the credit bureau agency\u2019s \nrationale for its removal appeared related to the collection account but not necessarily \nthe underlying debt. \n \nApplicant did not establish that her financial situation largely resulted from \ncircumstances beyond her control or that she acted responsibly to address her \ndelinquent loans. She has been steadily employed full time since 2010. Her loan \nforbearance history suggests that she had problems making her student-loan payments \nprior to her 2016 divorce. Moreover, the record contains insufficient detail and \ndocumentation concerning her relevant income and expense history. \n \nWhile Applicant is credited with initiating efforts at various times prior to and \nsince her 2016 divorce to request forbearance, deferment, and repayment plans, she \nonly corroborated ten payments totaling $1,343 for her student loans between 2015 and \n2018. She has not received any financial counseling, nor demonstrated that she has a \nhandle on her student loans. While she is on the right track by establishing an income-\ndriven repayment plan as of August 2019 for at least one of the loans, there is no \nevidence that she made any payments or is able to follow through with the plan. She \nhas also not resolved any of the other alleged loans, nor established a meaningful track \nrecord of voluntary payments to suggest that she is able to follow through with her \npromise to resolve them once she is confident about the accuracy of amounts claimed \nto be owed. Thus, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by her failure to resolve her substantial federal and other student-loan \ndebts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He became aware that he needed to resolve his student loans referred \nfor collection in 2018, after his employer asked him to apply for a DOD security clearance. \nHe made sporadic contact with the creditor the following two years. He had some difficulty \ndetermining the specific creditor holding his student loans, and getting the creditor to \nreturn his phone calls. Applicant admitted he did not diligently pursue a repayment \nagreement with the creditor due to \u201clack of time,\u201d or he just \u201cforgot.\u201d It was not until he \nreceived his hearing notice in February 2020 that he made setting up a student loan \npayment plan a priority. The student loan creditor recently received Applicant\u2019s tax forms \nand is in the process of calculating the appropriate amount of his monthly student loan \nrepayment. (Tr. 28-37; GE 2, GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant is current on filing his income tax returns. His 2017 tax refund of about \n$900 was intercepted by the Government and applied to his delinquent student loan \nbalance. He does not a have a monthly budget in place, and he has not participated in \nany financial counseling. Applicant is interested in getting the Dave Ramsey videos from \nhis friend to learn more about how to properly manage his money. (Tr. 40-42, 52-53) \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or \nsupporting documentation of Applicant\u2019s resolution efforts with his delinquent student \nloans. Aside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements and the most recent credit \nreport, there is no documentary evidence showing that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, \nsettled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the student loans. Applicant failed to \nsubmit any corroborating or substantiating documentation even though Department \nCounsel noted at the hearing that current bank statements, e-mail communications, and \na final repayment agreement from the creditor would be appropriate types of documents \nthat Applicant could provide to mitigate his case. The record was held open for three \nweeks for this endeavor, but Applicant failed to submit any documentation. (Tr. 36-37)   \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent \nstudent loans on his 2018 SCA. He admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR, \nand also listed that he did not fully understand the question. At the hearing, Applicant \nstated that after he read the SCA question, he thought he was supposed to disclose \ndelinquent personal loans only, and he did not even consider listing his delinquent student \nloans. He credibly denied that he purposely tried to hide his adverse student loan \ninformation from the Government, or during the course of his security clearance \ninvestigation. \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \n Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nApplicant did not provide supporting documentation to show he made payments or \narranged payment plans with his student loan creditor. His 2017 income tax refund was \nintercepted as a partial payment toward his delinquent student loans because he failed \nto pay them voluntarily. This does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve debts or \nrepay overdue creditors. His eight student loans total about $24,312, and the two unpaid \nmedical accounts add an additional $179 to his overall delinquent balance. During his \nearly 2019 background interview, he had stated that if he determined the medical \naccounts were his responsibility, he would make lump sum payments within one to two \nmonths. Applicant has not taken responsible action in the handling of his delinquent \nfinancial responsibilities.  \n \nDespite holding the record open for three weeks, Applicant did not provide \nsufficient documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) proof of payments, for \nexample, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the \ncreditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) correspondence \nto or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of credible debt \ndisputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he did not \nbelieve he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence of \nattempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to \nshow that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or \nresolution. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nUnder all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Appellant deliberately failed to list his delinquent student \nloan accounts on the SCA, as required. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 \n17:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAppellant did not understand that he had to disclose his delinquent student loans \non the SCA. He thought the question pertained to delinquent personal loans only. It was \nnot his intent to deceive security officials by providing false information in his SCA about \nhis finances. Applicant\u2019s sincerity at the hearing was convincing that his omissions were \ncaused by a misunderstanding of the SCA financial question. I find his omission on his \nSCA was not intended to deceive, and his conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. There is sufficient evidence to apply AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, and he has been employed as a production assembler \ntechnician since September 2018 for a DOD contractor. His annual salary is \napproximately $25,000. \n \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \nprogress resolving two relatively small delinquent medical accounts or eight student loans \nreferred for collection. There is no evidence of progress (payments or payment plans), in \nthe last two years for any of the SOR debts, and he did not show good faith or responsible \nfinancial action in the handling of his delinquent debt. Overall, Applicant\u2019s conduct raises \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Although he mitigated \nthe personal conduct security concerns, Applicant failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns.   \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nFor APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on October 29, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 28, \n2020. The hearing was convened as scheduled on February 20, 2020.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence over Applicant\u2019s \nobjection.

He submitted \n\n \n2 \n \ndocuments that I have marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and A(1) through A(7) and \nadmitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iraq. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.d by changing the year \u201c2018\u201d \nto \u201c2008\u201d was granted without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He returned to serve in the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Guard \nfrom 2006 to 2008. He worked under dangerous conditions in Iraq as a linguist for the \nU.S. military from 2008 to 2010. Because of his work, he was eligible for a special \nimmigrant visa. He immigrated to the United States in 2010. He became a U.S. citizen \nin 2015. (Tr. at 15-18, 34, 38-44, 68-73, 84-87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \nApplicant is one of four children. His parents and one of his siblings are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His father was a senior military officer, but he retired more than 30 \nyears ago. His brother in Iraq is a retired technician. His two other siblings live in the \nUnited States.

He does not own any property in Iraq. His wife is a \ncitizen and resident of Thailand. He visits her from Kuwait. He bought a condominium in \nThailand for the equivalent of about $90,000 as an investment. The condominium is in a \nresort area that is distant from where his wife lives. (Tr. at 45, 48-4975-77, 80, 88-90; \nGE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant expressed his undivided loyalty to the United States.

(AE A, A(1)-A(7))  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother are citizens and residents of Iraq. The potential \nfor terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it \ncontinues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.  \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s past service in the Iraqi military does not raise a current security \nconcern. SOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \n\n \n6 \n \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist for the U.S. military in \nIraq from 2008 to 2010, which earned him a special immigrant visa. U.S. military \npersonnel who worked with him praised his service. I find that Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him high praise from U.S. \nmilitary personnel. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of \naction in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n20, 2007). The complicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his family members in Iraq do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant initially admitted most of the SOR allegations, with brief comments, but he eventually changed some of his positions, and admitted only some of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.g.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant\u2019s current employment status is unclear. He is reported to be a 41-year- old employee of a defense contractor. While Department Counsel stated that Applicant has been serving in an unspecified position with an identified defense contractor since March 2017, there is no evidence to indicate when he first started working for that contractor, or what his current position might be. In February 2020, he self-reported that he is a full-time employee with a locks and locksmith security company. He has also been self-employed as the owner of a technical company where he has worked part-time since March 2013.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 8, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (2013 SF 86). On December 12, 2016, he \nsubmitted another Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2016 SF 86). On an \nunspecified date, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on May \n22, 2019. On August 30, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nhim, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated October 17, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, \nand requested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge. However, on \nNovember 21, 2019, he submitted another sworn statement, and this time he elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy \nof the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 19, 2019, and he was \nafforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 10, 2020. His response was due on February \n2, 2020. Applicant responded to the FORM and submitted a response with several \ndocuments attached to it. Those materials were admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on February 14, 2020. The record closed on February 14, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant initially admitted most of the SOR allegations, \nwith brief comments, but he eventually changed some of his positions, and admitted only \nsome of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., \n1.d., and 1.g.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant\u2019s current employment status is unclear. He is reported to be a 41-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. While Department Counsel stated that Applicant \nhas been serving in an unspecified position with an identified defense contractor since \nMarch 2017, there is no evidence to indicate when he first started working for that \ncontractor, or what his current position might be. In February 2020, he self-reported that \nhe is a full-time employee with a locks and locksmith security company. He has also been \nself-employed as the owner of a technical company where he has worked part-time since \nMarch 2013. With the exception of one relatively brief period of unemployment from \nOctober 2011, when he was terminated from a position, until January 2012, he served in \na variety of full-time positions with various other companies since April 2006. (Item 3, at \n11-17; Item 7, at 4-6; Response to the FORM) \n \nIt is unclear if he is a high school graduate. He attended a community college for \ntwo years, and while he earned some college credits, he did not receive a degree. \nDepartment Counsel stated that he had been granted eligibility for a position of public \ntrust in August 2013, but Applicant merely referred to an unspecified clearance to work in \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \na federal building on that date. (Item 3, at 33) He has never served with the U.S. military. \nHe has never been married. He has two children, born in 2007 and 2011. \n  \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated March 10, 2017); Item 5 (Responses to Interrogatories, \ndated May 22, 2019); Item 7 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 9, 2017); \nItem 3 (2016 SF 86), dated December 12, 2016); Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, \nvarious dates); and Response to the FORM, dated February 8, 2020. \nWhen Applicant completed his 2016 SF 86 in December 2016, he reported that he \nhad one issue associated with his failure to timely file his federal income tax return for the \ntax year 2015. He denied that there were any delinquent accounts. (Item 3, at 34-36) On \nNovember 9, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). During the interview, he acknowledged his failure to \ntimely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2014 as well. After he denied \nhaving any delinquent debts, upon being confronted by the investigator, Applicant \nacknowledged having some delinquent accounts but continued to deny having any \nknowledge of the vast majority of the accounts identified by the investigator. He indicated \nthat he would look into the identified debts, and if he owes the particular debt(s), he will \nmake payment arrangements. He attributed his financial difficulties to contractors who \nwere not paying him in a timely manner to enable him to maintain his accounts in a current \nstatus; he was too busy to file his income tax returns; and his inability to obtain necessary \ntax information to enable him to file his income tax returns. (Item 7, at 7-10; Item 5, at 2)   \nThe SOR alleged a failure to timely file his federal income tax returns for a multi-\nyear period, as well as seven delinquent accounts totaling $21,417, as set forth as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018.  (Item 5, at 2; Item 7, at 7-8) Applicant \nadmitted the allegation. (Item 2) Attached to his Response to the FORM, he submitted \ncopies of his individual income tax returns for the tax years 2014 (undated), 2015 (dated \nJanuary 22, 2020), 2017 (dated January 22, 2020), and 2018 (undated). Other than the \ndates on some of the income tax forms, he failed to submit documentation, such as an \nIRS account transcript, to indicate the dates when the income tax returns were actually \nfiled. Nevertheless, even accepting the dates appearing on the individual income tax \nreturns as accurate, it appears that the income tax returns for the alleged tax years were \nnot timely filed.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to Applicant\u2019s estimated $15,000 indebtedness to the U.S. \nTreasury for delinquent income taxes for the tax years 2014 through 2018. He admitted \nthe allegation and indicated that the situation was caused by spreading himself too thin \nand failing to take care of his personal things while focusing on contractor jobs. (Item 2; \nItem 5, at 3-5) On February 8, 2020, he stated that he \u201cwill . . . be setting up a monthly \npayment arrangement with the [Internal Revenue Service] (IRS),\u201d but he did not assert \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nthat any payments had already been made by him, and he did not submit any documents \nto indicate that he or anyone on his behalf had contacted the IRS to establish an \ninstallment agreement. The delinquencies remain unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid balance \nof $219 that was placed for collection in 2017, and eventually purchased by another \nlender. (Item 6, at 7) During his OPM interview, Applicant denied any knowledge of the \naccount, but stated that he would make payment arrangements if he determines that he \nowes the debt. (Item 7, at 8) He took no action until after the SOR was issued, but finally \npaid the creditor an unspecified amount to reduce the balance to zero. (Letter, dated \nOctober 24, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) The account has been \nresolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is a medical account from an ambulance company for one of his \nchildren with an unpaid balance of $1,344 that was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 6, \nat 5) During his OPM interview, Applicant denied any knowledge of the account, but stated \nthat he would make payment arrangements if he determines that he owes the debt. (Item \n7, at 9) In his Answer to the SOR, he acknowledged that the bill was associated with one \nof his children, and he stated that he would address the issue. (Item 2) As of the date the \nrecord closed, he did not assert that any payments had already been made by him. The \naccount remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $232 \nthat was placed for collection in 2017. (Item 6, at 5) During his OPM interview, Applicant \ndenied any knowledge of the account, but stated that he would make payment \narrangements if he determines that he owes the debt. (Item 7, at 9) In his Answer to the \nSOR, he acknowledged that the bill was associated with his failure to return a device to \nthe creditor, and he stated that he would pay it. (Item 2) As of the date the record closed, \nhe did not assert that any payments had already been made by him. The account remains \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to an Internet or cable television account with an unpaid balance \nof $505 that was placed for collection in 2017. (Item 6, at 7) During his OPM interview, \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the account, but stated that he would make payment \narrangements if he determines that he owes the debt. (Item 7, at 8) In his Answer to the \nSOR, he denied that he owed any money on the account and contended that he was a \ncurrent customer and he was current on his bill. He did not assert that any payments had \nalready been made by him. (Item 2) He failed to submit any documents associated with \nthe account, such as a monthly statement, receipts, cancelled checks, bank statements, \nor credit card statements to support his contentions. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, it is impossible to determine if the account has been resolved. The \naccount remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to a charge account with an unpaid balance of $2,890 that was \nplaced for collection in 2010 and eventually charged off. (Item 6, at 8) During his OPM \ninterview, Applicant denied any knowledge of the account, but stated that he would make \npayment arrangements if he determines that he owes the debt. (Item 7, at 8) In his \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nAnswer, Applicant admitted the allegation, offering no excuse, but added that he was \nworking on payments. (Item 2) As of the date the record closed, he did not assert that any \npayments had already been made by him. The account remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. refers to an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $1,227 that was \nplaced for collection in 2013 and eventually charged off. (Item 6, at 8) During his OPM \ninterview, Applicant acknowledged that he had borrowed $6,500 and paid the balance \ndown to about $1,200 when he began experiencing financial hardships. He did nothing \nuntil 2014 when he claimed he approached the creditor to make payments, but when he \nwas informed that the account had been charged off, he took no further action until 2017 \nwhen he received a telephone call from a collection agent. (Item 7, at 8) He paid the \ncharged-off account in full on December 7, 2017, over a year and one-half before the \nSOR was issued. (Letter, dated October 4, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) \nThe account has been resolved.  \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2014, 2015, 2017, \nand 2018, and he had seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $21,417. He \nclaimed that his failure to timely file the federal income tax returns was because he didn\u2019t \nhave the necessary documents to enable him to do so, and he had insufficient funds to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status. As of the date the SOR was issued, he had \nresolved only two of those delinquent accounts, with one of those resolutions occurring \nnearly two months after the SOR was issued. He failed to provide documentary proof \nregarding the dates he finally filed his federal income tax returns, but it is clear that he did \nnot do so until after the SOR was issued. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) The individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, as well as his failure to timely file his federal income tax returns for four \ndifferent tax years, cause me to conclude that his financial problems were not infrequent \nand they are likely to continue in the future. He attributed his financial difficulties to \ncontractors who were not paying him in a timely manner to enable him to maintain his \naccounts in a current status; he was too busy to file his income tax returns; and his inability \nto obtain necessary tax information to enable him to file his income tax returns.  \nAs noted above, the first document\u2013supported activity between Applicant and a \ncreditor took place on or about December 7, 2017, over a year and one-half before the \nSOR was issued. The only other document\u2013supported payment to a creditor occurred on \nOctober 24, 2019, nearly two months after the SOR was issued. As of the date the record \nclosed, he did not assert that other payments had already been made by him to any other \ncreditor. He did claim that he had finally filed his delinquent federal income tax returns \njust weeks before that date. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems \nonly after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be \nlacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or \nwhen there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. \n18, 2018). In this instance, Applicant completed his most recent SF 86 in December 2016; \nunderwent his OPM interview in November 2017; completed his answers to the \ninterrogatories in May 2019; and the SOR was issued in August 2019. Each step of the \nsecurity clearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the financial \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nissues confronting him. With the one exception related to his resolution of a debt for \n$1,227 well before the SOR was issued \u2013 a fact that should have been caught by a more \nthorough OPM investigation and a credit report more recent than 2017 \u2013 there is no \nverified evidence that Applicant took any steps to engage his various creditors before the \nSOR was issued. With respect to his unfiled 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 federal income \ntax returns, there is no evidence that Applicant took any action to contact the IRS until \nwell after those tax returns were required to be filed. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)). In this instance, with that one noted exception, there is no evidence, \nsupported by documentation, that Applicant took any good-faith corrective actions with \nrespect to his delinquent debts, including his delinquent federal income taxes, before the \nSOR was issued. There are some unverified comments by Applicant that he started to \nresolve some delinquent accounts after the SOR was issued, but he offered no \ndocumentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding the status of some \naccounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions, without \ndocuments, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The Appeal \nBoard has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. He is \nreported to be a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor, but in February 2020, he \nself-reported that he is a full-time employee with a locks and locksmith security company. \nHe has also been self-employed as the owner of a technical company where he has \nworked part-time since March 2013. With the exception of one relatively brief period of \nunemployment from October 2011, when he was terminated from a position, until January \n2012, he served in a variety of full-time positions with various other companies since April \n2006. He attended a community college for two years, and he earned some college \ncredits, but no degree. He was granted eligibility for either a security clearance or a \nposition of public trust in August 2013. He addressed one of his creditors well before the \nSOR was issued, resolved another minimal account (for $219) after the SOR was issued, \nand finally filed his delinquent multi-year federal income tax returns in 2020. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. In addition to his failures to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018, Applicant had seven delinquent accounts, \nincluding unpaid federal income taxes, totaling approximately $21,417, as alleged in the \nSOR. As of the date the record closed, he had resolved only two of those delinquent \naccounts, and he failed to provide documentary proof regarding the dates he finally filed \nhis federal income tax returns, or if he had installment agreements with the IRS with \nrespect to his unpaid federal income taxes.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s unverified claims regarding his delinquent debts and his \nfailures to timely file his multi-year federal income tax returns, with the exception of two \naccounts \u2013 one in 2017 and one in 2019 \u2013 there is very little documentary evidence to \nindicate that Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts have been addressed. Applicant\u2019s current \ntrack record is poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/28/2020 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. His delinquent debts (three medical collection \naccounts) are due to uninsured medical expenses after suffering serious injuries in an \nautomobile accident. He is making a reasonable and good-faith effort to resolve his \nindebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of financial problems. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 11, 2018. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application.

He admitted the factual \nallegations, and he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 30, 2019. The hearing took place \nas scheduled on December 2, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-E. Other than \nApplicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 11, 2019. \nThe record was kept open until December 31, 2019, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to submit additional documentation. He made a timely submission, and the \nadditional documents (along with the e-mail correspondence) are admitted without \nobjections as Exhibits F-J. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. (Tr. 5-6) He works as a plumber\u2019s apprentice for a large \ncompany in the defense industry. He has worked for this company since September \n2018. He was hired as a custodian before the company placed him into the plumber \napprenticeship program. He has a good employment record with his current job. \n(Exhibits B and D) Before that, he had a part-time job from April 2010 to about \nDecember 2018. He worked both the full-time and part-time jobs for the last several \nmonths of 2018. He earned a high school diploma in 2000. He has been attending a \ncommunity college for his current employment, for which he is reimbursed for tuition by \nhis employer. (Exhibit I at 5) He obtained a commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL), and he is \ntaking classes for his apprenticeship. (Exhibit J) He has never married and has no \nchildren. \nApplicant earns $15.86 per hour as a plumber\u2019s apprentice. (Exhibit I at 5) He \nexpects his wages to increase as he progresses through the apprenticeship over three \nto four years. (Tr. 37-38) His total wages in 2018 were $26,540 per his 2018 federal \nincome tax return; his taxable income was $15,325. (Exhibit I at 19) A written budget \nreflects a positive net monthly remainder of about $150. (Exhibit I at 2-4) He described \nhis financial situation as living paycheck-to-paycheck. (Tr. 41-42) \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2-5) The SOR concerns three medical collection \naccounts in the amounts of $50,109, $1,538, and $333 held by three different creditors. \nThe three medical collection accounts are reflected in the October 2018 credit report. \n(Exhibit 3) The largest of the debts is reflected in all three credit reports, October 2018, \nSeptember 2019, and November 2019. (Exhibits 3, 4, and 5) The two smaller debts do \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \nnot appear in the 2019 credit reports. (Exhibits 4 and 5) Other than the three medical \ncollection accounts, the credit reports do not reflect any unfavorable financial \ninformation. \nApplicant explained the indebtedness stems from uninsured medical expenses \nhe incurred due to serious injuries he suffered in July 2013, when he was involved in a \nsingle-car accident caused by a flat tire and a vehicle rollover. (Tr. 28-29; Exhibit A) He \nwas traveling from his state of residence to his former state of residence to see his \nfather who was dying from cancer; his father passed shortly before the accident. \nApplicant suffered a cracked sternum, fractured ribs, a compound fracture of his left \nankle, and a popped blood vessel in an eye. (Exhibit A) He was taken to a major \nhospital by medivac helicopter. He was uninsured at the time because as a part-time \nemployee he was ineligible for his employer\u2019s health-insurance plan. He was out-of-\nwork from his part-time job from about July 11, 2013, to December 2, 2013, but \nmanaged to get by with assistance from his employer, family, and friends. (Tr. 29; \nExhibit A) \nApplicant was unaware of the three medical collection accounts until he was \nconfronted about them during the March 2019 background investigation. (Tr. 33; Exhibit \n2) He paid in full the $333 medical collection account in December 2019. (Exhibit G) He \nmade a repayment arrangement with the creditor for the $1,538 medical collection \naccount; he has been paying $60 monthly since September 2019; and the balance was \n$1,257 as of December 2019. (Exhibit H) He applied in writing to have the $50,109 \nmedical collection account cancelled, forgiven, or reduced based on hardship or charity. \n(Exhibit I) He applied the first time in August 2019, but had to resubmit the application in \nSeptember 2019.  \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4  \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to \nuninsured medical expenses he incurred for medical care and treatment of his serious \ninjuries suffered in the 2013 car accident. Once he became aware of the three medical \ncollection accounts, he acted responsibly under the circumstances by taking remedial \nactions to resolve the debts. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve the medical collection accounts. \nHe paid off one account, and he is making $60 monthly installment payments on \nanother account. The medical collection account for more than $50,000 is clearly \nbeyond his ability to repay, now and in the foreseeable future. So, he has taken a \nreasonable course of action by seeking to have the creditor either forgive, cancel, or \nreduce it to an amount he can realistically repay. He receives credit for taking these \nactions, which are well documented. (Exhibits F-I) Given the circumstances, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all \nhuman affairs, perfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially \nresponsible and resolve his indebtedness. There are indications that his financial \nproblems are under control. His overall financial situation is stable, as shown by the \ncredit reports that show no unfavorable financial information other than the three \nmedical collection accounts. It is probable that he will continue to make progress in \nresolving the two outstanding medical collection accounts. Taking everything into \naccount, the financial considerations concern is mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant his eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

On \nOctober 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec.

On July 15, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 10, \n2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of two \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through M, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant previously had appended 12 exhibits to his answer to the \nSOR, which were marked as Applicant\u2019s Answer Exhibits (AAX) A through L and admitted \nwithout objection.  \nI kept the record open to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary \nevidence and to allow the parties to enter into a stipulation of the medical conditions of \nApplicant, his wife, and their daughter. Applicant timely submitted AX AA, BB, and CC, \nwhich were admitted without objection.

The parties also entered into a joint stipulation of medical conditions, which \nwas admitted as AX DD. The record closed on October 25, 2020.

Department Counsel did not object to the amendment and \nconceded that the debt was paid. (Tr. 13-14.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old program manager employed by federal contractors since \nOctober 2011. He was cleared for a public trust position by another federal agency, but \nhe has never held a security clearance. (GX 1 at 28; AAX I at 2.) \nApplicant married in July 1994 and divorced in October 2000. He married his \ncurrent wife in August 2001. He has three children from his first marriage, ages 25, 23, \nand 21, and a 16-year-old daughter from his current marriage. \nApplicant\u2019s wife worked in the private sector, was laid off for about six months, and \nthen was hired as a software programmer for a federal agency in December 2002.

The payments were about $442 and \n$227 per month until they were consolidated a \u201cfew years ago.\u201d (Tr. 59.) Her student-loan \ndebt is about $178,000. (AAX E.) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife was hired in December 2002, Applicant had been \nunemployed for about a year. (Tr. 66.)

(Tr. 67.) \nIn August 2010, Applicant\u2019s wife accepted a federal position in another state that required \na security clearance, which she received. Her new job increased her annual pay from \n$57,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 72-73.) In 2018, she was hired by a defense contractor for her \ncurrent job as the director of cybersecurity. (AAX E.) \nApplicant\u2019s 16-year-old daughter has asthma and severe allergies. She requires \ndaily medication. Her asthma places her at a higher risk of allergic reactions. Her asthma \ncan be triggered by cigarettes, dust, mold, plants, pets, wood smoke, peanuts, and tree \nnuts. She requires an immediate injection of epinephrine upon display of allergic \nsymptoms. Her allergies are is so severe that exposure to them in an enclosed space can \ncause her to go into anaphylactic shock. (AX BB.) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter is now enrolled in a private school, and she has an \nindividualized education plan that can accommodate her special needs. (AX I; Tr. 83-84.) \nApplicant and his wife incur continuing tuition expenses, expenses for special equipment, \nand the expenses of modifications to their home to accommodate her medical needs. (Tr. \n85-86; AX BB; AX DD.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife has an inherited genetic mutation that causes multiple pulmonary \nembolisms and venous thrombosis. She had two miscarriages before their 16-year-old \ndaughter was born in 2004, and she was on bed rest for 14 weeks after childbirth. (Tr. \n64.) While Applicant\u2019s wife was pregnant, Applicant had medical conditions that required \nsurgery on three occasions, including emergency surgery for kidney failure caused by \nkidney stones. (Tr. 64.) \nIn September 2004, Applicant and his wife filed a joint petition for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. It was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2005, and a discharge \nwas granted in July 2005. (GX 6.) Seventeen debts totaling about $49,271 were \ndischarged. The debts were for lawn service ($80); two unsecured loans ($295 and $740); \nschool tuition for their daughter ($587); three medical debts ($572, $2,680, and $864); \nfive credit cards ($539, $618, $553, $553, and $2,317); two car loans ($17,278 and \n$20,294); two debts to a moving company ($580 each); and state taxes ($136). This \nbankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nBased on a pediatrician\u2019s advice, Applicant was voluntarily unemployed from July \n2005 to October 2011 to stay home and care for their daughter and homeschool her. (Tr. \n62.) He worked in intermittent construction jobs on weekends or when his wife was at \nhome. (Tr. 70.) He attended college classes on line and on weekends from 2002 to 2008, \nand he incurred student loans to pay for his classes. (Tr. 72.) \nIn September 2010, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law moved in with them because his \nfather-in-law had serious health problems and they were unable to make their mortgage \npayments. His in-laws lived with them for two years, during which time Applicant and his \nwife paid all their living expenses.

He left this job in August 2012 for what he considered a better position with \nhis current employer, also a federal contractor. His current financial problems were \ntriggered in December 2012, when his former employer sued him for violation of the non-\ncompete provisions in his contract, seeking $2.5 million in damages and injunctive relief. \n(AX C.) The lawsuit was vigorously contested by Applicant and his new employer, who \nvoluntarily paid more than $80,000 of Applicant\u2019s legal expenses. (AX D-G; Tr. 105.) \nIn January 2013, Applicant was informed by his new employer that the payment of \nlegal expenses was a bonus, for which no federal or state taxes were withheld. As a \nresult, Applicant\u2019s taxable income was increased from around $190,000 to $285,000. (Tr. \n114; AX H; AX M.) \nIn February 2013, Applicant filed a demurrer to his former employer\u2019s complaint, \nasserting that the complaint was based on an unenforceable non-compete agreement. \n(AX E.) In May 2013, the court granted the demurrer in part. (AX G.) In October 2013, \nApplicant filed a motion for summary judgment. (AX F.) Shortly thereafter, his former \nemployer accepted an offer to settle the lawsuit for $40,000. \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015. (GX 5.) This \nbankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. This petition and all subsequent bankruptcy petitions \nwere filed by Applicant as the sole debtor. This petition listed one secured debt for a car \nloan with an unpaid balance of $25,328; an unsecured priority debt for $58,000 to the \nIRS; and $220,876 in unsecured nonpriority debts, all of which were student loans, except \nfor two credit-card accounts with balances of $1,773 and $3,400. The May 2019 credit \nreport (GX 7) reflects that all of Applicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent between \nDecember 2013 and February 2014. The petition was dismissed in March 2016 after \nconfirmation of his plan was denied, because his unsecured debts exceeded the \nmaximum allowed in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 23.) \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2016. (GX 4.) This \nbankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. In this petition, he listed a tax debt of $3,575 to the \nstate where he resided from August 2010 to September 2014; a federal income tax \npenalty of $5,845; a federal income tax debt of $89,937 for tax years 2012 through 2014; \nstudent loans totaling $372,789; and other nonpriority unsecured debts totaling $110,502. \nSix of the nonpriority unsecured debts were listed as disputed, including two large debts \nfor $16,228 and $45,290, but the bases for the disputes are not reflected in the record. In \nJanuary 2017, he requested that the case be dismissed because the maximum dollar \namount of unsecured debts permitted in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy had been increased, \nand he had paid down some of his unsecured debts. (Tr. 24.) \nIn 2017, Applicant was diagnosed with a blood deficiency and suffered two \npulmonary embolisms. He also underwent multiple gallbladder surgeries. (AAX E.) He \ncontinued to work full time in spite of his medical problems. In November 2017, his wife \nwas granted workplace accommodations that include telework, an air filtration machine \nin her office, no air travel, and \u201cmaxiflex\u201d work schedules.

(AX J.) In July 2018, he made a payment agreement with the IRS for tax year 2013, \nand he began making monthly payments of $1,310 per month. His total payments for tax \nyear 2013 were $11,790. He made no payments for tax years 2014, 2015, or 2016. His \nfederal tax debt as of July 2019 was $130,324. (AAX D.) He testified that in 2019, the IRS \nterminated his payment plan because his tax debt was more than the $100,000 limit on \npayment plans. (Tr. 110-11, 126.) He has not made any further payments on his federal \ntax debt since his payment plan was terminated. His federal tax debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. \nApplicant did not timely file his state income tax returns for 2014 and 2015. A state \ntax debt of $8,802 to his former state of residence is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In his answer \nto the SOR, he stated that his tax debt to his previous state of residence was included in \nhis most recent bankruptcy petition. However, the only state tax debt in his January 2020 \npetition is a debt to his current state of residence, which is not alleged in the SOR. His \nanswer to the SOR included a statement from his wife stating that he was paying $550 \nper month on his delinquent state taxes. She did not state whether he was making \npayments to his current state of residence or his former state of residence. (AAX E.) \nApplicant has not provided any documentation of payments to either state. \nApplicant timely filed his federal returns for 2018 and 2019. He and his bankruptcy \nattorney testified that he is in the process of amending the returns for these two years in \nan effort to lower the amount of taxes due. (Tr. 114.) He and his wife had been filing \nseparate returns, which increased their total income tax obligation, in order to protect her \nincome from the lawsuit by his former employer. (Tr. 50-51.) As of the date the record \nclosed, Applicant had submitted no evidence that he had filed his amended federal \nincome tax returns. \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 2020. This \nbankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR. He listed a tax debt of $25,000 to the state where \nhe currently resides, a federal tax debt of $108,000, student loans totaling $262,594, and \nnonpriority unsecured debts of $7,875. He did not list the tax debt of $8,802 to the state \nwhere he resided from August 2010 to September 2014, which he admitted in his answer \nto the SOR. He did not list any medical debts, but in his post-hearing submission he \nprovided documentation of family medical expenses totaling about $54,352, incurred \nbetween May 2018 and September 2020. (AX CC; AX DD.) This bankruptcy petition was \ndismissed in July 2020 at Applicant\u2019s request, when he discovered that his payments on \nthe mortgage loan for their home, which was not included in the bankruptcy, would have \nmade his monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee more than he felt he could afford. \nHis listing of monthly expenses in his petition reflected monthly payments on the first \nmortgage on their home of $3,100 and monthly payments of $800 on an additional \nmortgage. (GX 3; Tr. 26.) \nApplicant refiled his petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2020, and it was \npending at the time of the hearing. (GX 2.) This petition was not alleged in the original \nSOR.

(Tr. 139.) (The additional \nallegation was mistakenly referred to as SOR \u00b6 1.y at the hearing.) As of the date of the \nhearing, Applicant had not filed Schedules E and F (unsecured claims), because he \nhoped that filing amended federal income tax returns jointly instead of separately would \nreduce the amount of delinquent federal taxes included in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 42-43.) As \nof the date the record closed, Applicant had submitted no evidence that he had completed \nhis bankruptcy petition by filing Schedules E and F. \n \nIn the August 2020 bankruptcy petition, Applicant and his wife reported monthly \nincome of $20,822.39 and a net remainder after paying monthly expenses of $3,554.39, \nwhich will be his monthly payment if the plan is approved. (Tr. 27.) Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy \nattorney testified that the monthly payment to the trustee would require Applicant and his \nfamily to \u201clive tight\u201d during the period of the bankruptcy plan, because they would be \nrequired to dedicate almost all of their disposable income to the bankruptcy plan. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly payments on the home mortgage loan (reported in his January 2020 \npetition as $3,100 on the first mortgage and $800 on an additional mortgage) and car \npayments (reported in the January 2020 petition as $829 and $771 for two cars) are not \nincluded in the proposed plan, because Applicant intends to keep the family home and \ntheir cars. (Tr. 31.)  \nApplicant has completed the financial counseling required by the bankruptcy court. \n(Tr. 35-36.) He maintains a spreadsheet of family income and expenses, and he updates \nit weekly. (Tr. 118-19.) His current annual salary is about $190,000. (Tr. 128.) He and his \nwife have a combined annual income of more than $400,000. (Tr. 131.) He testified that \nhe has increased the tax withholding from his pay and included the increased withholding \nin calculating his ability to comply with a Chapter 13 payment plan. (Tr. 132.) \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filings alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.x and \nthe federal and state tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, the SOR alleges 18 \ndelinquent debts totaling about $408,827. The evidence concerning these debts is \nsummarized below. \n6 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o-1.w: delinquent student loans totaling about \n$373,763. Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans are reflected in a M\n \nay 2019 credit report. \n(GX 7.) All the student loans were included in the January 2020 bankruptcy petition. \nAlthough most student loans are not discharged in bankruptcy, Applicant is counting on \nthe likelihood that some of the student loans are private loans that may not be not \nenforceable because the statutes of limitation have run. (Tr. 29-30.) He submitted no \nevidence of any payments or other resolution of the delinquent student loans. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: judgment for $7,020. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted \nthis judgment but stated that he was unable to identify the original creditor. However, in \nhis Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, he identified the original creditor. (GX 4 at 9, 18.) He \nalso stated that the debt was disputed, but he did not state the basis for the dispute. The \njudgment is not reflected in the credit report from May 2019 or the two credit reports \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted by Applicant.

It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: payments on settlement agreement past due for $3,360. After the \nlawsuit filed by Applicant\u2019s former employer for violation of a non-compete law was settled \nfor $40,000, Applicant made an immediate payment of $30,000 and agreed to pay $250 \nper month toward the balance of $10,000. For about a year and a half, he made his \npayments in cash by making counter deposits to the former employer\u2019s bank account. He \ndiscontinued his payments when the bank would no longer accept the counter deposits. \nHe testified that, in spite of several inquiries, the former employer has not provided any \nnew instructions for making the payments. (Tr. 106-08.) This debt is not reflected in the \nMay 2019 credit report (GX 7), but Applicant admitted it in his answer to the SOR. It was \nincluded in the March 2016 bankruptcy petition, but it was not included in January 2020 \nbankruptcy petition. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: past due car payments totaling $24,684. This debt arose when \nApplicant stopped making payments to a third-party loan servicer and surrendered the \nvehicle, which was sold. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the loan servicer \ntold him in 2016 that the account was settled. The May 2019 credit report lists the account \nas a \u201cclosed or paid account\u201d with a zero balance. (GX 7 at 5.) A credit report from \nSeptember 2020 reflects that the account is current with a zero balance. (AX A at 39.) \nAnother credit report from September 2020 reflects that the debt was \u201cpaid satisfactorily \nand is closed. (AX B.) Department Counsel conceded that the debt was resolved in 2013. \n(Tr. 13-14.) \nApplicant has received top ratings from his current employer for the past five years. \n(AX K.) The Chief Operating Officer for his current employer considers him highly skilled, \nreliable, credible, and devoted to his family. (AX L at 1-2.) A retired member of the Senior \nExecutive Service has known Applicant for more than seven years and considers him \ntrustworthy, loyal, and reliable. (AX L at 4-5.) A personal friend, who is a retired Air Force \nofficer, has known Applicant since 2014 and believes he is patriotic, devoted to his job, \nand dedicated to his family. (AX L at 6-7.) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s immediate subordinates, who holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in \neconomics and a law degree, submitted a letter supporting Applicant. She considers \nApplicant one of their employer\u2019s most effective leaders and committed supporters. She \ndescribes him as a warm, welcoming, charismatic, helpful, and effective leader. She \nconsiders him faithful, trustworthy, and a person of integrity. She has witnessed his \ndevotion to his family. She has observed that his consistency and unwavering support of \nhis team has garnered staff loyalty, respect, and dedication. As a subordinate, she feels \nvalued and appreciated by Applicant. (AAX I.) \nA coworker, who served in the U.S. Air Force for 23 years, has known Applicant \nfor three years, and has had a personal friendship with him for one year.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation.

May 1, 2012). \nI have considered whether the bankruptcies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.x \nduplicate the allegations of delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.w. When the same conduct \nis alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). \n \nWhile there is considerable overlap between the bankruptcies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.c with the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.w, the bankruptcy petitions alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c included debts not alleged in the SOR. The most recent bankruptcy \npetition is incomplete, making it impossible to determine the extent of duplication, if any. \nAccordingly, I have not resolved any of the alleged debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.w in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor as duplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, or 1.x.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted by the parties \nestablishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which is \nmitigated by the passage of time. There is no evidence that Applicant experienced \nfinancial problems after his 2005 bankruptcy discharge until 2013, when he was \nconfronted with an unexpected lawsuit and the tax consequences of his new employer\u2019s \ndecision to compensate him for his legal expenses. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established for the bankruptcies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \nand 1.x and the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.w, because they were triggered \nunder circumstances making recurrence unlikely, i.e. an unexpected lawsuit and \nunanticipated tax consequences of a \u201cbonus\u201d to offset legal expenses. Nevertheless, \nApplicant\u2019s growing federal tax debt, unresolved student loans, and minimal progress in \n10 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolving his other debts over a period of five years raises doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. The medical problems, medical debts, lawsuit, \ntax consequences of Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s financial assistance with the costs of \nlitigation, and the debt incurred to settle the lawsuit were conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol. He acted responsibly regarding settlement of the lawsuit and payment of his \nmedical debts. However, he has not acted responsibly regarding his federal and state tax \ndebts and his delinquent student loans. His federal tax debt increased by $35,499 in tax \nyear 2014; $25,416 in tax year 2015; and $22,738 in tax year 2016, indicating that he did \nnot take measures to avoid going deeper in debt, such as increasing payroll withholding \nor making quarterly payments on estimated taxes. He did not begin making payments on \nhis 2013 federal taxes until July 2018. His current plan to utilize bankruptcy has not \nprogressed sufficiently to mitigate security concerns. He has no current plan to resolve \nhis delinquent federal and state taxes. He has no current plan to resolve his student loans, \nexcept to hope that some of the private loans are barred by a statute of limitations.  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Although Applicant has received financial \ncounseling, his financial problems are not under control. He is relying on the bankruptcy \nprocess to bring them under control, but he filed his most recent bankruptcy petition in \nAugust 2020 and does not yet have an approved payment plan. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are not established. Applicant does not have payment plans \nin effect for his debts, including his tax debts. He receives some mitigation credit for \nreducing some of his nonpriority unsecured debts between the time he filed his Chapter \n11 petition in March 2016, dismissed it in January 2017, and filed his Chapter 13 petition \nin January 2020, but he submitted no evidence that he had completed his August 2020 \npetition as of the date the record closed. He has no current bankruptcy plan in effect. He \nhopes that collection of some of his private student loans may be barred by the statute of \nlimitations, but reliance upon a statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort \nto resolve that debt within the meaning of the Directive. ISCR Case No. 07-06841 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008). See ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May 2, 2013). \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09\u00ad\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). After \nmore than five years, Applicant is still searching for a plan. He has not articulated with \nany specificity how he intends to address his tax debts, delinquent student loans, and the \nremaining nonpriority unsecured debts totaling about $7,875. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors, co-workers, and friends. He and \nhis family have encountered numerous financial, personal, legal, and medical difficulties. \nHe was candid and sincere at the hearing. He and his wife acted responsibly in \nSeptember 2004 by filing a joint bankruptcy petition. However, Applicant has filed \nsubsequent bankruptcy petitions as a sole debtor in March 2015, March 2016, January \n2020, and August 2020, and he still does not have an approved payment plan. Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy attorney acknowledged that if his most recent bankruptcy petition results in \nan approved payment plan, he will need to be on tight budget to comply with it. Except \nfor the short time when Applicant had a payment plan with the IRS, he has never \nestablished a track record of complying with a payment plan, and it is too soon to \ndetermine whether he has the financial discipline to do so. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.m, and 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.l and 1.o-1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On August 28, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. (Item 1.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \ndated June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 5, 2019. He admitted the three SOR \nallegations, with explanations. He requested that his case be decided by an \nadministrative judge on the written record without a hearing. On November 8, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), containing three Items was provided to Applicant. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM.  \n \n \nApplicant responded to the FORM in an undated submission, received by DOHA \non September 12, 2019. He did not object to Items 1 through 3.1 Applicant also \nsubmitted additional information in his FORM response, to which Department Counsel \nhad no objection. DOHA assigned the case to me on January 21, 2020. Items 1 through \n3 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is marked as exhibit \n(AppX) A and is also admitted.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nIn the FORM, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Russia. Department Counsel provided an eight-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by a plethora of Government documents pertaining to Russia, identified \nas Item I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. (GX 2 at page 5.) He avers, \u201cI couldn\u2019t choose the \ncountry where I was born, my ancestors were exiled to Siberia from Poland and Estonia \nwhere they were fighting against the Russian Empire for freedom of their countries.\u201d \n(AppX A at page 1.) Applicant was previously married to a Russian women in Russia; \nbut is now married a second time to a native born American, and has two native born \nAmerican children. (AppX A at page 1.) In 1976, he attended a university in the then \nSoviet Union. (Id.) However, in 1991, nearly 30 years ago, he fled the Soviet Union, and \n\u201capplied for Political Asylum.\u201d (AppX A at page 2.) Applicant has worked for his \nemployer since February 2016.  (Item 2 at page 12.) \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that his father, sister and two children from a previous \nmarriage are citizens and residents of Russia. (GX 2 at pages 27~30, and 32.) (His \nmother died in 2018.) (GX 3 at page 3.) He last saw his father in 2004, about 16 years \nago. (AppX A at page 1.) He has little contact with his sister, who works at a beauty \nsalon (GX 2 at page 32, and GX 3 at page 14); and has not seen his children in \u201cmore \n                                                 \n1 As it appears that much of GX 3 is an \u201cEnhanced Subject Interview\u201d that was reviewed by Applicant, \nwith numerous pen and ink changes by him; it will be considered to be certified as accurate, and cited as \nevidence in this case.  \n  \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nthan 30 years,\u201d since his divorce in 1984. (GX 2 at pages 36~37, and AppX A at page \n1.) \n \n1.b. Applicant admits that he has two friends who are citizens and residents of \nRussia. However, he has little contact with them, one in 2014, and the other a former \ncoworker, in 2016. (GX 2 at pages 39~40.)  \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that he has two \u201cassociate(s)\u201d who are citizens and \nresidents of Russia, and who are also employed by the Russian government. One \nworks for the government \u201cas a Deputy Govenor (sic) for National Resources.\u201d (GX 3 at \npage 14.) He contacts this Deputy Governor \u201cvia Skype approximately 1 time every 1 to \n2 years,\u201d the last time being in 2017. (Id.) The other \u201cholds a high position with the IRS \nworking for the Russian government.\u201d (GX 3 at page 14.) He also contacts this Russian \nIRS official \u201cvia Skype approximately 1 time every 1 to 2 years,\u201d the last time being in \n2015. (Id.) These last two associates clearly pose the potential for improper foreign \ninfluence on Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Russia: Russia uses \ncyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making \nand benefit its economic interests. Russian intelligence services have conducted \nsophisticated and large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and \ntechnology information. Based on the eight pages summary offered by the Government, \nRussia appears to be a significant threat to our national security. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n \n  \nApplicant has relatives, friends and associates who are citizens and residents of \nRussia. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n                                                                                                                                    \nAs noted above in my Findings of Fact, Applicant\u2019s high-placed Russian \nassociates pose a significant Foreign Influence threat to our national security. Although \nhe Skypes them only about \u201c1 time every 1 to 2 years,\u201d the threat is clearly there. \nForeign Influence is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although Applicant has the full \nsupport of his American family and a close friend (AppX A at pages 3~6), overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \neligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He has not fully met his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Foreign Influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

(Tr. at 14-\n20, 22-24, 28-33, 39-46, 52-55; GE 1; AE H)   \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent consumer debts totaling $86,419 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.b). The debts are established by the 2016 and 2019 credit bureau reports. Applicant \nalso disclosed and discussed his debts in his 2016 security clearance application \n(SCA). (GE 1-3)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $73,299 charged-off home equity line of credit (HELOC). \nApplicant purchased a condominium in 2006. He obtained a first mortgage for $300,000 \nand a $75,000 HELOC, and his mortgage payments were $2,200 monthly. From 2006 \nto 2015, he was current on his first mortgage and this HELOC. When he moved in 2014, \nhe obtained renters for his home and supplemented the rental income he received with \nmoney from his retirement savings to make his mortgage payments from 2013 to 2015. \nHe began to fall behind on his mortgage in 2015. He telephoned the creditor and \nunsuccessfully attempted to reach a payment agreement. He then unsuccessfully \n\n \n3 \n \nattempted to short sell his condominium with his realtor\u2019s assistance from 2016 until it \nwas foreclosed and auctioned in around February 2017. He was not contacted by \nanyone concerning a deficiency balance on his first mortgage. He settled the HELOC \nfor $10,694, and paid it in December 2019.

He settled this debt for $7,380 and paid it \nin May 2019, before he began working for his current employer. (Tr. at 20-23, 25-28, 36, \n45, 51-52; GE 1; AE B, M) \n \n \nApplicant does not have any other delinquent debts. His annual salary since July \n2019 was $70,000, of which he allotted 8% into a retirement savings account. He lives \nfrugally. He rents a room for $750 monthly and his car is paid. His monthly net \nremainder after expenses is approximately $3,000 to $5,000. He has filed and paid his \ntaxes with the help of a tax advisor. He has not received financial counseling. He \nreceived several awards from the U.S. military, to include two Commendation Medals. \nCharacter references, to include two supervisors from 2005 to 2013 and his supervisor \nsince July 2019, attested to his outstanding performance and strong work ethic. They \nstated that they were aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and attested to his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  (Tr. at 19-21, 23-28, 37-38, 45-46, 52; AE D, \nF, G, K) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. \n  \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He credibly testified that he attempted to resolve the HELOC in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a when he began to fall behind on his mortgage in 2015. He also credibly testified that \nhe resolved both of his delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as soon as he \nrecovered from his medical issues in 2019. He paid SOR \u00b6 1.b before he began working \nfor his current employer in July 2019. He does not have any other delinquent debts. I \nfind that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

She worked for a defense contractor from December \n2017 until the end of May 2020. Her former employer plans to rehire her if she obtains a \nsecurity clearance. She is the single mother of a 16-year-old daughter. She dropped out \nof high school to care for her daughter and her gravely ill mother. She earned her high \nschool diploma in June 2017, and she is taking college classes. ((Tr.) at 15-18, 25-26; \nGE 1; AE D, E, G, J, O) \nApplicant was arrested in July 2008 and charged with simple assault, attempted \nthreats to do bodily harm, and attempted possession of a prohibited weapon. In \nSeptember 2008, the charges were dismissed for want of prosecution, which is defined \nas an \u201cinvoluntary dismissal accomplished on the Court\u2019s own motion for lack of \nprosecution or on motion from the defendant for lack of prosecution or failure to \nintroduce evidence of facts on which relief may be granted.\u201d (Tr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2; AE I) \nApplicant stated that she had an altercation at a night club with her friend, who \nwas her neighbor and was also sleeping with the father of Applicant\u2019s daughter. The \nfriend and others went to Applicant\u2019s home where the altercation escalated. Applicant \nstated that she picked up a knife in self-defense, but did not use it. She has not been \narrested or charged with any offense since those charges were dismissed. (Tr. at 27, \n41-42, 68-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant usually worked 80 hours per pay period in 2010. Her employer cut her \nhours to three days per week. This caused her to have difficulty paying her rent. The \nrental assistance office told her that she needed a letter from her supervisor explaining \nwhy her hours were cut. Her supervisor provided a letter but it did not state why the \nhours were cut. Rather than go back to her supervisor, Applicant changed the letter \nherself. Applicant told her supervisor, who stopped scheduling her for work, which was \nthe functional equivalent of a termination. (Tr.at 40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant lied on a job application in 2011 when she falsely reported that she had \na high school diploma. She received the job, but was terminated in November 2013 \nwhen her employer discovered the lie. (Tr. at 17; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which she attributed to \nunemployment and the costs of raising her daughter without the benefit of child support. \nThere has not been any significant unemployment since 2014. The SOR alleges unpaid \nfederal ($1,025) and state ($1,300) income taxes and 11 delinquent debts totaling about \n$17,400. Applicant admitted that she owed all the taxes and debts at one time. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE J) \nApplicant contracted a credit repair law firm in 2013, 2014, May 2019, and July \n2020. It is unclear if the law firm provided anything of value to Applicant. She also \nengaged the services of a debt-relief company in March 2019.

Under Schedule D, \nCreditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed a vehicle loan. Under Schedule \nE/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the petition did not list any priority claims. \nThe petition listed 25 nonpriority claims totaling $24,693. Applicant\u2019s debts were \ndischarged in March 2020. She completed credit counseling and financial management \ncourses as a requirement of her bankruptcy. (Tr. at 20-24; GE 3; AE A, C, Q, R) \nApplicant did not pay all of her federal and state income taxes when they were \ndue for tax years 2017 and 2018. In September 2019, she requested a $100 per month \ninstallment agreement from the IRS to pay $1,754 in back taxes. IRS records indicate \nthat she made $50 payments in August and September 2018, which were applied to her \n2017 taxes, and a $107 payment in November 2019, which was applied to her 2019 \ntaxes. She submitted proof from the IRS that she is current on all her taxes through tax \nyear 2019. (Tr. at 24-25, 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, S, T) \nApplicant entered into a payment plan with her state in July 2020 to pay $56 per \nmonth for 36 months for $1,794 in back taxes. She made a $50 payment on August 10, \n2020. (Tr. at 28-30; AE N, P) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nDecember 2017. She reported adverse information such as delinquent debts, that she \nwas denied a security clearance in 2012, and that she was fired in 2013 for lying about \nhaving a high school diploma. She reported that she had been attending an online \nuniversity since September 2017. She was accepted to that university in July 2017, but \nshe had never attended classes. She enrolled in a community college in the fall of 2017. \nShe credibly denied intentionally providing false information about her education. I find \nthat any misstatement on the SF 86 about Applicant\u2019s education was not due to an \nattempt on her part to mislead the DOD. (Tr. at 26, 39, 64-65; GE 1; AE E, F) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to her community \ninvolvement, moral character, and positive job performance. She is praised for her \npositivity, \ndedication, \ndependability, \ncompassion, \ntrustworthiness, \nselflessness, \nkindness, responsibility, honesty, work ethic, and integrity.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunpaid federal and state income taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment and the costs of \nraising her daughter as a single parent without the benefit of child support. Her daughter \nis 16 years old and the costs associated with caring for a teenager can be considerable, \nbut there has not been any significant unemployment since 2014. \nApplicant contracted with a debt-relief company in March 2019. She withdrew \nfrom the program after she did not see any results. She made $50 payments to the IRS \nin August and September 2018, which were applied to her 2017 taxes, and a $107 \npayment in November 2019, which was applied to her 2019 taxes. That indicates, and \nthe IRS verified, that she is current on her federal taxes. She entered into a $56 per \nmonth payment plan with her state in July 2020 to pay $1,794 in back taxes. She made \na $50 payment on August 10, 2020. Her dischargeable debts were discharged by the \nbankruptcy court in March 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay her taxes when required raises questions about her \njudgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. I found Applicant to be \nhonest and truthful, but unsophisticated when it comes to finances. With a security \nclearance, she will return to a good job. I am convinced that she has learned from the \nexperience and that her finances are sufficiently in order that security concerns about \nher finances are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.

SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for \nApplicant. \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s financial issues as personal conduct. It also \nalleges her criminal charges from 2008, and her dishonesty on a letter from her \nsupervisor in 2010 and on a job application in 2011. Her conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b) through 16(e) are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe financial aspects of Applicant\u2019s personal conduct are mitigated under the \nsame rationale addressed above under financial considerations. The remaining \nconduct, particularly the dishonesty, would be particularly concerning if it was more \nrecent. The latest conduct occurred in September 2011, essentially nine years ago \nwhen Applicant was 24 years old. She is now a 33-year-old single mother with all of the \nresponsibilities that entails. There is no evidence that the behavior has been repeated; \nshe has not been arrested or charged with anything since 2008; and she has good \ncharacter references. I find that the conduct is unlikely to recur; it does not cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; and it no longer \nserves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.

His financial \nproblems and his failure to file his income tax returns occurred under circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur. Information about his actions to address his debts and to resolve his \nincome tax deficiencies, combined with the strength of his current finances, is sufficient \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information. Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 8, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for a security clearance \nrequired for his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \n\n2 \ndetermine, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security clearance. \nOn July 31, 2019, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the current set \nof adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). With his \nresponse, he proffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 N. I received the case on November \n25, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing on January 28, 2020. The parties \nappeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February \n10, 2020. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 8. Applicant and \none witness testified. Applicant also proffered AX O \u2013 U. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection.  \nI held the record open after the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional \nrelevant information. The record closed on February 14, 2020, after I received Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submissions. They have been admitted without objection as AX V \u2013 X. Also \nincluded in this record are Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 (Index of Government Exhibits), HX 2 \n(Department Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated November 15, 2019), and HX 3 \n(Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions). \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file his federal \nincome tax returns on time for the 2010 \u2013 2017 tax years, and as a result, owes \n$23,120.61 in past-due taxes (SOR 1.a). It was also alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy petition in February 2013, declaring $188,638.02 in unsecured debts, and \nthat he was discharged of his debts in July 2013 (SOR 1.b). Finally, the Government \nalleged that Applicant had delinquent credit card debts of $2,739 (SOR 1.c) and $1,711 \n(SOR 1.d) to the same credit card company. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied \nwith explanations each of the allegations. (Answer; Tr. 10 \u2013 11)  \nApplicant\u2019s denials created issues of controverted fact as to SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d, and \nrequired the Government to produce sufficient reliable information to establish those \nallegations as facts. (Directive, E3.1.14) The information presented in GX 1 - 8 satisfied \nthat requirement and established those allegations as facts. In addition, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old and works in an information technology (IT) position for \na defense contractor. He was hired by his current employer in June 2019, and he has \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nworked in similar positions for defense contractors and for companies outside the defense \nindustry since December 1996. Applicant first received an industrial security clearance in \n2007. (Answer; GX 1; AX L) \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married from March \n1991 until 2004, when she abandoned the marriage, leaving him to raise their child (now \nage 26). Applicant remarried in May 2006, creating a blended family with his wife and her \ntwo children, now ages 25 and 28. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2) \n \n \nWhen he submitted his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed much of the adverse financial \ninformation addressed in the SOR. His financial problems began with the failure in 2011 \nof a small IT services business he had started in 2008. The business began as a part-\ntime venture at a time when his full-time defense contractor employment was unstable \ndue to government contract expirations and his employer\u2019s organizational changes. \nInitially, Applicant ran the business from his home and it became successful enough that \nhe relocated to a commercial space and hired additional employees. Unfortunately, \nstarting in about 2010, his business began to suffer as part of the national economic \ndownturn and he had to close the business in 2011. A subsequent partnership in a \nwoodworking business in 2012 also failed. Applicant had financed both businesses \nthrough the use of personal credit and he was unable to stay current on his repayment \nobligations when the business closed. As alleged in SOR 1.b, in February 2013, Applicant \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation of his debts, and he was discharged of his debts \nin July 2013. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; GX 5; AX E; Tr. 48 \u2013 49, 61) \n \n \nAfter July 2013, Applicant was beginning to recover financially when a series of \nunexpected expenses arose. In January 2013, as a result of his bankruptcy, Applicant \nand his family of five had to leave a house he had purchased in July 1991. They moved \ninto a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house that initially was big enough for all of them. \nLater in 2013, Applicant\u2019s grandfather, who lived about two hours away, became ill and \ncould not care for himself. Applicant was the nearest relative who could help his \ngrandfather and began traveling to see him on a regular basis. Applicant lost time and \nincome from work, and he bore the costs of some of his grandfather\u2019s medical expenses. \nAdditionally, because Applicant is legally blind and cannot drive, his wife also had to take \ntime off from work to drive him. In 2015, Applicant\u2019s grandfather was relocated to a nearby \nskilled nursing facility where he died three years later. (Answer; GX 3; AX O; Tr. 49 \u2013 51) \n \n \nAlso in 2013, Applicant\u2019s mother became ill and was hospitalized in an adjoining \nstate. After she was transferred to a hospital and recovery facility in Applicant\u2019s state, he \noften had to drive three hours to tend to her. Later that year, she moved in with Applicant \nand his family. As noted above, the house Applicant was renting at the time was large \nenough for his family of five when they moved in at the beginning of 2013. It quickly \nbecame too small to house six adults (Applicant\u2019s child and stepchildren were in their 20s \nby 2013). Applicant and his wife moved to a larger house that commanded a significantly \nhigher monthly rent. At this point, Applicant\u2019s wife had been unemployed for several years \nbecause of medical issues and Applicant was relying too much on credit cards to make \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nends meet. In 2016, Applicant and his family moved to a house with lower rent. His mother \nlived with him and his family until she died in 2017. Applicant\u2019s wife regained employment \nin 2014, and by 2018, Applicant\u2019s own employment had stabilized. He and his wife \nrecently qualified for mortgage financing and hope to buy a house in 2020. Applicant \nmeets all of his current obligations and estimates he has between $500 and $750 \nremaining each month after expenses, which include his IRS payments. (Answer; GX 3; \nHX 3; Tr. 54 \u2013 56) \n \n  \n \nApplicant did not file his income tax returns on time for the tax years 2011 through \n2017. In each year, he requested an extension of the April 15 filing deadline; however, he \nonly filed his 2011 returns before the extension expired. He did not file his federal returns \nfor 2012 through 2017 until December 2018. He filed his 2018 returns on time and, as of \nhis hearing, he expected to file his 2019 return by the end of February 2020. Applicant \ndid not file his returns as required because he was either personally overwhelmed by the \nstresses of his personal life or, more recently, he could not afford to pay an accountant to \ncompile and file his tax returns. As a result, Applicant owes in excess of $23,000 in unpaid \ntaxes. Applicant began taking action to file his returns and pay his past-due taxes in late \n2018. Once his returns were filed, his accountant negotiated a repayment plan with the \nIRS in May 2019. That effort was delayed by a federal government shutdown in December \n2018 and January 2019. Since July 2019, Applicant has paid $341 each month as \nrequired by the plan. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX V; Tr. 52 \u2013 53, 57 \u2013 61) \n \n \nApplicant also has resolved the debts alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.d. They were \ndelinquent credit card debts Applicant accrued in late 2015. He was able to resolve the \ndebt at SOR 1.c through settlement in January 2017. As to SOR 1.d, he had difficulty \ncommunicating with the collection agency that owned the account. In January 2020, he \nresolved the debt by paying a lesser amount agreed to by the creditor in a settlement \nagreement. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; GX 6 \u2013 8; AX F; AX G; AX N; AX P \u2013 R; AX X; Tr. 61 \u2013 \n64) \n \n \nApplicant has an excellent reputation with friends and co-workers. Information \nabout his performance at his last two employers reflects reliability, hard work, and \nprofessionalism. People who have known Applicant for most of the past 20 years feel he \nhas the requisite integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness to occupy a position of trust. A \nco-worker who has known Applicant since 1998 has personally observed Applicant as a \nsingle father who endeavors to act responsibly and who has always been reliable. (AX H \n\u2013 K, AX M; Tr. 44 \u2013 47) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531)  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nApplicant was discharged of his personal debts in 2013 through a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition. Thereafter, he became delinquent on two credit card accounts and \nhe failed to file or pay his federal income taxes between 2011 and 2017. This information \nreasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \n\u00b6 18: \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nBy contrast, available information shows that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy occurred as \na result of a failed small business in 2012, around the time of the national economic \ndownturn. As to his credit card debts, Applicant experienced a series of unexpected \npersonal challenges that adversely affected his finances; however, Applicant allowed \nthose personal challenges to distract him from his obligation to file his income tax returns \nfor several years. As soon as Applicant and his wife were able to stabilize their financial \nand personal circumstances, they began to work toward financial rehabilitation. In 2018, \nseveral months before the SOR was issued, Applicant acted to resolve his income tax \ndiscrepancies. All of his past-due returns have been filed and he has been making \npayments on his past-due taxes through a repayment plan agreed to with the IRS. He \nalso has resolved both credit card delinquencies and his current finances are sound. He \nand his wife have qualified for mortgage financing and are moving forward on the \npurchase of a house. Equally important is the stability in Applicant\u2019s personal life over the \npast three years, a circumstance that makes it unlikely he will experience similar financial \nproblems in the future. All of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 \nmitigating conditions: \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s information about his finances and tax \nreturns is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under this guideline. I also have \nevaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose, in part, from circumstances beyond his control. \nGenerally, a record of noncompliance with one\u2019s tax obligations indicates a significant \nproblem in one\u2019s judgment and reliability. It is clear that Applicant knew of his filing \nrequirements when they arose, as he requested filing extensions each year. By contrast, \nApplicant exercised good judgment by acting to resolve his tax and other financial \nproblems well before the SOR was issued. Applicant is unlikely to miss his tax obligations \nor to incur delinquent debts in the future. He also was candid and forthcoming throughout \nthe application, investigation, and adjudication of his request for a clearance. Further, he \nhas a solid reputation as a co-worker and friend among persons who have known him for \nmost of the past 20 years. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence \nas a whole shows that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns about his financial \nproblems. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n  For Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since February 2017. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He is single, with one child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 27, 38-39; GE 1) The SOR alleges a $16,400 medical account in collections and six miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $4,570. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing five of the debts, and he asserted the remaining two were paid. He attributed his financial problems to being a student, unemployment for about six months after college, and an auto accident in 2012. (Tr. at 21-23; GE 1, 2) Applicant was injured in 2012 while a passenger in a car accident. He did not have medical insurance at the time. The $16,400 medical account in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e) resulted from the medical bills associated with the accident. He thought the driver had auto insurance, but Applicant\u2019s medical expenses were not paid, so he may have been mistaken about the driver having insurance. Applicant called the medical provider and the collection company, and both told him that they did not have the debt. The debt is listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the June 2017 combined credit report. The activity date is March 2012. It is not listed on any subsequent credit report, most likely because it is beyond the seven-year reporting period. (Tr. at 22-25, 34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6;",

The case was assigned to other administrative \njudges on November 27, 2019, and December 17, 2019, and reassigned to me on \nJanuary 8, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 14, 2010. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were admitted \nwithout objection.  \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since February 2017. He is applying for a security clearance for \nthe first time. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He is single, with one child. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 27, 38-39; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a $16,400 medical account in collections and six miscellaneous \ndelinquent debts totaling $4,570. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing \nfive of the debts, and he asserted the remaining two were paid. He attributed his \nfinancial problems to being a student, unemployment for about six months after college, \nand an auto accident in 2012. (Tr. at 21-23; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant was injured in 2012 while a passenger in a car accident. He did not \nhave medical insurance at the time. The $16,400 medical account in collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) resulted from the medical bills associated with the accident. He thought the driver \nhad auto insurance, but Applicant\u2019s medical expenses were not paid, so he may have \nbeen mistaken about the driver having insurance. Applicant called the medical provider \nand the collection company, and both told him that they did not have the debt. The debt \nis listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the June 2017 combined credit report. \nThe activity date is March 2012. It is not listed on any subsequent credit report, most \nlikely because it is beyond the seven-year reporting period. (Tr. at 22-25, 34; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE G) \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $637 debt to a collection company on behalf of a \nfinancial institution (SOR \u00b6 1.f), asserting that the debt was paid in 2017. He provided \nproof in 2018, as part of his background investigation, that the debt and a non-alleged \n$722 debt to the same collection company on behalf of a different financial institution \nwere paid. All three credit reporting agencies listed the debts on the June 2017 \ncombined credit report. Neither debt is listed with a balance on any subsequent credit \nreport. (Tr. at 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5, 6; AE G) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation in his response to interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse, and at his hearing that the $634 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was paid in May \n2019. He testified that he paid the $214 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The debt was listed \nby Equifax and Experian on the June 2017 combined credit report, with an activity date \nof September 2015. The debt is not listed on the February 2019 Equifax credit report or \nthe January 2020 combined credit report. (Tr. at 33, 35-36; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2-6; AE B-D, F, G) \n \n \nApplicant paid $218 and $1,094 in January 2020 to resolve the $1,313 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He paid $300 and $941 the same month to resolve the $1,241 \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He paid $267, also in January 2020, to settle the $535 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. at 31-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE B-D, G) \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nTo summarize, Applicant started paying his debts well before the SOR was \nissued. He paid or settled all of the debts in the SOR, with the exception of the medical \ndebt. He also paid debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He has not received financial \ncounseling, but he is able to pay his current bills and not accrue any additional \ndelinquent debts. His January 2020 credit report lists the SOR debts that were recently \npaid. It does not list any other delinquent debts. (Tr. at 21-22, 25-26, 29-31, 36-38; GE \n2-6; AE E, G) \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his superior job performance. He is \npraised for his good character, reliability, responsibility, dependability, and integrity. (AE \nH, I) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n4 \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent consumer \ndebts and a medical debt after an auto accident. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being a student, unemployment \nwhile he was in college, and an auto accident in 2012. He started paying his debts well \nbefore the SOR was issued. All of the non-medical debts have been paid or settled. His \nmedical debt should have been paid by the driver\u2019s auto insurance, if the driver was \ninsured. In any event, that debt is about eight years old, no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport, and not being actively collected. His finances are now in order. He is able to pay \nhis current bills and not accrue any additional delinquent debts. \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant had a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. The above mitigating conditions are sufficiently \napplicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) on November 26, 2018, \nand December 2, 2009. On July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant answered (Answer) the SOR on August 12, 2019, and \nrequested a decision on the written record without a hearing.  \nOn October 17, 2019, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining six Items, was mailed to Applicant. He received the FORM on October 29, \n2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant responded to the FORM and submitted documentation. The case was \nassigned to me on December 4, 2019. I marked Applicant\u2019s documentation as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A. Items 1 through 6 and AE A are admitted into evidence without objection. \n\n \n \n2\nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He was married and divorced twice before 1995. He \nmarried his third (current) wife in 1995, and they separated in 2007. They have two \nchildren who are 20 and 22. After graduating from high school in 1976, Applicant enlisted \nin the U.S. Army, and he served on active duty until 1992.

(Item 3; Item 4) \n \nApplicant has been unemployed since November 2017, and supports himself with \nhis military retirement pay, savings, and disability pay. He worked as a mechanic for a \ndefense contractor in Iraq from January 2008 until November 2009. He then worked for \na defense contractor in Qatar until March 2017, when he returned to the United States. \n(Item 3; Item 4; Item 6) \n \nApplicant admitted in his November 2018 SCA that he had not filed his 2010 \nthrough 2017 state and federal income tax returns. He claimed he would file the 2017 \nreturns when he filed his 2018 returns.

However, he lived the majority of 2017 in the United \nStates and all of 2018 in the United States. He failed to file his 2017 and 2018 tax returns, \nas required. (Item 2; Item 6 at 3) \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his state and \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2017, as required. He also admitted \nthat he failed to file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2009 and 2018. \nApplicant submitted the first page of his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040s for \ntax years 2009 through 2018. Each 1040 was stamped as received by a local IRS office \non August 12, 2019. He did not include complete and signed copies of the tax returns, \nnor did he include any state income tax returns. (Item 2) \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant included an IRS transcript for tax year \n2010. The transcript reflects that the IRS sent Applicant notices three times between 2012 \nand November 2018. Applicant also submitted his complete state and federal tax filings \nfor tax years 2010 through 2018. These filings were all signed by Applicant on November \n8, 2019.

(Item 3 at 9-\n10; AE A at 38-39) \n \n\n \n \n3\nApplicant has not obtained credit counseling.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) outlines a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 19(f) in that Applicant failed to file his federal and \nstate income tax returns as required by law.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n \n5\nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 and 2017 in August \n2019, after the SOR was issued. Because he filed his state and federal income tax \nreturns, there is some evidence that AG \u00b6 20(g) is potentially applicable. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2009 and 2018 was not alleged in the SOR, and these tax years were not \nconsidered in determining if the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(f) was applicable. \nHowever, his failure to timely file his returns for tax years 2009 and 2018 demonstrates \nthat Applicant\u2019s tax issue is not mitigated  as it has been an ongoing problem for ten years, \nand this issue is not isolated, raising additional questions regarding his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nIn his SCA, PSI, and answers to the SOR and Forms Applicant provided discrepant \ninformation regarding his failure to file his tax returns. He provided a tax transcript for only \none year. Without transcripts for the additional years in question, it is difficult to determine \nif the tax returns were accepted and if Applicant owes money to the IRS due to penalties \nand interest that were the result of his failure to file his returns in a timely manner. He filed \nthe tax returns so recently that the IRS tax transcripts may not have been available when \nhe responded to the FORM. \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his taxes after the SOR was issued and after he \nreceived the FORM do not demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve his obligation to file \nstate and federal income tax returns. As a taxpayer, he had an affirmative obligation to \ncontact the IRS or research the requirement to file tax returns. His claim that he was \nunaware of his obligation to file the returns does not establish conditions that were beyond \nhis control, nor did he act responsibly to address his obligations in a timely manner. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) was not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n6\n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nThe record lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he is reliable, trustworthy, and \nexercises good judgment. His failure to file his tax returns until after the SOR was issued, \nis indicative that his motivation for filing was primarily the result of his desire to obtain or \nretain a security clearance. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United States to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 20, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 21, 2020, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on March 9, \n2020. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant submitted documents that were \nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K. There were no objections to any evidence \nand they are admitted. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. She married in 2004 and divorced in 2011. She has a \n12-year-old son from the marriage. She has cohabitated with her fianc\u00e9 since 2011. She \ndisclosed in her June 2018 security clearance application (SCA) that she was employed \nfrom August 2006 to October 2014; unemployed from October 2014 to August 2015; \nemployed from August 2015 to June 2016; unemployed from June 2016 to December \n2016; and employed from December 2016 to December 2017, when she began her \ncurrent employment with a federal contractor. (Items 3, 4)  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2018. She \nattributed her financial difficulties to her 2011 divorce, periods of unemployment, and \nmedical issues that began in 2011 and required surgery in 2014, which caused her to be \nout of work for several months under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). She \nindicated that she won a settlement from her employer for being terminated while on \nFMLA. She did not disclose the details of the settlement. (Item 4)  \n \nApplicant told the investigator that she had timely filed her 2014 federal income tax \nreturns and most of her tax debt was due to an early withdrawal of approximately $68,200 \nfrom her 401k retirement account. She had timely filed her 2015 and 2016 federal income \ntax returns without owing additional taxes. Her 2015 federal tax refund was applied to an \nunknown non-IRS debt.  \n \nIn response to Government interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that she owed \napproximately $7,868 to the IRS for tax year 2014 and that she had not timely filed her \n2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. She stated she filed her 2017 and 2018 federal \ntax returns late because she had moved. She also attributed her failure to timely file and \npay her federal and state income taxes to a lack of money as a result of her 2011 divorce, \nmedical issues, and job loss.  \n \nApplicant provided mail tracking numbers, presumably to show that she mailed her \n2017 federal and state tax returns on March 15, 2020. She provided a copy of her \nTurboTax balance sheet for 2017 for state and federal tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). \nShe filed her 2018 federal tax return approximately five months late, but did not owe \nadditional taxes. She provided documents to show she also filed her 2018 state tax return. \nIn addition, a document from the IRS from September 2019, noted that a state refund of \n\n \n3 \n \n \n$639 was seized and applied to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Items 2, 4; AE \nF, G, H, I, J) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated that she established a payment plan \nwith the IRS in September 2019, which was to begin in November 2019, whereby she \nwould make monthly payments of $300 towards her delinquent tax debt. In her response \nto the FORM, she provided documents to show she has been making the payments and \nher tax debt balance as of March 2020 was $6,150. (Item 2, AE A).  \n \n \n \nThe SOR debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s disclosures, admissions, and \ncredit reports from August 2018 and March 2019. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \n \nThe SOR alleged student loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($703), 1.n ($256) and 1.p \n($100). Applicant provided a document from March 2020 from the state where she \npreviously lived notifying her that a state tax refund of $702 was intercepted and applied \nto her delinquent student loans. She provided a document from the Department of \nEducation agreeing to accept a payment of $1,000 as settlement for her delinquent loans. \nApplicant wrote on the document that she had made three payments, the last in March \n2020 to settle the debt. She also provided confirmation numbers. (AE D, E)  \n \nApplicant provided a document dated August 2019, indicating her debt owed to the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,720) was paid in full. (AE C). \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in her SCA numerous medical debts from 2016 and indicated \nthey were \u201cpending payment\u201d, but she had taken no action to resolve them. During her \nbackground interview, she stated that she had numerous medical bills, some dating back \nto 2012. She was attempting to pay some smaller bills. Applicant did not provide any \nevidence regarding the status of the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($965), 1.g \n($814), 1.h ($710), 1.j ($560), 1.l ($470), and 1.o ($221). She did not provide any evidence \nregarding the status of the consumer debts owed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k ($526) and 1.m ($423). \n(Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 \nand 2018. She failed to timely pay her 2014 federal income taxes resulting in a delinquent \ntax debt. She has numerous other delinquent debts from at least 2016. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant admitted she owed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \nAlthough she has resolved some, she did not provide evidence of any action or plan to \nresolve the remaining debts. I am unable to conclude that financial problems are unlikely \nto recur and do not cast doubts on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to a 2011 divorce, periods of \nunemployment, and medical issues. These were conditions beyond her control. She \nattributed her failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns to a move, and \ninsufficient money to pay her taxes. Regardless of her ability to pay, Applicant\u2019s ability to \ntimely file her income tax returns was within her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. It has been nine years since Applicant\u2019s divorce, and she has been \nworking for her current employer since December 2017, more than two years. She did \nnot begin to take action on resolving her tax problems until after she was interviewed by \na government investigator in August 2018, and did not establish a plan to resolve them \nuntil September 2019. She paid some of her delinquent debts, but not until after she was \nconfronted with the debts during her background interview. She did not provide any \nevidence regarding her plan or payments for the numerous medical debts that remain \ndelinquent. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.  \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. Applicant provided proof that she paid her delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.i, 1.n, and 1.p), albeit one was paid after her state tax refund was intercepted and \napplied to the debt. She also paid the consumer debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \nthese debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s repayment plan with the IRS was confirmed in September 2019 and \nshe has been making payments since November 2019. She provided documents to show \nthat she mailed her delinquent 2017 federal and state tax returns in March 2020. It is \nunknown if they have been accepted and whether there are additional tax consequences. \nThere is evidence her 2018 federal and state tax returns are filed. There is sufficient \nevidence to conclude Applicant is in compliance with her payment agreement with the \nIRS. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. Her payment plan to resolve her federal 2014 tax debt, \nwas not implemented until September 2019, after she disclosed the debt during her \nAugust 2018 background investigation. Her failure to timely file federal and state income \ntax returns was not completed until March 2020.   \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \n \nIt appears that Applicant has now filed her delinquent tax returns, but her failure to \ndo so, as required and not until after she applied for a security clearance, remains a \nsecurity concern. Applicant also began resolving some of her other delinquent debts after \nshe completed her SCA. She has numerous debts that she has not provided evidence \nregarding her plans for resolving. Although there is evidence of some mitigation, Applicant \nfailed to establish a reliable financial track record and failed to meet her burden of \n\n \n8 \n \n \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.i:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He successfully mitigated the security concerns under Guidelines, E, \npersonal conduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 16, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines E, personal conduct, F, financial considerations, G, alcohol \nconsumption, and J, criminal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 8, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on December \n26, 2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant did not provide a \nresponse to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 26, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in \u00b6 3.a. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008. He is not married \nand has no children. He was employed from May 2008 to October 2013, with a private \ncompany. He then worked from October 2013 to July 2016, for a federal contractor. He \nleft this job because he was having difficulties with his alcohol use, and he voluntarily \nenrolled in an alcohol recovery program where he was a patient for one month. After his \ndischarge, he was unemployed for eight months before starting work with his current \nemployer in March 2017. (Items 2, 3, 4, 6) \n \nApplicant was arrested in March 2010 for possession of marijuana. He was on \nprobation for a year and completed a drug rehabilitation course. The charge was nolle \nprossed. During his August 2018 background interview, he told the government \ninvestigator that after his arrest he had no intention of being involved with illegal drugs \nagain. He made changes in his life and found more positive outlets for his time. There is \nno evidence of subsequent drug involvement. (Item 5, 7)  \n \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in August \n2012. The charge was nolle prossed. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents. \nApplicant continued to consume alcohol after his arrest, drinking four to six drinks a night. \nHe decided to address his alcohol consumption and voluntarily entered an alcohol \nrehabilitation program in July 2016. This coincided with him leaving his job and \nsubsequent unemployment. He was diagnosed by a medical doctor with alcohol abuse \ndisorder. He successfully completed the rehabilitation program. He indicated in his \nanswer to government interrogatories that he has not consumed alcohol since August \n2016. There is no evidence to the contrary. (Items 4, 5, 7) \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2017. \nSection 22 asked if he had ever been charged with an offense involving drugs or alcohol. \nApplicant failed to disclose his marijuana arrest and his DUI. In his SOR answer, he \nexplained that he misread the question believing it asked him if he had been convicted of \nthese type of offenses. I found his explanation credible and conclude he did not \nintentionally fail to disclose the requested information. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 29 delinquent debts totaling approximately $165,742. Applicant \nadmitted owing all of the debts. He was confronted with many of these debts during his \nbackground interviews. He indicated his willingness to pay his debts and attributed them \nto poor decisions he made when he was consuming alcohol. He was going to look into \nthe debts and work to resolve them. (Items 3, 4, 5, 8, 9) \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant began working with a law firm to help him dispute and \nsettle his delinquent debts. He provided a copy of the agreement and information included \nto show he had disputed certain debts that were removed from his credit report. He has \ndelinquent student loans that total approximately $117,598 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; this \namount is included in the overall delinquent debt balance). It appears he has two debts \nowed for vehicles (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-$12,848 and 1.n-$17,688); numerous medical debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-$8,051; 1.i-$351; 1.p-$720; 1.s-$409; 1.v-$132; 1.x-$92; 1.y-$80; 1.z-$80; 1.aa \n$65; 1.bb-$60 and 1.cc-$39); delinquent rent (SOR \u00b6 1.e-$2,218); and other consumer \nand payday loans. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8, 9) \n \nApplicant did not provide information that any of the alleged SOR debts have been \nsettled or paid. The document he provided showed that nine debts were removed, \npresumably from his credit report. Only one debt removed may possibly be included in \nthe SOR, but the only information noted is that the creditor is \u201cmedical.\u201d It does not specify \nthe amount of the medical debt or the collector. The other debts removed do not appear \nto be those included in the SOR. Applicant did not provide any evidence to identify if any \nother debts removed were alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any other information \nabout whether he has paid any of these debts, even the smallest ones. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8, \n9) \n \nDuring his background interview, Applicant indicated that his finances were stable, \nand he was working to better manage them. He did not provide a budget or any other \ninformation about his finances or any proof that he has paid or settled any of his \ndelinquent debts. Applicant received his college degree in 2008. He provided no \nexplanation for his failure to make payments on his student loans when due and while he \nwas employed. He indicated to the government investigator that he was making \narrangements to pay his student loans. He did not provide evidence that he has done so. \n(Items 4, 5) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts and student loans that have not been paid or \nresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nApplicant admitted he owed all of the debts alleged in the SOR. He contracted with \na law firm in June 2019, but there is no indication that any of the SOR debts have been \nresolved or paid, even the smallest ones. There is no evidence he has a payment plan to \nresolve his delinquent students loans. Although he was employed after graduating from \ncollege, except for eight months, he did not provide evidence that he has made payments \non his student loans. The evidence does not support that his debts were beyond his \ncontrol. He did not provide evidence that he has had financial counseling. There is no \nevidence that he has made good-faith efforts to repay or resolve his debts. The evidence \nis insufficient to conclude that future financial issue are unlikely to recur. None of the \nabove mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand  \n \n(d) Diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician . . .) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 2012. In 2016, on his own volition, he voluntarily \nentered an alcohol rehabilitation program and was diagnosed by a medical doctor with \nalcohol abuse disorder. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating condition under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear an established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily entered an alcohol rehabilitation program. He disclosed in his \nresponse to his government interrogatories that he has not consumed alcohol since \nAugust 2016, after he completed the program. There is no evidence to support that \nalcohol continues to be a problem in his life. The DUI charge he received was nolle \nprossed and it has been eight years since the offense occurred. I have considered all the \nevidence and find that a sufficient period of time has elapsed since his DUI arrest and his \nlast consumption of alcohol, and that future alcohol-related conduct is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) apply. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2010 for marijuana possession and in 2012 for DUI. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of marijuana charge was nolle prossed after he completed \nprobation and a drug rehabilitation program. Applicant told the government investigator \nthat he has not been involved in drugs since then and has no intention to be involved with \ndrugs in the future. He changed his life. The evidence supports that his past drug-related \nconduct is unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with DUI in 2012. This charge was also nolle prossed. \nApplicant acknowledged he was concerned about his alcohol consumption so he \nvoluntarily enrolled in an alcohol rehabilitation program that he successfully completed \nand has abstained from alcohol consumption since August 2016. There is no evidence of \nadditional misconduct. I believe future alcohol-related misconduct is unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose on his SCA that he had been charged with possession \nof marijuana and DUI in 2010 and 2012, respectively. He explained that he misread the \nquestion and believed it asked if he had been convicted of an offense involving drugs or \nalcohol. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. I found his statement credible and \ndo not believe he deliberately omitted or concealed this information. There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude Applicant deliberately failed to disclose this information. AG \u00b6 16(a) \ndoes not apply. Applicant was arrested in 2010 for marijuana possession and in 2012 for \na DUI. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to his criminal conduct.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug and alcohol charges were addressed under the criminal conduct \nguideline. The same issues were cross-alleged under the personal conduct guideline. No \nadditional facts were raised regarding Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct under the personal \nconduct guideline beyond the two charges. It has been 8 years since Applicant\u2019s DUI \ncharge and 10 years since his marijuana possession charge. Both charges were nolle \nprossed. Applicant has voluntarily completed an alcohol rehabilitation program since then \nand there has been no additional misconduct. Sufficient time has passed, and Applicant \nhas addressed his alcohol issues. It is unlikely additional problems associated with \nalcohol or drugs will recur, and his past conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. He successfully mitigated the security concerns raised \nabout his alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. But he failed to \nmeet his burden of persuasion regarding his financial issues. Although he is working with \na law firm to resolve his debts, the evidence is insufficient to conclude he has resolved or \npaid any of his debts or has a payment plan for his large student loans that have been \ndelinquent for years. He does not have a reliable financial track record, which raises \nquestions about his reliability, good judgment, and trustworthiness. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and \nGuideline J, criminal conduct, but failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2: Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.cc:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 33 years old. He is unmarried and does not have any children. Applicant is employed by a medical service company. He was hired in June 2018 as a unit coordinator. Prior to this employment, he had been unemployed from November 2017 until June 2018. He received unemployment benefits during a portion of his unemployment period. Applicant attended three years of college and stopped attending in 2015 due to family reasons. At the time he withdrew, he was majoring in physiology, and his grade point average was 3.62. Applicant\u2019s current monthly take-home pay is approximately $2,000. His employer requires him to be issued a trustworthiness determination in order to continue his employment. (Tr. 14-18, 22-23; GE 1) In 2012, Applicant began to experience financial difficulties following his hospitalization for a blood clot. From 2013 to November 2017, he was underemployed, working less than 20 hours a week, by a national appliance store for minimal pay.

His statement of reasons (SOR) lists nine delinquent debts. \nHe paid one debt, and the other eight debts are in payment plans for the past year. He \nhas made sufficient progress in resolving his delinquent debt. Eligibility for access to a \npublic trust position is granted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 5, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On October 21, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant an SOR, detailing trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017.    \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn November 14, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 4, 2020, the case was assigned to \nme, and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for February 25, 2020.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence, which I admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and \nrequested that I review the documents he submitted with his SOR response. At the \nrequest of Applicant, I held the record open until March 17, 2020 to submit additional \ndocumentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 5, 2020. On March \n17, 2020, Applicant provided three documents, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through C, and I admitted all three documents into evidence without objection. \nThe record was closed on March 17, 2020.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is unmarried and does not have any children. \nApplicant is employed by a medical service company. He was hired in June 2018 as a \nunit coordinator. Prior to this employment, he had been unemployed from November \n2017 until June 2018. He received unemployment benefits during a portion of his \nunemployment period. Applicant attended three years of college and stopped attending \nin 2015 due to family reasons. At the time he withdrew, he was majoring in physiology, \nand his grade point average was 3.62. Applicant\u2019s current monthly take-home pay is \napproximately $2,000. His employer requires him to be issued a trustworthiness \ndetermination in order to continue his employment. (Tr. 14-18, 22-23; GE 1) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant began to experience financial difficulties following his \nhospitalization for a blood clot. From 2013 to November 2017, he was underemployed, \nworking less than 20 hours a week, by a national appliance store for minimal pay. He \ntestified that, until recently, he was not educated about financial matters. The first time \nhe looked at a credit report occurred during his January 2019 background interview. \nOnce he realized the amount of his debt, he immediately contacted all of his creditors to \nbegin resolving his debts. He hopes one day he will be able to purchase a house, and \nhe cannot have lingering past-due debt if he is to achieve this goal. He values his \nemployment, and he is grateful for earning a decent income for the first time in his life. \n(Tr. 19-21, 37-38) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-f allege six delinquent Department of Education student loans placed \nfor collection in the amount of $34,190. Applicant admitted all of the student loans in his \nSOR response.  After he withdrew from college due to family reasons, his student loans \nbecame due immediately, which he could not afford to pay. He testified that he did pay \non his student loans for a short period of time while working part-time, but he had to \nstop after he was unable to afford the payments. Applicant stated that he started paying \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis student loans again after his January 2019 background interview. He is paying $5 a \nmonth to rehabilitate his student loans. He has maintained regular payments for \napproximately one year. At the hearing, Applicant did not have any documentation to \nverify his claim. Post-hearing documentation showed he has consistently made monthly \npayments from February 2019 to January 2020. (Tr. 25-32, AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are duplicate accounts for an unpaid cell phone service \naccount in the amount of about $763. Applicant provided documentation with his SOR \nresponse showing that he settled this account in November 2019 after he paid less than \nthe full balance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32; SOR response attachment)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j allege two unpaid medical accounts totaling $1,502. Applicant \ntestified that these accounts are related to his hospital stay in 2012. He stated that he \nhad been paying on these medical accounts after he completed his background \ninterview in January 2019, and he made regular monthly payments for approximately \none year. At the hearing, Applicant did not have any documentation to verify his claim. \nPost-hearing documentation showed from February 2019 to January 2020, Applicant \nconsistently made payments, totaling approximately $65, on his two delinquent medical \naccounts. (Tr. 34-36; AE A) \n \nOn March 17, 2020, Applicant submitted a bank account snapshot showing \nregular payments for his student loans and medical accounts from February 2019 \nthrough January 2020. He submitted a current employee performance appraisal which \nshowed he was highly ranked as an \u201cOutstanding Contributor\u201d for his employer. He also \nsent his monthly budget which showed that he had not accumulated any new debt. After \npaying all of his monthly expenses, Applicant is able to deposit approximately $130 a \nmonth into his savings account. (AE A, AE B, AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may \nbe made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.1 Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.2 An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government.3 An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s nine delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and \n1.h. are duplicates), totaling approximately $36,500. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 19(a) (an inability to \nsatisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n                                                        \n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n Applicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. His debts \nbecame delinquent between 2012 and 2018, while he was underemployed or \nunemployed, which are circumstances beyond his control. Beginning in January 2019, \nApplicant contacted all of his creditors and consistently made payments to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. Despite circumstances beyond his control, he acted responsibly to \naddress and resolve his financial delinquencies. AG 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply, and \n20(c) partially applies. Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the \nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of \nwhether to grant eligibility for a trustworthiness determination must be an overall \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant took positive action to resolve his financial delinquencies well before \nthe SOR was issued, and his financial issues are currently under control. I find that \nfuture delinquencies are unlikely to recur. After evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for public trust position is granted. \n \n \n \n                \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate the financial \nsecurity concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 30, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017, the Department \nof Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on \ninformation available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a review based on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2020. \nDepartment Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated January 30, \n2020. The Government submitted five Items for the record. Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM to provide additional information. \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 38, is single after two marriages and has two children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2000. He enlisted in the military (United States Marine Corps) in July \n2000 but in February 2001, he received a discharge under medical conditions which \nprevented him from completing training. Applicant completed a security clearance \napplication on July 16, 2018. (Item 3)  He is currently working for a federal contractor, \nwhich he started in 2018. He seeks to obtain a security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has three delinquent debts.  The first two are child \nsupport arrears in two states totaling approximately $82,000. (Item 1). The third is a \ntelecommunications collection account in the amount of $836. Applicant admits the \nalleged delinquent debts (SOR paragraphs 1.a through c.) (Item 2) His 2019 credit report \nconfirms the three SOR allegations. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant attributes the child support arrears to insufficient income since 2006. \n(Item 3) He did not have enough money to pay the full amount of child support, which is \n$100 monthly for each state. His wages have been garnished since 2013, but arrears still \nexist. He noted the amount of $60,000 on his security clearance application. He worked \nwith Lexington Law to help repair his credit, but he stopped working with them in 2018. \n(Item 4) \n \nApplicant reported one period of unemployment from July 2012 to February 2013. \nHe has worked steadily since that time. He has lived with his parents from February 2013 \nuntil August 2018. He now lives with his sister. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant presented no information as to the current status of any of the debts \nalleged. He did not report any contact with the creditor for the collection account. He \nintends to pay his bills in the future. He provided no information or documentation of any \npayments he may have made regarding child support. In his subject interview, he \ndisclosed that he had about $3,000 in medical debt. (Item 4) He stated that he plans to \nset up payment arrangements. \n \nThere is no information in the record concerning his earnings or that he uses a \nbudget or that he is now seeking financial counseling. He described his financial situation \nas \u201cfair.\u201d (Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgements, corroborated by his credit report establishes two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s child support arrears have been garnished beginning in 2013. He did \nreport a period of unemployment but did not provide a nexus between that period of \nunemployment and his child support issues stemming from 2006. He owes a substantial \namount of child support, and claims it is based on low income but provided no information \nconcerning his wages.  His monthly obligation was $200 for the two states involved.  The \nrecord is not clear as to when, if ever, he was making voluntary payments and how the \narrearage reached such a substantial amount.  \n\n \n5 \n \nHe failed to produce any explanation or documentation as to his efforts to address \nhis financial issues. Little weight is given to the garnishment since there is no evidence \nthat he ever voluntarily paid child support.  He has failed to show a track record of any \npayments or that his financial situation is under control. The record is devoid of any \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant has not met his burden of proof in this case. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his period of unemployment, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness.

Billett, Esq. \n06/09/2020 \nDecision \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant was involved in two workplace altercations in 2017. Both involved \nalcohol. Although the security concerns about his use of alcohol are mitigated, Applicant \nwas unable to refute or mitigate the corresponding concerns about his personal conduct. \nAccordingly, the security concerns about his personal conduct are not mitigated and his \nrequest for a security clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 6, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn August 28, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case is governed by Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. With \nhis response, he proffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 H. I received the case on \nDecember 16, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on January 29, 2020. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant appeared as \nscheduled, testified, and proffered two additional exhibits, AX I and J. I received a \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 10, 2020. \n \nProcedural Notes \n \n \nWith the exception of GX 4, all exhibits were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel objected to the admission of GX 4 on grounds that it did not meet the business \nrecords exception to the hearsay rule. After hearing from both parties, I sustained \nApplicant\u2019s objection for reasons stated during the hearing (Tr. 19 \u2013 27). I did not consider \nGX 4 in reaching my decision, and it has been marked for identification purposes and \nincluded with the case file. During the hearing, I allowed Department Counsel to ask \nquestions about the exhibit over the objection of Applicant\u2019s counsel. In so doing, \nDepartment Counsel laid a proper foundation for admission of GX 4 that was not \npreviously established. Nonetheless, Department Counsel did not renew his request for \nadmission of GX 4. (Tr. 82 \u2013 90) \n \n \nAX H is a report from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) who conducted an \nevaluation by video teleconference (VTC) of Applicant on October 7, 2019. The author \nalso is a certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), a master addiction counselor \n(MAC), and a substance abuse professional (SAP). In her report, she made certain \nclinical findings about Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol. In so doing, the LCSW presented certain \nobservations and conclusions about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. (AX \nH, at pages 4 and 5) I have considered the author\u2019s qualifications and her clinical findings \nas part of the record evidence as a whole. However, her qualifications do not include \nexperience in the adjudication of DOD security clearance matters. Even had she \nestablished such qualifications, in DOHA proceedings the ultimate conclusion about an \nindividual\u2019s suitability to have access to sensitive information is the sole province of the \nadministrative judge. Accordingly, I have not considered the author\u2019s specific conclusions \nabout Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that in June 2017, Applicant instigated \na verbal and physical altercation with defense contractor co-workers and that he had \nconsumed alcohol beforehand (SOR 1.a); and that in November 2017, Applicant \ninstigated a verbal and physical altercation with defense contractor co-workers on board \na U.S. Navy ship on which they were working overseas (SOR 1.b). The conduct at SOR \n1.a was cross-alleged as alcohol-related misconduct under Guideline G (SOR 2.a). In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied, with explanations, both SOR allegations. (Tr. 8 \n\u2013 9) Based on my review of the record evidence as a whole, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and employed since February 2018 as an electrical \nengineer for a defense contractor. He previously worked as an electrical engineer for \nanother defense contractor (Company A) from July 2014 until February 2018. Applicant \ngraduated from college in May 2014 with a degree in electrical engineering, and was first \ngranted a security clearance not long after he was hired by Company A. (Answer; GX 1; \nAX A; AX B; Tr. 74) \n \n \nBetween July 2014 and April 2016, Applicant\u2019s work with Company A occurred in \nthe United States in direct support of a military aviation electronics program. In April 2016, \nhe transferred to a division of Company A that provided technical support that required \nhim to deploy aboard U.S. Navy ships. Applicant was attracted to that work, in part, \nbecause his pay almost doubled from extra pay and benefits he received for being at sea. \nThe extra income enabled him to pay off his student loans by 2017. The ships on which \nhe worked were not front-line combatants; rather, they were commissioned Navy auxiliary \nships manned either by a detachment of uniformed Navy personnel and employees of the \nMilitary Sealift Command (MSC) or by civilian mariners contracted by DOD. Applicant and \nhis coworkers were working passengers embarked aboard those ships. Applicant began \nhis work aboard Ship 1 in April 2016. In April 2017, he transferred to Ship 2 where the \nevents at issue occurred. On each ship, he and his team of contractors worked at sea for \nbetween 30 and 60 days at a time, with periods of leave between voyages. Applicant\u2019s \nlast deployment ended in November 2017, after which he took about one month of leave \nbefore leaving the company for work with his current employer. His current job does not \nrequire him to leave the country and he again is working in support of military aviation \nelectronics missions. (Answer; GX 1; AX A; Tr. 34 \u2013 37, 39, 81, 103) \n \n \nOn June 26, 2017, after 45 days at sea, Applicant and four coworkers went ashore \nduring a brief port visit to shop for provisions and to relax. They eventually found their \nway to a local restaurant and bar before returning to the ship. After they had something \nto eat, they had a few drinks and played a few games of pool. After almost two months at \nsea, they were \u201cletting off a little steam.\u201d Sometime that evening, Applicant and another \nemployee (L) got into an argument and a minor physical altercation ensued. L put \nApplicant in a headlock and Applicant shoved him after he got out of L\u2019s grasp. Applicant \nshouted at L, and then left the bar after another coworker tried to intercede, seeking to \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nhave Applicant and L \u201chash things out.\u201d Applicant took a taxi back to the ship without \nfurther incident. Applicant denies he instigated the altercation, and no disciplinary action \nwas taken by the company. He avers he had four or five beers during the evening, and \nhe acknowledged at hearing that not having consumed alcohol may have produced a \ndifferent result that evening. (Answer; GX 2; AX F; AX H; Tr. 42 \u2013 54) \n \n \nIn November 2017, while Applicant and his coworkers were nearing the end of \nanother long period at sea. While heading back to port, they were generally in an off-duty \nstatus with a lot of time on their hands. On November 4, Applicant was involved in another \naltercation with L. Again, his coworkers K and R were present. An adverse information \nreport of this incident submitted through the Joint Personnel Adjudications System (JPAS) \ndescribed Applicant as intoxicated to the point of being sick. It also states that Applicant \nbecame violent as L, K and R tried to assist him, yelling obscenities while striking K in the \nchest and head and grabbing L by his genitals. The event ended when a supervisor (S) \narrived and Applicant was returned to his stateroom. Applicant subsequently was \nassigned to a different work section to be separated from L until the ship arrived in port. \nApplicant then went on previously scheduled leave for about a month. (Answer; GX2; GX \n3; Tr. 62) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s version of what happened on November 4 differs markedly from the \nJPAS report. That report also referred to the June 26 incident and to a March 11, 2017 \nincident (not addressed in the SOR), all involving altercations with L. Applicant denies \nthat he was involved in a March incident because he was not yet on board Ship 2, the \nonly place he and L worked together. Emails show that Applicant was in the process of \narranging a transfer from Ship 1 to Ship 2 in late February 2017 because of a hostile work \nenvironment aboard Ship 1. Logistically, it does not appear that Applicant could have \narrived at Ship 2 by March 11. The JPAS report also states that Applicant did not require \nmedical attention after his November altercation with L; however, Applicant testified that \nhe asked for medical attention in his stateroom to treat a cut over his eye. He further \ndenies kicking K or grabbing L as described in the report. (Answer; GX 3; AX F; AX H; \nAX I; Tr. 55 \u2013 72, 79, 98) \n \n \nAvailable information shows that alcohol was allowed aboard ship during off-duty \nhours. Applicant did not affirm or deny that he or others consumed alcohol on November \n4; however, it is apparent from all of the information probative of that issue that alcohol \nwas involved in the incident. In response to questions on direct and cross-examination, \nas well as from the bench, about the details in the JPAS adverse information report -- \nwhether he had vomited and required assistance; whether he was intoxicated; whether \nanyone was drinking; whether he directed a racial epithet at a coworker -- he provided \nanswers such as \u201cI do not recall\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t believe so\u201d or \u201cthat doesn\u2019t sound familiar to \nme\u201d or \u201cI have no recollection\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific memory.\u201d At the same time, he \nhad a clear recollection of finding empty and partially-filled alcoholic beverage containers \nin his stateroom after the incident and that he asked S to call for medical assistance. \nWhile acknowledging that the only fights he has ever been in were those documented in \nthis case, he could not provide many details of what happened on those two occasions. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant spent several months aboard ship in a unique employment setting, yet he could \nnot say one way or the other whether alcohol use was allowed on board. His answers to \nquestions about whether he used a racial epithet were equivocal at best. In short, I found \nApplicant\u2019s testimony to be evasive and less than credible when pressed on the details \nof what happened on November 4. (Tr. 58 \u2013 59, 60, 76, 82 \u2013 83, 90 \u2013 91, 93, 95, 97, 101 \n\u2013 103, 113) \n \n \nCompany A\u2019s human resources department investigated the June and November \nincidents sometime after the ship returned in November 2017. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he has read the statements of L, K, and S that were provided as part that \ninvestigation. Applicant also provided a statement as part of that investigation but testified \nthat he does not recall what he said in that statement. No disciplinary action was taken \nby Company A, and Applicant voluntarily left his position with that employer in February \n2018. He did so, in part, because of the two altercations and, in part, because he wanted \na job that would allow him to stay in the United States and be closer to his girlfriend. He \nno longer needed the same income because he had paid off his student loans. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; Tr. 37 \u2013 39, 63 \u2013 64, 71 \u2013 74) \n \n \nApplicant denies that he abuses alcohol or that he uses alcohol on other than an \ninfrequent social basis. A clinical evaluation by an LCSW was conducted on October 7, \n2019. The VTC evaluation lasted 90 minutes and included several tests to determine if \nApplicant suffers from any alcohol-related disorder. The LCSW concluded that no such \ndiagnosis is warranted, and that there is no need for Applicant to undergo alcohol-related \ncounseling or to modify his drinking habits. During the evaluation, Applicant recounted \nthe June and November 2017 events at issue here. As to the latter event, Applicant did \nnot indicate that alcohol was involved. (AX G; AX H) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s on-the-job performance for Company A and for his current employer \nhas been very good. Several character references speak highly of his professionalism, \nreliability, and technical expertise. His performance evaluations generally have been \nsuperior, noting his potential for continued success. Applicant lives a healthy lifestyle and \npursues a variety of interests outside of work, including scuba diving, obtaining a private \npilot\u2019s license, and personal fitness training.  (Answer; AX C \u2013 E; AX J; Tr. 31 \u2013 34) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAvailable information reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s use \nof alcohol. That security concern is stated at AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nMore specifically, the June 2017 incident was an off-duty altercation that occurred \nafter Applicant had been drinking. This requires application of the disqualifying condition \nat AG \u00b6 22(a): \n \nalcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant established that he does \nnot suffer from any alcohol-related disorder and that he has not consumed alcohol to the \npoint of intoxication since 2017. He also showed that he leads a stable, healthy lifestyle \nthat is consistent with sobriety or moderate social drinking. The mitigating condition at AG \n\u00b6 23(a) applies: \n \nso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \n \n \nThe facts and circumstances presented are sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns under this guideline. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nAvailable information most directly invokes the general security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and trustworthiness that is stated at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nApplicant displayed poor judgment when he was involved in two workplace \nincidents in 2017. Accordingly, the Government reasonably sought to examine those \nincidents to determine whether Applicant currently has the requisite judgment, \ntrustworthiness and reliability for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s apparent \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nunwillingness to provide clear and accurate answers to questions about his conduct and \nabout what happened, particularly as it relates to the second incident, has hindered the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to conduct a well-informed assessment of Applicant\u2019s suitability. \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies, but only insofar as the low probability that Applicant will get \ninto another fight in the workplace. Those events occurred under circumstances (working \nin close quarters for long periods at sea) that are not likely to recur. Nonetheless, \nApplicant\u2019s obfuscation in his testimony about those events precludes full application of \neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(b) or 17(c). The Government presented sufficient information in the form \nof a JPAS report to support the SOR allegations that Applicant instigated both \naltercations. In response to the Government\u2019s case, Applicant did not successfully refute \nthe Government\u2019s information because he did not provide credible testimony in support \nof his version of events, particularly when it comes to the details of the second incident. \nThese facts are necessary to making a fully informed predictive judgment about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for continued access to classified information. All of the information \nprobative of what happened in November 2017 indicates that Applicant instigated that \naltercation, likely while in a state of intoxication. Applicant has not provided sufficient \ninformation to alter that conclusion. To the contrary, his testimony served only to cast \nfurther doubt on his trustworthiness. This is recent and significant behavior that \nundermines confidence that Applicant can be relied on to be candid and forthright with \nthe government in his fiduciary duties regarding sensitive information. On balance, the \nsecurity concerns raised under this guideline are not mitigated. \n \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). I particularly note the positive information about his professional qualifications and \nhis work in the defense industry, as well as the recommendations of his friends and \ncoworkers. Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent testimony about his conduct creates \npersistent doubts about his judgment and reliability. Because protection of the interests \nof national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be \nresolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/20/2020 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 29, 2018. On \nAugust 28, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 16, 2019 and November 26, 2019, and \nrequested a decision on the written record without a hearing. On January 16, 2020, the \nGovernment sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 7. She was given \nan opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the \nFORM on January 28, 2020, and timely submitted her response on February 27, 2020, \n\n \n2 \n \nto which the Government did not object. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the case. I \nadmitted Items 2 through 7 into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents \nthat I admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The case was \nassigned to me on March 11, 2020. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s February 2018 security clearance interview (SI) (Item \n3) was included among the evidence proffered by the Government. Item 3 was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 3. The Government included in the FORM a notice \nadvising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of Item 3 on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if she did not raise any objection \nto Item 3 in her response to the FORM, or if she did not respond to the FORM, she \ncould be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 3 could be \nconsidered as evidence in her case. Applicant did not raise any objection to Item 3 in \nher FORM response or otherwise.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 43, has four adult children. She divorced in February 2012 after \nfour years of marriage, and remarried in June 2018. She served on active duty from \n1994 through 1996 with the U.S. Marine Corps, and from 2003 through 2006 with the \nU.S. Army. She earned an associate degree in 2008 and a nurse-aid certificate in 2017. \nShe has been employed by a military medical center since June 2018. She reported \nthat she was granted a DOD security clearance in 2017. However, it is unclear from the \nrecord on what basis it was granted since she was not then employed by a defense \ncontractor. (Items 1, 3) \n \nApplicant admitted each of the 11 debts alleged in the SOR, which totaled \n$64,521. She has not paid any of those debts. In her SOR answer, Applicant claimed \nthat 1) she was in negotiations to settle the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j, \nand 2) the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h and 1.k had been removed from her \ncredit report. She did not provide documents sufficient to corroborate either claim. Only \nthree of the alleged debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c) appear on her most recent credit \nreport. (AE A, B; Items 1, 7)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports dated June 2018 and August 2019 confirm each of the \nalleged debts. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i through 1.k are \nindividual accounts (totaling $39,002) and the remaining alleged debts are joint \naccounts (totaling $25,519). All but one of the joint accounts was opened during the \nApplicant\u2019s first marriage. For reasons not specified in the record, the joint debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. was opened after the divorce. (Items 6, 7) \n \nApplicant engaged the services of a credit repair company to assist her with \ncorrecting what she described as \u201cinaccuracies\u201d in her credit reports. She asserted that \nthe inaccuracies related to reporting debts for which her former spouse was solely \n\n \n3 \n \nresponsible. In letters dated January and October 2019, the company proffered that \nApplicant \u201chas a responsible credit history\u201d and that it initiated a case against \u201cthe \ncreditors involved\u201d in order \u201cto prove that her credit report contains major discrepancies \nthrough no fault of her own.\u201d Neither Applicant nor the company specified details or \nprovided documents to corroborate their claims. There is no evidence in the record that \nApplicant received financial counseling from the company or elsewhere. (AE A, B; Item \n2 at 13) \n \nApplicant was not aware that her home mortgage was delinquent until her first \nhusband petitioned for divorce in September 2011. The foreclosure alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h was finalized sometime in 2012. When confronted during her 2018 SI, Applicant \nasserted that she had no knowledge of the delinquent status of the accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.c through 1.g, and 1.i through 1.k. She maintained that those accounts all \nbelonged to her former spouse, who managed their finances during the marriage \nwithout consulting her or allowing her to see any records. (Item 3 at 5-6) \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to each of the questions in the financial record section \nof her 2018 SCA and did not otherwise disclose her foreclosure or any delinquent debts \ntherein. Five of the six individual accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j) were in \ndelinquent status well before she completed her 2018 SCA. Applicant did not address \nduring her SI or elsewhere in the record why she failed to report the foreclosure or her \nthen delinquent individual accounts on her SCA. The omissions were not alleged in the \nSOR and will be considered only for the purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole \nperson concept. (Item 2 at 33-35; Item 3 at 5; Items 6, 7) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)  \n \nThe SOR allegations establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations).  \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant is credited with engaging the services of a company to assist her with \nrepairing her credit. However, she did not establish that either she or the company \nnegotiated repayment agreements, made payments pursuant to any such agreements, \nfully paid or otherwise resolved the debts. She failed to establish that the debts which \ndid not appear on her recent credit report were removed because she is not responsible \nfor repayment. The mere disappearance of debts from a credit report does not, without \nmore, absolve her from liability. She did not establish that her debts were attributable \nlargely to circumstances beyond her control. While her former spouse may have \nincurred debts for which he was solely responsible, that fact was not corroborated in the \nrecord. Nevertheless, Applicant also has substantial individual debts that remain \nunresolved and for which she failed to demonstrate that she acted responsibly to \naddress. Thus, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by her delinquent debts. The fact that Applicant did not disclose at least \nthe foreclosure on her SCA further undercuts mitigation. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Tr. 45.) He received a letter of \nappreciation for his exceptional performance during his last deployment. (AX L.) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $39,000. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from June 2019 and October 2018 (GX 2 and 3.) The evidence \nconcerning these debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: deficiency of $23,362 after repossession of a vehicle. Applicant \npurchased this vehicle in August 2017 for his second ex-wife. Applicant signed the loan \nand his mother cosigned it. Applicant made the first payment and counted on his ex-wife \nto make subsequent payments. The vehicle was repossessed in January 2018 because \nhis ex-wife did not make any payments even though Applicant sent her the funds for that \npurpose. He knew when the repossession occurred because his neighbor knocked on the \ndoor and told him that the vehicle had just been towed away. He asked his then wife if \nshe had been making the payments and she replied that she had not. (Tr. 46-47.) \nIn July 2018, Applicant informed his employer about the repossession, some other \nfinancial delinquencies, and a protective order against him obtained by his then wife. (GX \n4.) When Applicant answered the SOR in November 2019, he stated that he was unable \nto redeem the vehicle because he was catching up on other bills such as his mortgage \npayments, utility bills, and car payments that were also three or four months past due. He \ndid not contact the lender for the repossessed vehicle until about a week before the \nhearing. He testified that he did not contact the lender earlier, because he was waiting \nuntil the vehicle was sold so that the amount due could be calculated. (Tr. 46-49.) After \nthe hearing, he contacted the creditor about a payment agreement and made a $100 \npayment on this debt. As of the date the record closed, Applicant and the creditor had not \nreached an agreement on the amount due or a payment plan. (AX Y; AX BB.) \n3 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent vehicle loan placed for collection of $10,996. In April \n2018, while Applicant and his then wife were separated, he bought an inexpensive used \ncar for her after the first one was repossessed, because he did not want her and their \nchildren to be stranded without transportation. He obtained the loan in his name and his \nex-wife\u2019s. His ex-wife agreed to make the payments, which were around $360 per month. \nHe trusted his ex-wife to make the payments, notwithstanding her previous \nirresponsibility. She surrendered the vehicle instead of making any payments. (Tr. 52-\n53.) She filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in January 2019. She converted her \nbankruptcy to a Chapter 7 in April 2019. The bankruptcy petition was filed solely in his ex-\nwife\u2019s name. (AX P.) Applicant was notified of the bankruptcy filing by mail, because he \nand his ex-wife are co-owners of the marital home, where Applicant currently lives. (Tr. \n64.) He believes he will be responsible for part of the debt even if his ex-wife obtains a \nChapter 7 discharge. (Tr. 52-54.) He testified that he expected the bankruptcy to be \ncompleted \u201cwithin the next few months,\u201d but that his ex-wife and her bankruptcy attorney \nrefused to give him any information. (Tr. 63-64.) The record does not reflect the status of \nthe bankruptcy.

As of the date the record closed, he had not yet \nreached an agreement or made any payments. (AX BB.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: unsecured personal loan charged off for $1,894. Applicant testified \nthat he obtained this loan early in his Navy service, around 2013. He testified, \u201cI was \nyoung, I wasn\u2019t smart with money. I wanted to buy the newest video game system at the \ntime.\u201d He took no action to resolve this debt because he had \u201cother things that kind of \ntook precedence.\u201d (Tr. 56.) He made a $150 payment on September 1, 2020, and he \ntestified that he intends to continue making payments until the debt is satisfied. (AX M; \nTr. 56-57.) He does not have a formal payment agreement. (Tr. 66.) In his post-hearing \nstatement, he promised that the debt will be resolved by the end of October 2020. (AX \nBB.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: cellphone account placed for collection of $1,303. The October \n2018 credit report reflects that this account was placed for collection in October 2018. \n(GX 3 at 5.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he disputed this debt because \nhe turned off his cellphone while he was deployed while on active duty in 2009 or 2010, \nbut the provider continued to charge him for the service. (Tr. 66-67.) It is not reflected in \nthe June 2019 credit report submitted by Department Counsel or the September 2020 \ncredit report submitted by Applicant. (GX 3; AX O.) At the hearing, he testified that he did \nnot intend to pay this debt, because it was not reflected in the credit reports. (Tr. 75.) After \nthe hearing, he submitted documentary evidence that the debt was paid and that the \ncreditor submitted a request that the account be deleted from his credit record. (AX W.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: cellphone account placed for collection of $1,501. Applicant \ntestified that he disputed this account because it was in another person\u2019s name who used \nhis Social Security number. (Tr. 66-67.) He testified that he did not intend to pay this debt \nfor the same reason that he did not intend to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, i.e., it \nwas not reflected in the credit reports. After the hearing, he submitted documentary \nevidence that he had paid the debt on September 11, 2020. (AX X.)  \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence that he filed a dispute in February \n2020 and another on September 15, 2020. (AX Z.) However, the document does not \nreflect the debts being disputed, the basis for the disputes, or the results of the disputes. \nApplicant\u2019s stepfather testified for Applicant. (He was erroneously identified as \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law during the hearing.) He testified that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife called \nApplicant\u2019s mother while Applicant was deployed and asked for a loan to pay bills. \nApplicant\u2019s mother lent Applicant\u2019s ex-wife $2,400 to pay bills and later discovered that \nshe deposited the money in an account and did not pay the bills. (Tr. 20.) Applicant\u2019s \nstepfather testified that when Applicant returned from deployment he found that his then \nwife had moved out of the marital home and taken all the furniture with her. (Tr. 23.) \nApplicant\u2019s stepfather later loaned Applicant about $7,000 to hire a divorce lawyer.

He borrowed money from a friend for the down payment. His monthly payments \non the loan are $363. (Tr. 60-61.) \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement from August 31, 2020, reflects net monthly \nincome of $4,653, expenses of $4,504, and a net remainder of $159. It does not include \nthe income of $1,733 he receives under the GI Bill for living expenses. (Tr. 59-60.) The \nlisted expenses include child support of $1,400, a $150 payment to the creditor alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c, and monthly payments on the vehicle that Applicant recently purchased. It \nalso reflects monthly savings of $50, leaving $109 in discretionary income. (AX B.) \nApplicant estimated that he has borrowed about $2,000 from his mother and has repaid \nher about $600 or $700. (Tr. 61-62.) He has not repaid his father for the $7,000 loan for \nattorney\u2019s fees. (Tr. 21.) Applicant\u2019s FICO scores in September 2020 ranged from 562 to \n626, in the \u201cfair\u201d range. (AX Q-U, AA.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, but not for \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous \nand recent. However, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were the result of a failing \nmarriage and his ex-wife\u2019s financial irresponsibility. He is now divorced and unlikely to \nincur future debts caused by his ex-wife. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment from May 2015 to March 2016 may have been a condition largely beyond \nis control, but it is unclear whether his unemployment from June to November 2015, while \nhe was attending college, was involuntary. Furthermore, his financial problems did not \nbegin until late 2017 or early 2018, well after he was hired for his current job. On the other \nhand, his marital breakup and his ex-wife\u2019s irresponsible conduct were conditions largely \nbeyond his control and the cause of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, he has not \nacted responsibly regarding this debt. He did not contact this creditor until a week before \nthe hearing, even though the repossession occurred in January 2018, he was notified \nimmediately by a neighbor that it had occurred, and he reported it to his employer in July \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2018. \u201cA person who begins to address concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 15-03696 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019, citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant learned \nabout this debt when he was notified by mail of his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition in April \n2019. He testified that he believed he received the notification because he and his ex-\nwife are co-owners on the marital home. The disposition of the marital home was still \npending at the time of the hearing. However, this debt was not caused by a condition \nlargely beyond his control. It was caused by his bad judgment, deciding to incur another \nsubstantial debt and rely on his irresponsible ex-wife to pay it, knowing that she had \nrecently failed to make the mortgage payments, pay the utility bills, and make the \npayments on the vehicle that had been repossessed three months earlier. He contacted \nthe creditor but had not reached an agreement as of the date the record closed. (AX BB.) \nThe record does not reflect the current status of the bankruptcy. The June 2019 credit \nreport lists the debt as a collection account. (GX2 at 2.) \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. \nApplicant made one $100 payment on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a but has not reached \na payment agreement or demonstrated a track record of payments. He has not made any \npayments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant has made one payment of $150 \non the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, declared his intention to resolve it, and included monthly \n$150 payments in his personal budget, but he has not yet established a track record of \nmonthly payments. This mitigating condition is established for the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, which have been paid. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established for the two delinquent cellphone accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Applicant initially disputed these two accounts, and he testified that \nhe believed his disputes were successful, because the debts were not reflected in recent \ncredit reports. Applicant submitted a document reflecting a dispute filed in February 2020 \nand another in September 2020, after the hearing. However, the document does not \nidentify the debts being disputed or the basis for the disputes. He paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d in December 2016 and paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e two days after the hearing. \nThe evidence indicates that these debts were deleted from his credit reports because he \nsettled them and not because they were disputed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Since 2017, she has been working for a defense contractor. (Tr. 17) Applicant is highly respected on the job. Her current supervisor characterized her as extremely trustworthy and honest. (AE C at 1) A previous supervisor characterized her as \u201chardworking, flexible, and adaptive.\u201d (AE B at 3) In 2019, she received a certificate for exceptional performance. (AE G) Applicant is active in her community, volunteering for an organization that helps disabled people. (AE C) Applicant used cocaine approximately three to four times while in college. (Tr.19; GE D at 2) She stopped using cocaine during her senior year in 2003. After graduating from college, she returned home and reconnected with some high school friends.

Clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \nsecurity to grant her security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Nat.

The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2020. \nThe hearing was initially scheduled for April 23, 2020, but was continued indefinitely \nbecause of the coronavirus pandemic. On August 7, 2020, the case was rescheduled for \nSeptember 14, 2020. The hearing was held as rescheduled. I received and incorporated \nfour government exhibits into the record, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \nGE 4, and I incorporated seven Applicant exhibits (AE), accepted into the record as AE A \nthrough AE G. In addition, I received the testimony of Applicant and two character \nwitnesses. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 28, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old, married woman with two children, ages six and four. She \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in 1998 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. Since 2017, she \nhas been working for a defense contractor. (Tr. 17) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. Her current supervisor characterized her as \nextremely trustworthy and honest. (AE C at 1) A previous supervisor characterized her as \n\u201chardworking, flexible, and adaptive.\u201d (AE B at 3) In 2019, she received a certificate for \nexceptional performance. (AE G) Applicant is active in her community, volunteering for an \norganization that helps disabled people. (AE C) \nApplicant used cocaine approximately three to four times while in college. (Tr.19; GE \nD at 2) She stopped using cocaine during her senior year in 2003. After graduating from \ncollege, she returned home and reconnected with some high school friends. She resumed \nher cocaine use while socializing with them, using approximately two or three times \nbetween 2003 and 2008. (Answer at 3; Tr. 22) One of her episodes of cocaine use \noccurred after she had been granted a security clearance. (Tr. 45) She has not used \ncocaine since 2008. \nApplicant no longer socializes with the people with whom she used cocaine after \ngraduating from college. (Tr. 26) She is the primary income earner in her family and is \ndedicated to living a responsible, healthy lifestyle, and setting a good example for her \nchildren. (Tr. 32; AE D at 2) On October 24, 2019, Applicant executed an affidavit \nmemorializing her intention not to resume cocaine use in the future. (AE F) \nOn October 28, 2019, Applicant was evaluated by a certified substance abuse \ncounselor. (AE D) The counselor characterized Applicant\u2019s cocaine use as \u201cshort-term\u201d and \n\u201cnon-patterned,\u201d falling well below the threshold for misuse or abuse. (AE D at 3-4) \nConsidering the sporadic nature of the cocaine use and length of time that has elapsed \nsince Applicant last used cocaine, the counselor concluded that it no longer posed a \npotential security concern. (AE D at 5-6) \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose her cocaine use when disclosure was \nrequired on a security clearance application completed in 2004. She omitted this \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninformation because she \u201cwas just too ashamed to admit that [she] had ever done anything \nlike that.\u201d (Tr. 27) \nIn 2016, Applicant completed another security clearance application. She \u201cdoubled \ndown\u201d and again deliberately omitted her past cocaine use. (Tr. 27) When she completed \nthe application, she was eight months pregnant, and did not want \u201cto let [her] family down.\u201d \nApplicant was haunted by her falsifications. This prompted her to disclose them on a \nsecurity clearance application completed in 2018. (GE 1 at 33) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to  comply with laws, rules, and regulations. . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s use of cocaine between 2000 and 2008, including on one occasion that \noccurred when she held a security clearance, triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance misuse,\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nAccording to a substance abuse counselor who evaluated Applicant in 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s cocaine use was infrequent and did not reach the threshold to be characterized \nas abuse. Applicant has not used cocaine in more than ten years, and no longer associates \nwith the people with whom she used cocaine. Moreover, she executed a statement of intent \nnot to resume cocaine use in the future. Under these circumstances, the following \nmitigating conditions apply under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; . . \n[and], \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s cocaine use was casual, infrequent, and remote in time, she \nintentionally failed to disclose it, when disclosure was required, on two separate security \nclearance applications in 2004 and 2016, respectively. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nFear of the consequences of disclosing adverse information does not mitigate the \nintentional failure to disclose it on security clearance applications. (DISCR OSD No. 89-\n1586 at 4 (App. Bd. October 26, 1990). Moreover, although Applicant ultimately disclosed \nher falsifications, she did not do so until 14 years after her first falsification and two years \nafter the repeated falsification on her second security clearance application. Under these \ncircumstances, the relevant, potentially mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before \nbeing confronted with the facts,\u201d does not apply. While Applicant showed some reform \nunder AG \u00b6 17(d) by admitting her falsifications during her subject interview, this effort at \nrectification is too belated to conclude that \u201csuch behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant\u2019s cocaine use was infrequent and remote in time. In tandem with the \nsubstance abuse counselor\u2019s favorable evaluation, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concern. Conversely, Applicant failed to \ndisclose her cocaine use during the course of two security clearance investigations. The \nnature and seriousness of these transgressions and their repeated nature generate \nunmitigated security concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

(Item 2 at page 6.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness, including back taxes of about \n$240,000. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant has not acted responsibly as to the vast majority \nof his past-due indebtedness. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.c.~1.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.f.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

(Answer.) The case was assigned \nto me on November 19, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on November 19, 2019, scheduling the hearing for December \n17, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits \n(GXs) 1 through 6, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf. The record was left open until January 17, 2020, for receipt of additional \n\n \n2 \n \ndocumentation. Applicant offered two sets of documents, marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AppXs) A and B, which were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (TR) on January 2, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR, with explanations through \nattachments. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 7.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor, off-and-on, since January of 2015. \n(TR at page 12 line 11 to page 14 line 7.) He has held a security clearance since 2015. \n(GX 1 at pages 44~45.) He is single, and has no children. (GX 1 at page 31.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a.~1.h. Applicant admits that he was behind in repayment of eight separate \nstudent loan debts totaling about $42,019. He is now current with his student loan \ndebts, and repayment is in deferment as Applicant is attending graduate school. This is \nevidenced by documentation provided by Applicant in his Answer. (TR at page 14 line 8 \nto page 18 line 14.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a cable provider for $77, as the \nresult of an unexpected cancellation fee. (TR at page 18 line 15 to page 20 line 7.)  \nApplicant has paid this fee, as evidenced by \u201cCHECKCARD\u201d documentation. (AppX A.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant has an excellent work record, as evidenced by a recent performance \nappraisal. (AppX B.)   \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant unaddressed student loans, and an unexpected small \npast-due debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans have been addressed and are now in deferment. He \nhas also paid a small, unexpected cable termination debt. Applicant has demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been \nestablished. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry. He \nperforms well at his job. (AppX B.)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.~1.i.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 17, 2018. \nOn August 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 22, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \nnotice of hearing on December 11, 2019, and the hearing was convened on January 15, \n2020. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence without \n\n \n2 \n \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were \nadmitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 28, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old staff duty driver for a defense contractor, employed since \nSeptember 2018. He graduated from high school in 1981 and completed some college \ncredits. He served on active duty in the United States Army from 1982 until he was \nhonorably discharged in 1985. He was married in 1985 and divorced in 1995; again \nmarried in 1996 and divorced in 1998; and last remarried in 2006. He has three biological \nchildren and two step children. One eight-year-old child lives with him. Applicant was laid \noff from a job in June 2014 and remained unemployed until November 2014. He was \ndismissed from a job in February 2016 until he was employed in October 2016. He was \nagain laid off in May 2017. While unemployed, he drove a car for hire, and when \nreemployed in his current position in September 2018, he continued to drive a car for hire \non a part-time basis. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $29,000 in delinquent debts. \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations, and stated in his Answer to the SOR that he was \nunaware of some of the medical debts alleged. He noted that he was generally current \non all of his debts until about January 2018, when he was unable to make ends meet and \nhad to choose which debts to pay. \n \nApplicant has not addressed any of the SOR debts. He lives from paycheck -to -\npaycheck and has little to no savings. He used $18,000 in his retirement plan to pay a \ndebt in 2018, and owns a house valued at $150,000 with a mortgage of $126,000. He is \npaying his mortgage, car loan, and student loans (owes $11,000) on time, but is unable \nto make payments on other debts. He testified that he was told by his employer that he \nshould not seek financial counseling or bankruptcy protection, as it would preclude him \nfrom receiving a security clearance. Regardless, Applicant has had no contact with \ncreditors nor has he made attempts to resolve his debts. \n \nApplicant and his spouse are both working, and earn about $65,500 in net pay. He \nis supported by his team lead and human resources manager. Both believe Applicant is \nan employee in good standing, trustworthy, and well-liked by the soldiers he serves. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that remain unresolved. The \ndebts appear to have resulted from periods of unemployment and underemployment, and \nhe was instructed by his employer not to seek financial assistance. However, Applicant \nhas not shown efforts to resolve debts. Despite being poorly informed about financial \nassistance, he does not have the financial means to pay debts, and appears to live above \nhis means.  \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial status raises significant doubts about his financial \nmanagement decisions, personal responsibility, and ability to address delinquent debts. I \nam not convinced Applicant makes good financial decisions, and his financial status \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No \nmitigation conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and difficult employment history. However, I remain \nunconvinced of his financial responsibility and ability to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n    Subparagraphs 1.a -  1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 8, 2019, the Defense of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 26, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 27, 2020. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January \n30, 2020, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 5 2020. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1-2, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant \ntestified and offered exhibits (AE) A-C, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 13, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations. I have incorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is married with two children. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He is an engineer. He has worked for a defense contractor since October 2018. \nHe has never held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application \n(SCA) in September 2018. (Tr. 6, 17; GE 1)   \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: used and purchased marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from October 2007 to April 2018; used hallucinogenic (not alleged, but \nimplied) mushrooms on two occasions in or around April 2012 and November 2017; and \nstated to a defense investigator during his background interview that if he were offered \nmarijuana in the future, he might use it. (See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c.) \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed the full scope of his illicit drug use when he completed his \nSeptember 2018 SCA. His marijuana use started while in high school in about 2008. He \nused marijuana approximately twice then. His marijuana use continued into his college \nyears where he used it approximately two to three times a week. The marijuana was \neither provided by a roommate or Applicant purchased it himself. He stopped using \nmarijuana in 2014 because he applied for a position which required pre-employment \ndrug testing. He was hired for the position. He was aware that his new employer \nmaintained a zero-tolerance drug policy. He abstained from marijuana use for about \nfour months, then began using it recreationally again about once to twice a year. His \nlast use of marijuana was in April 2018, before he began his current position. He \nexperimented by using hallucinogenic mushrooms on two occasions in 2012 and 2017. \nHe has not used them since that time. He met his wife while they both attended college. \nShe used marijuana at that time, but she no longer uses it. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1-2; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he stopped using all illegal controlled substances \nbecause of his current employment position and the realization that his past use was \nfoolish and irresponsible. He no longer associates with his friends who continue using \nmarijuana. He passed his employer\u2019s drug-screening test. He has no future intent to use \nillegal drugs and documented such intent in a written statement. He also clarified his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprevious statement to a defense investigator where he indicated he might use illegal \ndrugs in the future. He just meant that if marijuana was legalized under federal law and \nif its use was not prohibited under security clearance regulations, he might then use it in \nthe future. He further acknowledged that those conditions do not currently exist and he \nhas no intention to use marijuana in the future. He has not participated in any drug \ncounseling or treatment programs. (Tr. 23-24, 26, 29; GE 2; AE A-B) \n \n \nApplicant presented a letter from his work supervisor. His supervisor recognized \nApplicant as a trustworthy employee and highly dependable. He recommends granting \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. (AE C) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One condition is potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n \n(a) any substance misuse; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nAppellant used and purchased marijuana and used hallucinogenic mushrooms at \nvarious times between 2008 and 2018. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. After \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of his statement during his background investigation and his \nsubsequent written statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, I find that \nAG \u00b6 25 (g) does not apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use of mushrooms was infrequent. His marijuana use was \nmore frequent, but it ceased (as did all of his illicit drug use) in April 2018. He has \nexpressed his intent not to use it in the future and submitted that intent in writing. He no \nlonger associates with the friends with whom he was using marijuana. He \nacknowledged that his youthful use of marijuana and mushrooms was foolish and \nirresponsible. He has established an excellent reputation at work where he is valued \nand trusted employee. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. His nearly two years of abstinence, his \nwritten commitment to abstinence, and his distancing from his drug-associated friends \nare sufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s intent not to use in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) \napplies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s \nstatement. I also considered Applicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use drugs in the \nfuture. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nRobert E.

After she obtained employment in \nOctober 2017 with a Department of Defense (DOD) contractor, she employed two credit \nrestoration companies (CRC) to ensure the validity and amounts of her debts. She \nestablished a track record of debt payments to address her student loans and two other \ndelinquent debts. She mitigated security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 20, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On August 29, 2019, the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued \na statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On \nSeptember 18, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3)    \n \nOn November 26, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 12, 2019, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for December 23, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered six exhibits; there \nwere no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript \n(Tr.) 16-21; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE F) I granted Applicant\u2019s request for \nadditional time to submit documentation. On January 3, 2020, DOHA received a transcript \nof the hearing. On January 20, 2020, I received one post-hearing exhibit, which was \nadmitted into evidence without objection.

(HE 3) She wrote \u201cI admit, this account is no longer on my credit report and has been \nrestored\u201d for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. She also wrote, \u201cI admit, this \naccount is no longer in delinquent [status] on my credit report and has been restored\u201d for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x. She provided extenuating and mitigating information for several \nother SOR allegations. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old security receptionist employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2017. (Tr. 5-6) In 2005, she received a General Education Diploma (GED),  \nand she received an associate\u2019s degree in human services that same year. (Tr. 5-6) In \n2012, she received a license for massage therapy. (Tr. 6) In 2011, she married and her \ndaughter is 25 years old. (Tr. 7-8) She has never served in the military. (Tr. 6) \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant was unemployed or under employed from March 2011, to May 2012, \nfrom November 2013, to August 2014, and from March 2016, to October 2017. (Tr. 5, 21-\n24; GE 1; GE 5 at 4) Applicant timely filed and paid her federal and state income taxes. \n(Tr. 47-48) \n \nThe debts listed in the SOR are documented in her SCA, credit reports, or her \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), or in more than \none of these documents. (GE 1-5) The SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts totaling $52,588. \nAfter subtracting the three withdrawn SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.q, and 1.u, 21 \ndelinquent debts totaling $47,624 remain, and their status is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $12,866 for a charged-off debt. Applicant \nand her husband financed a vehicle in 2011 as a joint account. (Tr. 24-25; GE 4 at 4) \nThey were unable to afford the payments, and they had the vehicle voluntarily \nrepossessed in 2012. (Tr. 24-25; GE 5 at 4) The date of the last payment is September \n2015. (GE 4 at 4) Applicant\u2019s spouse is the primary account holder, and Applicant has \nresponsibility as a joint account holder. (AE G at 2) Two months before her hearing, \nApplicant said as soon as the account and creditor are located, she and her husband \nintended to \u201crectify\u201d the debt. (Tr. 25-26) After her hearing, Applicant\u2019s husband provided \na letter in which he agreed to pay this debt. (AE G at 6-7) On January 6, 2020, the creditor \nwrote that Applicant\u2019s husband agreed to pay the creditor $214 per month beginning \nJanuary 15, 2020, until the balance is paid in full. (AE G at 2, 9) On January 7, 2020, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse paid the creditor $215. (AE G at 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $2,312. \nApplicant left an apartment before her lease ended. (Tr. 27) She made $50 payments in \nSeptember, October, and November 2019. (Tr. 27-28; AE F) Her November 15, 2019 \ncredit report indicates a different collection agent than the SOR, a balance of $2,511, and \nin the comments, it states that the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4 at \n2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $2,083 for a charged-off debt. She rented- \nto-buy a dinette set in October 2016, and her most recent payment was made in May \n2017. (Tr. 28; AE C; AE G at 12) A print out from the creditor indicates that from October \n2016, to May 2017, Applicant and her spouse made eight payments totaling $1,144. (AE \nG at 13) Her November 15, 2019 credit report stated that the joint account was based on \na rental agreement, and the account balance was $2,083. (GE 4 at 4) The original debt \nwas $2,975, and as of November 7, 2018, Applicant and her spouse owed $1,100. (AE \nG at 12) On January 2, 2020, Applicant wrote the creditor seeking information about the \ndebt. (AE G at 11) On January 10, 2020, the creditor confirmed the balance owed is \n$1,061. (AE G at 1-2) Applicant\u2019s husband accepted responsibility for this debt, and he \nsaid he intend to resolve this debt with one payment. (AE G at 6) If Applicant\u2019s husband \ndoes not pay this debt, Applicant said she intends to pay it. (AE C)  \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant has a telecommunications debt placed for \ncollection for $1,964. Her November 15, 2019 credit report indicates a balance of $1,964, \nand in the comments, it states that the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4 \nat 2) On January 7, 2020, Applicant agreed to a payment plan the creditor proposed to \nmake monthly $30 payments beginning on January 15, 2020, until the debt is paid. (AE \nG at 14) She intends to pay this debt. (AE C)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant has a medical debt placed for collection for \n$1,686. She incurred the debt in July 2013. She said at her hearing that she had not \ncontacted the creditor or made payments. (Tr. 29-30) Applicant used CRC2 to establish \nthe amount of the debt. (AE C) Applicant and the creditor agreed upon a $35 monthly \npayment plan to address a debt for $1,686. (AE G at 16-18) On January 15, 2020, she \nmade a $35 payment to the creditor. (AE G at 25) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant has a telecommunications debt placed for \ncollection for $1,287. Applicant\u2019s May 2019 credit report lists this debt. (Tr. 30; GE 3 at 2) \nShe has not contacted the creditor or made payments. (Tr. 21) Applicant said the debt \nwas removed from her credit report. (AE C)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant has a medical debt placed for collection for \n$1,067. Applicant was in a vehicle accident, and on December 19, 2019, her attorney \npaid this debt. (Tr. 30-31; SOR response) \n  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.m, and 1.n allege that Applicant has three medical debts placed for \ncollection for $840, $389, and $375, and they are owed to the same creditor. Applicant \nsaid the debts were removed from her credit report through the assistance of CRC2. (Tr. \n32, 35-36) She believed that she previously paid these three debts. (Tr. 33)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $690. Applicant \nmade four payments of either $35 or $53. (Tr. 33-34; AE E) Applicant and the creditor \nagreed on a $34 monthly payment plan in November 2019 to address a $637 debt. (AE \nG at 23) She made the first payment; the current balance is $603; and future payments \nwill be automatically debited from her bank account. (AE G at 23) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k allege that Applicant has two medical debts placed for \ncollection by the same collection agent for $491 and $486. Applicant did not recognize \nthe collection agent, and CRC2 said the two debts did not appear on her current credit \nreport. (Tr. 35) CRC2 did not have any information about this creditor. (Tr. 35) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $406. At her \nhearing, Applicant said she has not made any payments because she is using CRC2 to \nconfirm the correct amount of the debt. (Tr. 36; AE C) Her November 15, 2019 credit \nreport indicates a bank-originated debt, a balance of $406, and in the comments, it states \nthat the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4 at 2) On January 16, 2020, she \nmade a $150 payment to the creditor. (AE G at 25) On January 16, 2020, the creditor \nwrote that the debt had a zero balance and was resolved. (AE G at 15) \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges that Applicant has a charged-off debt for $4,827. Applicant had \nan account with the creditor, and the debt may have resulted from the purchase of \nfurniture. (Tr. 36-37; GE 5 at 4) She was unfamiliar with the amount of the debt. (Tr. 37) \nShe has not contacted the creditor or made any payments. (Tr. 37) \n \nDepartment Counsel withdrew the following SOR allegations: \u00b6 1.p, a debt placed \nfor collection for $1,964; \u00b6 1.q, a charged-off debt for $689; and \u00b6 1.u, a debt placed for \ncollection for $2,311. (Tr. 13-14, 29; HE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r alleges that Applicant has a charged-off medical debt for $1,685. \nApplicant is utilizing CRC2 to establish the amount of the debt. (Tr. 37; AE C) Once the \namount of the debt is established, and she has paid some other debts, she intends to pay \nthis debt. (Tr. 37; AE C) She has not made any payments to the creditor. (Tr. 37)   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t allege that Applicant has two student loan debts that are 120 \ndays past due for $8,360 and $3,798. A September 18, 2019 statement from the creditor \nindicates two student loans for $3,891 and $4,854 were addressed through $90 monthly \npayments for more than one year. (SOR response) An October 15, 2019 statement from \nthe creditor indicates two student loans for $3,597 and $8,299 were addressed through \n$135 monthly payments for eight months. (SOR response) Her student loans are current. \n(Tr. 37-38)   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.x allege that Applicant has two medical debts that were placed \nfor collection for $1,167 and $99. Applicant did not make any payments to the two \ncreditors. (Tr. 38) Her November 15, 2019 credit report comments for the debt in \u00b6 1.v \nthat the Applicant disputes the account information. (GE 4 at 2, item 2) She did not \nrecognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x; it is not listed on her November 15, 2019 credit report; \nand she believed it was deleted from her credit report. (Tr. 38; GE 4; AE C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.w alleges that Applicant has one medical debt placed for collection for \n$746. Applicant utilized CRC2 to establish the amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.w. (AE C) \nOn January 15, 2020, she made a $35 payment to the creditor.   \n \nApplicant had a medical debt for $890 placed for collection in September 2019. \n(AE G at 22) She was credited with a payment for $267 in August 2019. (Id.) She made \na $26 payment on January 2, 2020, and the current balance is $597. (Id. at 20-22) The \ncollection agent is not shown on her November 15, 2019 credit report, and there is \ninsufficient evidence to connect this debt to any of the debts alleged on her SOR. (GE 4)  \n \nApplicant made a $39 payment to another collection agent on January 15, 2020. \n(AE G at 25) The collection agent is not shown on her November 15, 2019 credit report, \nand there is insufficient evidence to connect this debt to any of the debts alleged on her \nSOR. (GE 4)  \n \nOn December 17, 2019, a collection agent informed Applicant that she had a \n$3,329 medical debt placed for collection. (AE G at 19) The collection agent is not shown \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \non her November 15, 2019 credit report or SOR. (GE 4) There is insufficient evidence to \nconnect this debt to any of the debts alleged on her SOR. (GE 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s November 15, 2019 credit report indicates the following information: \n(1) she has a $15,947 debt with a scheduled payment of $498 on a 72-month payment \nplan that is current (GE 4 at 2-3); (2) her student loans with the following balances are \ncurrent: $8,265; $3,575; $4,827; and $3,869 (GE 4 at 3); (3) some of her student loans \nmay be duplications (GE 5 at 5);  (4) a vehicle loan with high credit of $18,431 was paid \nin September 2017 (GE 4 at 4-5); (5) the following 12 SOR debts are not listed: 1.e, 1.f, \n1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.w, and 1.x (GE 4); and (6) all of the SOR debts not \nlisted on her November 15, 2019 credit report except for SOR \u00b6 1.f and 1.o are medical \ndebts.  \n \nApplicant employed two credit restoration companies (CRC1 and CRC2) to assist \nher in determining which debts on her credit report were valid. (Tr. 35-36; GE 5 at 3-4; \nAE G at 3-4) On September 18, 2019, and December 18, 2019, CRC2 listed the accounts \ncurrently disputed and already deleted from her credit report. (SOR response; AE B) It is \nnoteworthy that CRC2 is disputing some accounts that Applicant indicated at her hearing \nwere valid, such as her student loan accounts; however, she may be disputing the amount \nof the debt. She was unfamiliar with several of the debts that appeared on her credit \nreport. (Tr. 35-36) \n \nOn January 16, 2020, CRC2 wrote: \n \nAfter an extensive amount of research in assisting [Applicant] with accounts, \nwe learn[ed] there are several accounts listed which are either not \nbelonging, incorrect balance reporting and/or not primary account holder. \nThere are several accounts that we do not have knowledge of or access to, \nas they are not physically reporting on the current reports. We also do not \nhave any history or knowledge throughout any portion of her enrollment in \nour credit education program of any accounts below. The following accounts \nhave been contacted, [they either do not exist or they do not belong on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report]. (AE G at 4) \n \nCRC2 listed nine debts in the following SOR paragraphs as not substantiated: 1.w \n($746); 1.x ($99); 1.o $4,827); 1.f ($1,287); 1.j ($491); 1.k ($486); 1.m $389); 1.n ($375); \nand 1.h ($840). (AE G at 4) Applicant recently made a payment to address the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.w. \n \nApplicant and her husband share expenses. Her husband is employing training \ndrivers for delivery trucks. (Tr. 47) Applicant\u2019s budget provides the following monthly \ninformation: pay $3,010; expenses $1,062; rent $1,780; food $300; gas $200; and \nmiscellaneous items $150. (AE A) Her net remainder is a negative $482; however, her \nhusband agreed to pay $450 monthly to address the SOR debts and household expenses \nand to pay half of the rent once the family debts are paid. (AE G at 6) He also pays for \nvehicle loans, utilities, vehicle insurance, and his child support (Tr. 43; AE A; AG G at 6) \nHer spouse\u2019s gross monthly income is $3,846; however, he has worked for his current \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nemployer for only about five months. (AE G at 8) She may have miscalculated the amount \nof her spouse\u2019s contributions. Her budget shows monthly payments totaling $313 to \naddress SOR debts as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t, student loans ($228); SOR \u00b6 1.i, retail \naccount ($35); and SOR \u00b6 1.u, withdrawn ($50). She has allocated about 10 percent of \nher net income to address her SOR debts.  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin by marriage has known her for 14 years. (Tr. 51) He described \nher as honest, reliable, loyal, and trustworthy. (Tr. 51) He believes she will pay her debts \nand establish her financial responsibility. (Tr. 53) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. \n08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). The debts listed in the SOR are all documented in her SCA, \ncredit reports, or OPM PSI or in more than one of these documents. The record evidence \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2013), concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in resolving her debts warrants full application of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant\u2019s finances were damaged by underemployment and unemployment. Her \nfinancial problems resulted from circumstances largely beyond her control. She has a \ntrack record of paying her student loans, as shown by her payments addressing the \nstudent loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.u and the other debts on her credit report that are \ncurrent. Her attorney paid the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and she paid the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l.  She believed she paid the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.m, and 1.n, and they \nwere removed from her credit report. Her husband agreed to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c. I found her promise to resolve her unresolved debts to be credible. The Appeal \nBoard has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a \nfinancially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). The overall record of her \nfinancial history shows she has a track record of paying her debts, when she has the \nmeans to do so. \n \nTwo recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nand 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the Applicant had $41,000 in delinquent credit \ncard debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. \nShe filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. \nId. at 1-2. The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his payment of child support. The Appeal Board determined that AG \u00b6 \n20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment),\u201d even though that Applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. The Appeal Board also noted \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. However, it is important to indicate that Applicant has the burden \nof proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n  \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal \nBoard addressed a situation where an Applicant, who had been sporadically unemployed \nand lacked the ability to pay his creditors, observing that \u201cit will be a long time at best \nbefore he has paid\u201d all of his creditors. The Applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  The Applicant in ISCR Case No. \n08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment \nplan for the remaining debts; and (3) took \u201creasonable actions to effectuate that plan.\u201d Id. \nThe Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision because it did not \n\u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,\u201d emphasizing the Administrative \nJudge did \u201cnot explain[] what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under \nthe circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or \nwhy the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in light of his limited \ncircumstances.\u201d Id.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that several of her debts are in charged-off \nstatus. CRC1 and CRC2 disputed some debts, and they were removed from her credit \nreports. Eventually charged-off debts will be dropped from her credit report. \u201c[T]hat some \ndebts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.  \n \nDebts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe \nthe debts are not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting \ncompany\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been charged off. A debt may \nbe dropped from a credit report when it is in the process of being transferred to a collection \nagent. Applicant does not receive mitigating credit for debts that are charged off or \ndropped from her credit report unless they were invalid, paid, or settled. She continues to \nhave the responsibility to search her records and to contact the creditors to ascertain the \nstatus of the debts listed on the SOR. If she validates the debt, she has the security \nresponsibility of paying or settling the debt.  \n \nApplicant receives some mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 20(c). Although Applicant did \nnot provide proof that she completed financial counseling, she enrolled in CRC1 and \nCRC2. She also generated a budget. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by \ninsufficient income as a result of several years of unemployment and underemployment. \nApplicant established that she acted responsibly under the circumstances by making the \npayments she was able to make beginning in October 2017, when she received her \ncurrent employment.  \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or \nshe maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. Applicant loses some mitigating credit for failing to maintain contact with \nsome of her creditors.  \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for and is taking \nreasonable and responsible actions to resolve her remaining SOR debts, showing some \ngood faith and partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). The Appeal Board has previously \nexplained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant \nmust do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 \nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) (internal citation and footnote omitted)).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not fully applicable. CRC2 disputed most of the SOR debts. \nApplicant\u2019s November 15, 2019 credit report, the most recent credit report of record in \nthis case, does not list the following 12 SOR debts: 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, \n1.r, 1.w, and 1.x. All of the SOR debts not listed on her November 15, 2019 credit report \nexcept for SOR \u00b6 1.f and 1.o are medical debts. On December 17, 2019, a collection \nagent informed Applicant that she had a $3,329 non-SOR medical debt placed for \ncollection. (AE G at 19) As indicated previously, a debt that is dropped from a credit report \nmay still be a valid debt, and Applicant has the security responsibility of verifying with the \ncreditors the amount and status of her debts. She also has a security responsibility to \nresolve the non-SOR $3,329 medical debt. She indicated that she believed she paid some \nof the SOR debts that were dropped from her credit report; however, full mitigating credit \nis not warranted because she did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis \nof the dispute or provide[] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d as required in AG \u00b6 \n20(e).    \n \nIn sum, Applicant fell behind on her debts because of unemployment and \nunderemployment. Her student loans, her largest debt sector, are in established payment \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nplans, and do not appear on her current credit report as delinquent. She is making \npayments to address several additional SOR debts. She has multiple non-SOR debts in \ncurrent status, and one large non-SOR medical debt in collection status. Her attorney \npaid the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l. She believes she \nhas paid some other SOR debts, and some debts on her credit report are erroneous. Her \nhusband took responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. Because of her limited \nfinancial resources, she is taking reasonable and responsible actions to address her \ndebts. While more action is necessary to resolve all of her delinquent debts, her efforts \nare sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Assuming, financial \nconsiderations concerns are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20, security concerns are mitigated \nunder the whole-person concept, infra.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old security receptionist employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2017. In 2005, she received a GED and an associate\u2019s degree in human \nservices. In 2012, she received a license for massage therapy. In 2011, she married and \nher daughter is 25 years old. Applicant\u2019s cousin by marriage has known her for 14 years. \nHe described her as honest, reliable, loyal, and trustworthy. He believes she will pay her \ndebts and establish her financial responsibility. Her cousin\u2019s statement supports granting \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget shows monthly payments totaling $348 to address SOR debts \nas follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t, student loans ($228); SOR \u00b6 1.i, retail account ($35); SOR \n\u00b6 1.u, withdrawn ($50); and SOR \u00b6 1.w ($35). She has allocated about 10 percent of her \nnet income to address her SOR debts. Her attorney paid the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g \nfor $1,067, and Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l for $406. Her husband agreed to pay \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $12,866, and he made an initial $215 payment. He also agreed \nto pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $1,144 with a single payment once he has the funds \nsaved. Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report shows several accounts in current status. I \nam confident Applicant will continue to resolve her delinquent debts. She believes she \nhas paid other debts shown on the SOR as delinquent, and she did not recognize some \ndebts on the SOR, and they were disputed and removed from her credit report. In ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted), the Appeal \nBoard addressed a key component in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nApplicant understands how to budget and what she needs to do to establish and \nmaintain her financial responsibility. There is no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she \nhas established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-payment. I am confident she will \npay her delinquent debts because of her track record of financial progress shown over \nthe last two years. Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status \nat any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a \nclearance now does not bar the government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted.   \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns.   \n \n \n \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p and 1.q: \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u: \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.v, 1.w, and 1.x: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 19, 2017. On \nOctober 2, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent\nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016).\nApplicant answered the SOR on November 8, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n6, 2020, and the case was assigned to me on March 10, 2020. On the same day, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \n\n \n2 \n \nscheduled for March 30, 2020. On March 17, 2020, the hearing was cancelled because \nof DOD worksite and travel restrictions based on the health risks posed by the COVID-19 \nvirus.  \n \nOn July 24, 2020, DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing was rescheduled for \nSeptember 3, 2020. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until September 11, 2020, to enable him to submit additional documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AX G through N, which were admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX G through N are attached to the record \nas Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2020. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \nThe SOR originally alleged that Applicant was indebted to the federal government \nfor delinquent taxes of $23,000 for tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he failed to file, as \nrequired, federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). At the end of the hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 \n1.a to allege that Applicant was indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes \nof $21,000 for tax years 2013 and 2014. (Amendments in bold.) (Tr. 73-74.) Applicant did \nnot object to the amendment.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 70-year-old helicopter-modification manager employed by federal \ncontractors since September 2009. He holds a top secret clearance.  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from May 1972 to February 2004 and \nretired as a lieutenant colonel. He married in November 1969, divorced in October 1972, \nand has been married since June 1973. He has four adult children. After Applicant\u2019s \nretirement from the Marine Corps, he worked in law enforcement positions, and he was \na deputy sheriff in the city where he resided until he retired from that position in June \n2019. (Tr. 25; AX B.) \n \n \nIn June 2011, Applicant\u2019s son was seriously injured in an almost-fatal automobile \naccident. (Tr. 27.). In August 2011, Applicant\u2019s home was damaged by a hurricane. In \nspite of the hurricane damage and the emotional impact of their son\u2019s injuries, he and his \nwife timely filed their tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In November 2016, Applicant\u2019s home \nwas damaged by another hurricane. He testified that most of the records he needed to \nfile his tax returns were lost during this hurricane. He and his wife moved their remaining \nrecords to another location, where more records were lost during a hurricane in \nSeptember 2018. They did not file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 \n\n \n3 \n \nthrough 2018. Applicant testified that he and his wife failed to file tax returns for those \nyears because, \u201cWe were building things, things were going on in our life, and we were \njust getting overwhelmed and did not do it.\u201d (Tr. 51-53.) \n \n \nFor several years, Applicant\u2019s wife worked as a real estate agent. She worked as \nan independent contractor, and no taxes were withheld from her income. She did not file \nquarterly returns or pay estimated taxes on her income. (Tr. 35.) Until 2012, the tax \nwithholdings from Applicant\u2019s income were sufficient to pay the taxes due on their joint \nincome. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife started a team of realtors, and she began to earn \ncommissions on the sales of her team members. Applicant testified that he and his wife \nowed significant federal taxes for 2012, although he could not recall the amount. They \nentered into payment plans providing for payments of $400 per month to the IRS and \n$215 per month to the state tax authority, both by direct debit. (Attachments to SOR \nAnswer.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in June 2017, he disclosed that he had not filed \nhis federal tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016, because his home was flooded during \na hurricane and his financial records were destroyed. In June 2018, he was interviewed \nby a security investigator and he again disclosed his failures to file tax returns, citing the \nflood damage and destruction of his financial records. \n \n \nIn July 2019, DOHA sent Applicant tax interrogatories. He responded on August \n7, 2019, and stated that he owed $23,000 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2014. He also \ndisclosed that he had not filed federal income tax returns for 2015 through 2018 and had \nnot filed state tax returns for 2014 through 2018. \n \nOn August 6, 2019, the day before Applicant responded to the tax interrogatories, \nhe and his wife hired a tax attorney, who is also a certified public accountant, to prepare \ntheir federal and state income tax returns for 2013 through 2018 and to represent them \nwith the IRS and the state tax authorities regarding their tax liabilities for those years. As \nof the date of Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, his tax attorney had filed his federal and \nstate income tax returns for 2013 and 2014. (Attachments to SOR Answer.) As of the date \nof the hearing, his tax attorney had filed all state and federal tax returns through 2018, \nbut the IRS was still computing Applicant\u2019s tax debt for 2013 through 2018, and he had \nnot made any payments for those years. However, in August 2020, he made payments \nto the IRS and state tax authorities of estimated income taxes for tax year 2020, and he \nincreased the withholding of federal income taxes from his retired pay. (AX D.) At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he estimated his federal tax debt to be about $150,000 \nand his state tax debt to be between $30,000 and $35,000 (Tr. 59-60.). \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased their primary home in 2004 and have about \n$200,000 in equity. (Tr. 41.) They have owned another home since 1991, in which they \nhave equity of about $80,000 (Tr. 41.) Applicant owns a 2003 pickup truck which is fully \npaid for. His wife purchased a new car in 2019 for about $39,000, on which the monthly \npayments are about $609. He also owns a 2011 motorcycle that he purchased in 2015 \n\n \n4 \n \nfor $10,500, on which the payments are $235 per month. (Tr. 44.) He has about $4,000 \nin savings and investments (Tr. 45.) \n \nApplicant estimated that for the seven years since 2013, his wife\u2019s income has \nfluctuated from about $60,000 to $110,000. He testified that for every tax year since 2012, \nhe and his wife had joint income above $200,000. (Tr. 38.) He estimated that their net \nmonthly remainder each month is between about $8,000 and $10,000. (Tr. 65.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n5 \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax debts and repeated failures to timely \nfile his federal and state tax returns were recent, frequent, and did not occur under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s increased income was not a \ncircumstance beyond their control. The destruction of financial records in August 2011 \nhad no significant impact on his ability to file tax returns, and he timely filed his 2011 and \n2012 returns. He acted responsibly by making a payment agreement with the IRS for his \n2012 tax debt. The destruction of financial records in November 2016 occurred after he \nhad already failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for 2013 through 2015. \nHis failures to timely file his federal and state returns for 2016 may have been due to \nconditions largely beyond his control, but he provided no evidence explaining how the \ndestruction of his financial records in 2016 prevented him from timely filing his federal and \nstate tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He did not hire a lawyer until he was interviewed \nabout his tax delinquencies by a security investigator in June 2018 and received tax \ninterrogatories from DOHA in July 2019. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in \njeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing \nISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are not established. Applicant has obtained \nprofessional tax advice and has filed his past-due returns, but he is still facing a federal \ntax debt of about $150,000 and a state tax debt of at least $30,000, and he has no plan \nin place to resolve these tax debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established. Applicant has file his past-due returns but has \nnot yet begun paying the amounts due. However, the fact that he has filed his past-due \nreturns does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-\nenforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude \ncareful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has held a security clearance for many years. He deserves \ncredit for his many years of military service, but his repeated failures to comply with the \ntax laws is inexplicable in light of his years of living under military discipline in the U.S. \nMarine Corps. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), \nciting Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 \n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961) Applicant\u2019s repeated failures to fulfill his legal \nobligation to file federal and state tax returns indicate that he lacks the good judgment \nand reliability required of persons who are granted access to classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 14-04159 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2016). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his repeated failure to timely file his federal \nand state tax returns and pay the taxes due. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

His silence in failing to answer the amended SOR \u00b6 1.a. is considered a denial of that allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a security officer with his current employer since September 2017. He previously served with the U.S. Navy on active duty from April 1997 until May 2011, and in the U.S. Naval Reserve from May 2011 until July 2017, when he retired honorably as a leading petty officer (E-6).

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 12, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On August 23, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated October 7, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 31, 2019, \nand he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. As part of the FORM, pursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel \namended SOR \u00b6 1.a., and requested that he answer the amended subparagraph as part \nof the response to the FORM. Applicant received the FORM on November 7, 2019. His \nresponse was due on December 7, 2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, \nfor as of January 3, 2020, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me \non January 3, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). His silence \nin failing to answer the amended SOR \u00b6 1.a. is considered a denial of that allegation. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a security officer with his current employer since September 2017. He previously \nserved with the U.S. Navy on active duty from April 1997 until May 2011, and in the U.S. \nNaval Reserve from May 2011 until July 2017, when he retired honorably as a leading \npetty officer (E-6). His is a 1995 high school graduate. He was granted a secret clearance \nin 2013. He was married in 2000. He has three biological children, born in 1996 and 2001, \nas well as two adopted children, born in 2008 and 2009.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated April 26, 2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July \n16, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 23, 2019); and Item 2 \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated October 7, 2019).  \nApplicant noted that upon retiring in July 2017, he was unemployed for two months \nuntil he was able to obtain his current employment. During that brief period, he spent time \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nworking on home projects. His financial needs were taken care of by his terminal leave \nsalary and his wife\u2019s salary. (Item 4, at 5) He attributed his financial problems to a variety \nof factors: he was not always financially responsible; during 2015 or 2016 while he was \naboard ship, because of a medical issue and missed work, his wife failed to make some \nmonthly mortgage payments; and on a rental property, he was unable to find stable and \nconsistent tenants. (Item 4, at 8-10)  \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged four delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$243,000, as set forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a mortgage loan on his current residence \nthat was initially charged off but eventually foreclosed with an unpaid balance of $162,358 \n(Item 5, at 1; Item 4, at 9); SOR \u00b6 1.b. is a second mortgage loan on his current residence \nthat had an unpaid balance of approximately $74,000, of which nearly $17,000 was past \ndue, and was eventually foreclosed, leaving an unpaid deficiency balance of nearly \n$17,000 (Item 6, at 5, 8; Item 5, at 2; Item 4, at 9-10); SOR \u00b6 1.c. is an unspecified type \nof account with an unpaid balance of nearly $43,000 that was charged off (Item 6, at 10; \nItem 5, at 2; Item 4, at 9); and SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a mortgage loan on a former rental property \nwith an unpaid balance of over $409,000 that was foreclosed, leaving an unpaid \ndeficiency balance of nearly $21,000. (Item 6, at 5; Item 5, at 1; Item 4, at 10) \nApplicant acknowledged that he also had financial difficulties associated with a \nresidence where he lived from 2003 until 2011, but that he was able to save the property \nfrom foreclosure by selling the property at a short sale. \nIt is noted that despite Applicant\u2019s inability to maintain the four accounts alleged in \nthe SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, he managed to take \ntwo personal trips, outside of government travel, to the Bahamas for six to ten days in \nNovember 2017, and again to the Bahamas for one to five days in December 2017. (Item \n4, at 7)   \nApplicant contends that his mortgage is currently paid up to date, and that he is \nable to make all payments on time. His current residence is the same one that was \npreviously foreclosed, and he did not offer any explanation as to how the property was \nretrieved from foreclosure. (Item 3, at 9; FORM Receipt, dated November 7, 2019) Other \nthan Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions regarding his expenses and his efforts to resolve \ncertain delinquent accounts, there is no documentary evidence to support that Applicant \nmade any efforts to address any of his delinquent accounts. In the absence of \ndocumentation, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts have not been resolved. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged four delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$243,000, Applicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain those accounts in \na current status. As of the date the record closed, he had not resolved any of those \ndelinquent accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no \nevidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to \ndo so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant has attempted to \nattribute his financial problems to a variety of factors: he was not always financially \nresponsible; during 2015 or 2016 while he was aboard ship, because of a medical issue \nand missed work, his wife failed to make some monthly mortgage payments; and on a \nrental property, he was unable to find stable and consistent tenants. It is troubling that \nalthough Applicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a \ncurrent status, he managed to take trips to the Bahamas in 2017. \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in March 2018; underwent his OPM interview in January 2019; and \nthe SOR was issued in August 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process \nplaced him on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. Other than \nhis unverified claim that he is residing in a residence that was previously foreclosed, and \nthat his account is current, he offered zero documentary evidence to either support his \nclaim, or to reflect that he had made any efforts to resolve the other delinquent accounts. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant did not even promise \nto resolve his foreclosed or charged off debts. \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsecurity officer with his current employer since September 2017. He previously served \nwith the U.S. Navy on active duty from April 1997 until May 2011, and in the U.S. Naval \nReserve from May 2011 until July 2017, when he retired honorably as a Leading Petty \nOfficer (E-6). His is a 1995 high school graduate. He was granted a secret clearance in \n2013. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant had four delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$243,000. Although he claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in \na current status, he managed to take two personal trips, outside of government travel, to \nthe Bahamas for six to ten days in November 2017, and again to the Bahamas for one to \nfive days in December 2017. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s unverified claim that his mortgage is current, despite its \nprevious foreclosure, there is no documentary evidence to indicate that any of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent accounts have been addressed. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at \nbest. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esq. \n08/12/2020 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for access to classified information due to her family ties to China. A U.S. \nresident since 1991 and a U.S. citizen since 2002, Applicant met her burden to present \nsufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern for foreign \ninfluence based on her family ties to China. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non July 11, 2018. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. She provided a sworn affidavit in November 2018. (Exhibit 3) She provided \nwritten answers to interrogatories in June 2019. (Exhibit 2) Thereafter, on December 12, \n2019, \nthe \nDefense \nCounterintelligence \nand \nSecurity \nAgency, \nConsolidated \nAdjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons \n(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to \na complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines \nknown as Guideline B for foreign influence due to her family ties to China, the country of \nher birth, Guideline M for misuse of information technology, and Guideline E for \npersonal conduct. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 30, 2019. She admitted the SOR\u2019s \nfactual allegations with explanations detailed in two-page memorandum. She also \nrequested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to an administrative judge on February 21, 2020. The \nhearing was previously scheduled to occur on March 23 and then April 23, 2020. It was \npostponed on both occasions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nOn July 14, 2020, Department Counsel amended the SOR by withdrawing the \nallegations concerning misuse of information technology and personal conduct. (Tr. 9-\n10) Accordingly, those matters were no longer germane to the case and were not \nlitigated during the hearing. \nThe hearing took place as scheduled on July 29, 2020, which was the same day \nthe case was assigned to me due to unavailability of the assigned judge. Both \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted \nas Government Exhibits 1-4 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A-L. Post-hearing, Department \nCounsel offered Exhibit 5 to establish Applicant\u2019s security clearance history, and it is \nadmitted without objection. \nI took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of certain \nfacts concerning the country of China per Department Counsel\u2019s written request. \n(Exhibit 4) The essential facts about China are discussed below. The hearing transcript \n(Tr.) was received on August 7, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain or retain a security \nclearance for her job as a software developer with a consulting firm.

She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002, and \nshe obtained a U.S. passport. Upon becoming a U.S. citizen, she swore an oath of \nallegiance to the United States, thereby renouncing all allegiance and fidelity to China \nand any other foreign country.

E.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02960 (May 13, 2019) at 3 n. 3. Her Chinese \npassport had previously expired and she destroyed it after obtaining U.S. citizenship. \nShe has not returned to China since departing there in 1991, because she has \u201cno \ninterest\u201d in doing so. (Tr. 33-34) \nApplicant married in 1992; her spouse was also from China; and they divorced in \n2007. She has not remarried. She has two children from the marriage. (Exhibit K) Both \nare native-born U.S. citizens. (Exhibit C) Both are now college students, ages 21 and \n18. And both continue to live with her in the same home she has owned since 1999. \nThe SOR concerns Applicant\u2019s family ties to China via her mother, brother, and \nsister-in-law. The relevant details are set forth below. \nApplicant\u2019s father is not alleged in the SOR as he passed away in 2017. He had \nbeen long retired from his employment as an aerospace engineer with a research \ninstitution. Before he passed, Applicant typically had weekly contact (once or twice per \nweek) with her father by telephone calls, video chats, or texting. The last time she saw \nher father in-person was in August 1991 when she left China. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, age 82, is long retired from her employment as an electrical \nengineer with a manufacturing company. Applicant typically had weekly contact (once or \ntwice per week) with her mother by telephone calls, video chats, or texting. Applicant \nexplained during the hearing that she has reduced her contact with her mother to \nmonthly due to the Government\u2019s concern about her family ties to China. (Tr. 25-26) \nShe does not provide financial support to her mother, although she understands her \nbrother does. The last time she saw her mother in-person was in August 1991 when she \nleft China. \nApplicant\u2019s brother is employed as a civil engineer with a contracting and \nengineering company. Applicant typically had weekly contact with her brother by phone \ncalls, video chats, or texting, although such contact has also been reduced. The last \ntime she saw her brother in-person was in May 2015, when he visited her over a \nweekend while in the United States on a business trip. \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is not employed outside the home and is a full-time \nhomemaker. Applicant has the same level of contact with her sister-in-law as she has \nwith her brother. Applicant has never met her sister-in-law in-person. \nApplicant\u2019s family in China is unaware of the specifics of her employment, and \nthey are unware of any security clearance matters. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests are in the United States. In addition to her annual \nsalary of about $150,000, she has the following financial assets here: (1) her home with \na market value of about $1.2 million with a mortgage loan balance of about $77,000; (2) \nabout $300,000 in a brokerage account; and (3) about $200,000 in cash in credit union \naccounts. (Exhibits D, E, and F) She has no financial or business interests in China, nor \ndoes she have any financial accounts in China. \n3 \n\n \n \nConcerning the country of China, Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice contains an extensive discussion of the security concerns \nassociated with China. (Exhibit 4) The essential facts about China are the following: (1) \nChina is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount \nauthority; (2) China (along with Russia) is the most aggressive collector of intelligence \n(both industrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China \nhas a poor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, \nrespect for civil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency \nin government, worker rights, as well as discrimination, societal abuses, and human \ntrafficking. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance). \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n4 \n\nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to China should disqualify her from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of China. Suffice it to say, the \nU.S. Government views the behavior of the Chinese government as presenting a \nserious national security concern. The heightened-risk element is easily satisfied. Given \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to China, the Government has established its case under \nGuideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b) \n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. \nChina\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy \nperson. She was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. She appears to have \ncooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process. \nShe made a good impression upon me during the hearing. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China. Applicant came to the \nUnited States nearly 30 years ago in 1991. She has since established and made her life \nhere. After earning a master\u2019s degree, she has had a long employment record in the \nUnited States. She gave birth to two children in the United States, and her adult children \nare pursing their lives and educations in the United States. Her financial assets (her \nestimated net worth is more than $1 million) are exclusively in the United States. \nAlthough her family ties to China still count and cannot be dismissed out of hand, the \nstrength of those ties are diminished due to distance and time (the passage of nearly 30 \nyears since she departed China and has never returned). On balance, her ties to the \nUnited States are much stronger than her now distant and largely nominal family ties to \nChina. \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who \nhave Chinese citizenship. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States that she can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \n6 \n\n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 12, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 31, 2020.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on February 14, \n2020, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 6, 2020.  The Government \noffered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2 which were admitted \nwithout objection. The Applicant offered eight exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A through H, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his \n\n \n \n2 \n \nown behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 16, 2020.  After \nthe record closed, Applicant submitted a letter dated April 3, 2020, to supplement his \ntestimony.  Department Counsel noted her objection.  In all fairness to the Applicant, the \ndocument, even though submitted untimely, will be admitted into evidence as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit I.  Department Counsel\u2019s objection is overruled.     \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of Israel.  Department Counsel provided a six page summary of the facts, \nsupported by twelve Government documents pertaining to Israel, identified as \nGovernment Exhibit HE1.  The documents provide elaboration and context for the \nsummary.  Applicant had no objection.  I took administrative notice of the facts included \nin the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old and is married a second time.  He has two daughters \nfrom his first marriage, and a son from his current marriage.  He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in Engineering.  He holds the position of Manufacturing Engineer with a defense \ncontractor.  A security clearance is required in connection with this employment.        \n  \n \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  Applicant has lived \na nomadic life.  He has an extensive history of moving back and forth from Israel to the \nUnited States and Canada motivated by economic opportunities.  Applicant was born in \nIsrael in 1958.  In 1974, at the age of sixteen, he and his parents and brother relocated \nfrom Israel to the United States.  They obtained their green cards and planned to stay in \nthe United States.  Applicant obtained his college education in the U.S., and in 1982, he \nbecame a naturalized United States citizen.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n \n \nIn 1983, Applicant moved back to Israel because he wanted to marry an Israeli \nwoman.  While a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant served in the Israeli Army from 1983 \nto 1987.  He married an Israeli woman in 1987.  Together, they had two daughters who \nwere born in Israel.  In 1990, Applicant returned to the United States, where he and his \nfamily lived until 1992/1993.  At that time, Applicant sponsored his daughters for United \nSates citizenship.  In 1993 or so, Applicant\u2019s wife convinced him that it would be better \nfor their family to move back to Israel to enable her parents to help with taking care of \ntheir children.  (Tr. p. 29.)  In about 1993, Applicant and his family moved back to Israel.  \nThey lived in Israel this time until 1996.  (Tr. p. 31.)  \n\n \n \n3 \n \n  \nIn 1996, Applicant and his family left Israel and moved to Canada for a job.  \nApplicant lived and worked in Canada for five years or so.  During his time in Canada, \nApplicant rented a residence there, saved his earnings, and purchase a home in Israel \nfor $230,000.  (Tr. p. 32.)  In late 1999, early 2000, Applicant left Canada, and once \nagain, moved his family back to live in Israel.  From 2000 to 2003, Applicant worked for \nthe Israeli Aircraft Industries in Israel.  By this time, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife \nwas deteriorating, and he decided to divorce her.  He then returned to the United \nStates.  He left his wife, the house, and their two daughters in Israel, who at that time \nwere 12 and 13 years old.  (Tr. p. 34.)  Applicant testified that following the divorce with \nhis wife, he continued to care for his daughters, by calling them, visiting them Israel, and \nbringing them presents.  Most noteworthy was a visit he made in 2006 when his \nyoungest daughter got into an argument with his ex-wife and was forced to leave the \nhouse.  Not wanting her to be alone, Applicant returned to Israel.  In 2007, he decided it \nbest to move back to Israel again, this time to give his daughter emotional support.  \nApplicant remained in Israel from 2007 until either 2010 or 2011.  While in Israel, \nApplicant met his current wife through the internet.  At the time, she lived in Belarus and \nis of Russian decent.  Two months after meeting her, she moved to Israel to be with the \nApplicant.  They were married in April 2010.  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n2016.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  Their son was born in Israel in October 2010.  (Tr. p. 38.)   \n \n \nWhile living in Israel, from November 2009 to December 2010, Applicant worked \nfor the Israeli government as an engineer for the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority, which is \nequivalent to the Federal Aviation Administration.  Applicant\u2019s job involved working with \naircraft engines and fuel systems, and to ensure that the airplanes engine met Israeli \nrequirements.  (Tr. p. 48.)  After a while Applicant became discontented with his job.  In \n2011 he left Israel, and moved back to Canada for another job.   \n \n \nIn 2012, Applicant returned to the United States with his current wife and son.    \nIn 2014, Applicant purchased a home in the United States, where he has lived for the \npast six years.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  In 2016, he began working for his current \nemployer.  In 2018, he returned to Israel to attend one of his daughter\u2019s wedding.  (Tr. \np. 57.)                    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two daughters are now grown and married to medical professionals.  \nThey are both dual citizens of Israel and the United States.  One of them recently had a \nchild, and so Applicant has a new granddaughter.  Applicant maintains regular contact \nwith his daughters.  He talks to them by telephone every two weeks or so.  One of \nApplicant\u2019s daughters owns a home in Israel valued at $500,000.  Applicant states that \nhe provides no financial support to his family in Israel.   \n \n \nApplicant also maintains some contact with several friends and professional \nassociates who are residents and citizens of Israel.  These individuals are long-time \nfriends of the Applicant.  During their conversations, Applicant does not reveal any \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel.  He possesses a valid \nIsraeli passport that he uses when he travels to Israel.  Applicant stated that if he needs \nto renounce his citizenship and surrender his foreign passport, he is willing to do it in \norder to obtain a security clearance.        \n \n \nApplicant provided a Statement of Intent dated December 12, 2019, which \nindicates that he pledges to renounce his Israeli citizenship and destroy his passport \nwith no intention to renew them.  Should there be any violation with regard to that \nstatement of intent, he consents to automatic revocation of his security clearance.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  At the time of the hearing Applicant had not renounced his \nforeign citizenship nor had he surrendered his foreign passport.  \n \n \nA letter from the President of the company for whom Applicant works recognized \nApplicant\u2019s extraordinary team performance and achievements in 2018 for Program \nExcellence.  Applicant and his team were nominated for the company\u2019s Aerospace \nSystems President\u2019s Award.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)   \n \n \nApplicant received a certificate of appreciation from his employer for his hard \nwork and dedication.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \n \nI have taken administrative notice of background information concerning the \ncountry of Israel.  The State of Israel is a multiparty parliamentary democracy.  Israel\u2019s \nprime minister leads the executive branch of the government.  The United Sates is \nIsrael\u2019s leading trading partner.  Israel respects the rights of its citizens; however, there \nare some concerns about Israel\u2019s detention and interrogation of alleged terrorists, and \ndiscrimination against Arabs.  Terrorism is a continuing threat to Israel and American \ninterests in Israel.  Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close \nfriendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security \ninterests.  Occasionally, Israeli and American interests have diverged.  Several U.S. \ngovernment employees have been prosecuted for disclosure of classified information to \npersons connected to the Israeli government.  Israel has an active program to gather \nproprietary information from U.S. companies.    \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n\n \n \n5 \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \n\n \n \n6 \n \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 7 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns.  Three disqualifying conditions may apply:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S. that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country.   \n  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members include his two daughters and their husbands \nwho are citizens and residents of Israel, and several long-time friends and associates.  \nAlthough there are not many individuals that pose a security risk, of concern is the \nnature of the relationships he does have.  For most of his life, over a forty year period, \nand on a number of occasions, Applicant has traveled to and from Israel to live and \nwork.  Considering the fact that he now lives far away from his daughters, Applicant \nremains emotionally close to them, especially his younger one, and Israel holds a \nspecial place in his heart.  Applicant recently became a grandfather, and now has a new \ngranddaughter in Israel.  After becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant served in the Israeli \nmilitary forces, and worked for the Israeli government, specifically the Israeli Civil \nAviation Authority.  Applicant has a few long-time Israeli friends and or associates that \nhe continues to maintain relationships with.  He has an Israeli passport and maintains \nhis citizenship there.  Based upon Applicant\u2019s past history, he is tightly woven into the \nIsraeli culture.   \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s strong foreign connection with Israel raises some serious security \nconcerns.  Applicant is a target to be threatened or influenced or placed in a situation \nthat may manipulate or induce him to help a foreign person or foreign government in a \nway that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests.  Applicant has subjected himself to a \nheightened risk of foreign influence, or exploitation, or personal conflict of interest from \nhis connections with his relatives and friends in Israel.  Under the particular \ncircumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is applicable, and this contact poses a \n\n \n \n7 \n \nsecurity risk to the U.S. government that is not necessary.  The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 8 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns.  None of them apply to Applicant:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirement \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and  \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests  is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n  \nApplicant argues that under any circumstances his loyalties are to the United \nStates.  However, his actions speak louder than his words.  Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts \nwith his family and friends in Israel clearly pose a security risk.  Applicant has \nthroughout the past 40 years made some extraordinary moves; leaving the United \nStates on numerous occasions, and choosing to move to Israel to be close to his family \nthere.  Although his daughters are not directly associated with the Israeli government, \nApplicant is extremely close to his daughters.  When one of his daughters needed him \nemotionally, Applicant left the United States, and moved back to Israel to be close to \nher.  Since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has continued to maintain \nand nurture his relationship with the country of Israel, by serving in their Army and by \nworking for their government.  He has continued to maintain close contact with his \nfamily and close friends in Israel.   \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nIt is noted that Applicant first came to the United States with his parents and he \nattended college.  After doing so, however, he has returned to Israel several times.  He \nwent there to marry and establish his family, to work, to purchase a home, and to serve \nin the Israeli military.  Another time he followed his family when they wanted to move \nback.  Another time, he returned to Israel, initially to provide emotional support to his \ndaughter, and decided to move there again.  These obvious deep emotional \nconnections to Israel present the potential for divided allegiance between the U.S. and \nIsrael.  Full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has not been established.  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign relationships poses a heightened security risk.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s strong familial ties and foreign connections in Israel pose a significant \nrisk to the U.S. government.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this \nregular ongoing contact with these foreign nationals creates an unnecessary security \nrisk not worth the benefit to the U.S. government.      \n   \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINT APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is n\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibilit\nand a security clearance.
