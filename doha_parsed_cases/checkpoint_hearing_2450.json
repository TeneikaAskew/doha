DOHA received the hearing transcript on March 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He is a college graduate. He is twice divorced and \nmarried to his current wife since 2002. He has one adult biological child and two adult \nstepdaughters. He has five grandchildren. The grandchildren live close to him and his \nwife, and they provide support and care for them as needed. They see the grandchildren \nseveral times a week. Applicant is a father figure as there are no other males in the family. \n(Tr. 21-25, 79-80) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI). The breathalyzer registered .10%. He cooperated with police and was remorseful \nfor his conduct. Applicant was on a business trip and was out to dinner with his boss. He \nadmitted he had more drinks than he should have had. He has diabetes and did not take \nhis insulin that day. He testified that he did not feel impaired, but he used poor judgment \nin driving. He said he should have known better. He preaches to his children never to \ndrink and drive and felt like a hypocrite. Prior to the incident, he occasionally had alcoholic \ndrinks on a special occasion such as his birthday His last drink was on his last birthday in \nJuly. Due to his diabetes he rarely consumes alcohol because of its negative impact. He \ncredibly testified this was a one-time isolated incident. He acknowledged it was a terrible \nmistake. (Tr. 73-77, 83, 137-145) \nThe charge was reduced to reckless driving. Applicant completed a MADD victim \nimpact panel as part of his sentence and paid a fine. The charge was expunged from his \nrecord in September 2019. (AE N, O, P, Q, R) \nIn September 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony domestic \nbattery by strangulation. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that he grabbed his stepdaughter (SD) by the \nneck after she kicked and attempted to strike him. \nApplicant testified that he had loaned SD money and she came to his house \nuninvited. She was agitated and yelling at him. He asked her to pay the money she owed \nhim that was due that day. She refused and yelled profanity at him. According to \nApplicant, she then kneed him in the groin and punched him several times in the chest, \nneck and throat area. They engaged in a mutual altercation, shoving each other.

She \ntook a bottle that was accessible and hit him on the head. She then called the police, who \nresponded about an hour later, and Applicant was arrested and taken to jail. (Tr. 35-47; \n129-137, 157-159.) \nThe police report showed that SD made a sworn statement saying she had a verbal \naltercation with Applicant and then he attacked her by pushing her, taking hold of her \nthroat, held her against a doorway, and he placed her finger in his mouth and bit it. (AE \nE) \nSD provided a written statement in support of Applicant regarding the incident (and \nalso a 2013 incident). She stated that she provoked the argument and \u201cflew off the handle\u201d \nand the name calling began. (AE F) She stated: \nI was the one who provoked the incident by first slapping him and then \nkicking him in the groin. He was defending himself and I persisted which led \nto the incident where we both grabbed one another. I grabbed him and he \ngrabbed me. As we were pushing each other away we both ended up \ngrabbing each other by the throat. I tried to hook him in the mouth where \nmy finger became cut. I also hit him in the back of the head with a \nvase/bottle. (AE F) \nSD further stated that it was a horrible and tragic event that led to Applicant\u2019s \narrest. She acted immaturely and deeply regrets the incident. She discussed the incident \nwith the State attorney and the charges were dropped against Applicant. She described \nApplicant as a kind and loving man toward his children and grandchildren. She stated this \nwas an isolated incident and since the altercation she and her family have developed a \nnon-adversarial communication system to discuss issues. She and her stepfather are on \ngood terms and are embarrassed and ashamed about their past behavior. They love and \nsupport each other. After the incident they apologized to each other. (AE F) \nSD testified at the hearing. She refused to answer questions that raised issues \nabout her veracity based on the sworn statement she provided to police, her written \nstatement, and her testimony. I did not find her credible. (Tr. 191) \nSD testified that Applicant has been a father figure to her for the past 20 years. \nShe has been diagnosed with depression and said \u201cI basically am suicidal.\u201d (Tr. 172) She \nstated that she was responsible for starting the 2018 incident, it was her fault, and it was \nnot fair to him. She did not believe he bit her finger on purpose. She had the charges \ndropped because it was not fair to Applicant when she was the one who was wrong. She \nno longer needs Applicant\u2019s help financially. (Tr. 172-212) \nApplicant admitted it was an emotional incident. He took responsibility for his \nconduct. In October 2018, the State Attorney declined to prosecute the case after \nconsidering SD\u2019s statement, statements of witnesses, and the police report. The charges \nwere dropped.

It was alleged he was engaged in a physical fight with his son-in\u00ad\nlaw (SD\u2019s husband) after the son-in-law attempted to strike Applicant. The son-in-law \nalleged Applicant wielded a knife during the altercation. (GE 3, 4, 5; AE G) \nApplicant testified that SD was married to S at the time of the incident. SD has two \nchildren from another marriage. On the birth certificate of her third child, S is listed as the \nfather, but he is not the biological father. This child was three years old at the time of the \n2013 incident. SD called Applicant because she was afraid of S. He was attacking her \nand she was concerned for the safety of the children. Applicant described S as \nunpredictable due to his use of illegal drugs, including methamphetamine and alcohol. \nApplicant drove to SD and S\u2019s house. He did not call the police because he said the police \nhave never done anything in the past when SD called. He admitted he did not think to call \nthe police, but was acting on instinct. When he arrived at the house, Applicant observed \nS and SD tussling. He asked S what was the matter with him. Then S took a swing at him \nand the two began to fight. There is conflicting testimony and in written statements, SD \nsaid she was being attacked by S and was on the ground when Applicant arrived. At some \npoint, Applicant and S stopped fighting, and S called the police. Applicant stated that S \ngot the worst of it with a cut on his face and mouth. Applicant stated he was defending \nhimself. He then went outside and waited for the police to arrive. Applicant was arrested \nand put in jail. (Tr. 47-60 118-126, 160-163; AE G) \nS claimed that Applicant arrived at the house and charged him unprovoked, threw \nhim against the wall, and held a pocket knife to his throat. Applicant denied a knife was \ninvolved and none was retrieved as evidence. He said he does not own a pocket knife. In \nJanuary 2014, the State Attorney determined he would not file an information on the \ncharges. (Tr. 47-60; AE H) \nSD testified that she was being attacked by S and someone called the police. \nApplicant arrived and pulled S off of her and started to defend her. She did not see a knife \nduring the altercation. She stated that S had a drug problem and was in and out of \nrecovery. He was abusive and has been in other relationships where he was abusive. \nShe had two protective injunctions against him. (Tr. 178-186) \nApplicant admitted he could have done something to deescalate the situation by \nremoving SD from the house and calling the police. Through counseling, he is more aware \nof approaching a volatile situation with the premise of doing the right thing. S provided a \nstatement in his motion to dissolve an injunction for protection dated January 29, 2014. \nHis statement said that the incident was a misunderstanding with his \u201csoon to be ex-wife.\u201d \nHe said he did not want the incident to impact Applicant\u2019s job because he pays all of the \nbills and he didn\u2019t want the rest of the family to suffer. He stated he was sorry and never \nintended to waste anyone\u2019s time. A copy of a mug shot and booking record for a later May \n2019 arrest of S for a domestic violence violation; controlled substance \u2013 possession \nwithout a prescription; and possession of drug paraphernalia was provided, presumably \nto show S\u2019s character, but also to show the pose he struck for the photo.

The \nSOR alleged he struck his wife after she struck him during an argument. Although \nApplicant admitted the allegation in his SOR answer, at his hearing, he had no recollection \nof the incident. In his 2010 and 2011 interview with a government investigator, he \ndisclosed his wife hit him and he hit her back. She called the police. The charges were \ndropped by his wife and the court. He attended a battered women\u2019s course at a family \ncounseling center one night a week for about two months. This was not court ordered. At \nhis hearing, he denied he hit his wife. (Tr. 62-63, 106; GE 6, AE I) \nIn about May 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault \nwith a weapon. He was arrested after a motorist described a vehicle matching Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle and identified Applicant in a police line-up as the person who pointed the firearm \nat him from another vehicle. Applicant believes he was falsely identified. Applicant denied \nhe owned a firearm and none was found in his vehicle or retrieved from his house as \nevidence. He denied that he was involved in this altercation. Applicant and his wife were \nmoving that day and were together. He testified that he had lent his vehicle to his brother-\nin-law, who is similar in stature. He told this to his lawyer. His brother-in-law was never \nquestioned. Applicant explained that his lawyer told him that he had a 50-50 chance of \nwinning or losing the case, it would be expensive, and since he had a security clearance \nto not take any chances and plead no contest, which he did. The charge was nolle \nprosequi, and he participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to complete \n50 hours of community service. The charge was dismissed in 2004. (Tr. 63-71, 96-106, \n163; GE 4, 6; AE J) \nIn 1997, Applicant was charged with domestic battery. He could not recall the \nincident. The offense is not listed on Applicant\u2019s FBI report. Applicant admitted this \nallegation in his answer to the SOR. Court records show the offense was nolle prosequi \nin October 2001. (Tr. 71-73, 95-96; AE K) \nMore than ten years ago, Applicant participated in counseling associated with \nstress and completed the program. The facility does not retain records past ten years and \nhe could not recall the exact dates. He attended anger management classes in \napproximately 2004-2005 and marriage counseling during the same period of time. He \nindicated he gained valuable insight from the counseling. (Tr. 113-117; GE 3) \nIn November 2020, Applicant participated in an anger management assessment. \nThe assessment was done by a psychologist, who holds a Ph.D. and is a licensed marital \nand family therapist. Applicant stated that after receiving the SOR it prompted him to \nreach out to have the assessment. He did it on his own volition. The psychologist did not \nhave information about his past domestic violence allegations from Applicant\u2019s record, \nand Applicant did not provide it to her. Her opinion is based solely on psychological tests \nshe had Applicant complete. Applicant had high scores in areas that indicate a strong \nunderstanding and mastery of different skills sets, some of which manage and control \nanger, stress, and aggressive or disruptive behavior. He showed a low score in areas \nindicating little tendency to behave in an attacking manner and he had good boundary \nskills with others.

(Tr. 117, 153-155; AE M) \nApplicant saw a mental health therapist (JPD) in November 2020 who specializes \nin family counseling. JPD testified and was told by Applicant he needed an evaluation \nand letter for his security clearance issues. JPD found Applicant sincere, and they \ndiscussed Applicant\u2019s life traumas and coping mechanism. JPD was aware of some of \nApplicant\u2019s past issues, but not all of them. He was unaware of the 2018 allegations or \nthe more dated allegations. Applicant explained the reason he provided the 2013 incident \nwas because that was the one he remembered. Applicant did not disclose the other SOR \nallegations. JPD and Applicant had approximately eight counseling sessions. JPD opined \nthat Applicant had the tools to make good decisions and he accepted responsibility for \nhis actions. Applicant was provided tools for looking at things from a different perspective \nand coping mechanisms. JPD did not provide a formal diagnosis. He believed Applicant \nto be sincere and trusted him to make good decisions. (Tr. 145-153; 213-232; AE L) \nSince the last domestic violence incident in 2018, Applicant said there have been \nfamily changes. LM is divorced from S, which caused great strife within the family. He \ndoes not visit and is not part of their lives. Applicant has had a more active positive role \nin helping raise his grandchildren.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested in 2019 and charged with DUI. His BAC was .10%. The \nevidence supports the application of the above disqualifying condition. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nApplicant does not have a history of alcohol abuse. He was arrested once for DUI, \nin 2019, which was reduced to reckless driving. The offense was expunged from his \nrecord. He completed a victim impact course and paid a fine. He acknowledged he made \na horrible mistake. He infrequently consumes alcohol. Applicant\u2019s conduct is unlikely to \nrecur and it happened under unique circumstances. It does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. The above mitigating condition applies. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was arrested and charged five times from 1997 to 2018 on various \naggravated assault, battery, domestic violence offenses, and in 2019 for DUI. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe evidence confirms that Applicant has been arrested numerous time. The \narrests from 1997, 2002 and 2004 are dated, but establish a pattern of criminal conduct \nwhen combined with the arrests from 2013, 2018, and 2019. \nThere is scant evidence regarding the 1997 arrest for engaging in a dispute with \nhis then wife. The battery charge was nolle prosequi in 2001. He is no longer married to \nher. The 2002 arrest and charge of aggravated battery is for his alleged behavior toward \na motorist. Applicant may have had an alibi defense, but he pleaded no contest and \naccepted a pretrial diversion agreement. He completed the terms and the charge was \nlater dismissed. \nApplicant and his wife engaged in a mutual altercation in 2004 and the battery \ndomestic violence charge was dropped. Applicant participated in counseling and attended \nprograms to teach him how to manage his emotional issues. The evidence supports he \nwas successful in doing so and there were no additional incidents involving his wife. \nAlthough these were serious charges, it appears for the 1997 and 2004 charges, that both \nparties bear responsibility in their conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe more recent charges occurred in 2013 and 2018 and both involved LM, \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter. Based on her testimony, demeanor, and conduct during the \nhearing, it is apparent that she can become emotional and escalate situations. I found \nApplicant\u2019s testimony credible in that he went over to SD\u2019s house to help her when S \nbecame physically aggressive. Applicant was attempting to protect SD and her children.\nHe and S were mutual combatants. It is apparent that Applicant could have handled the \nsituation differently. He took responsibility for his conduct, waited for the police, and the \ncharges were later dropped.  \n \nRegarding the 2018 incident, SD took responsibility for starting the fight with \nApplicant, which quickly got out of control. Her testimony at the hearing contradicted her \nsworn statement to the police. She refused to answer questions about providing false \ninformation. I did not find her credible. I believe Applicant was telling the truth in that she \nwas angry with him because she was overdue on her loan payment, and he questioned \nher about it. She attacked him and he fought back and protected himself. I believe he bit \nher finger because she put it in his mouth. I believe both are embarrassed about their \nconduct and have reconciled. The charges were later dropped because there was \ninsufficient reliable evidence to prosecute it. \nIt is common in domestic violence cases for the alleged victim to withdraw their \ncomplaint or refuse to testify and the charges get dropped. It is also common that \nsometimes the parties are equally at fault, but only one is arrested. Applicant is not free \nfrom fault in the incidents where he was criminally charged, but a review of all of the facts, \nindicate that he was not the aggressor in the 2013 and 2018 incidents. His last incident \nof aggression was in 2004 and his reckless driving offense was in 2019. It appears he \nhas done some soul searching and has found better ways to deal with potentially volatile \nsituations. There is considerable evidence as to his good character. It appears he and SD \nhave found more amiable ways to communicate. S is no longer in her life. Applicant has \nattended counseling. I give some weight to his counseling with JPD because he was \nprovided with tools on handling volatile situations, but it is noted that the therapist was \nunaware of all of Applicant\u2019s past conduct. I am satisfied that Applicant has reflected on \nhis past conduct and has found appropriate tools to use in the future. Despite Applicant\u2019s \narrest history, I believe it is unlikely he will be involved in similar behavior in the future. I \nbelieve there is sufficient evidence of rehabilitation based on a review of Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence and devotion to his job and work performance. The above mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nApplicant was charged with DUI and convicted of reckless driving. He was arrested \nfive times from 1997 to 2018, and charged with aggravated assault and battery primarily \nrelated to domestic violence raising questions about his conduct and judgment. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nI have addressed the security concerns under Guidelines G and J and the same \nanalysis applies under Guideline E. Applicant\u2019s arrest for DUI was an isolated incident, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand I find there are no security concerns regarding his alcohol consumption. Although, he \nhas a history of arrests primarily dealing with domestic violence, I believe the evidence \nsupported that the more recent incidents involved him protecting his stepdaughter and \nwhere she was the aggressor. He has acknowledged his behavior, attended counseling \nand has found a better way to communicate with his family. Sufficient time has passed \nand I believe future conduct of this nature is unlikely to recur. The above mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, G, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s past is checkered with arrests for domestic violence. I have considered \nall of the evidence. I believe Applicant now has the necessary emotional maturity and \nskills to interact with family members appropriately. He understands the importance of \nremaining in control when others are not. Although he was not the aggressor in the two \nmore recent instances, he knows that he could have reacted differently. He has been \nproactive in addressing how to prevent future problems and deescalate a hostile situation. \nI have considered all of the evidence, and I believe Applicant has met his burden of \npersuasion. He should be acutely aware that any future misconduct, no matter how small \nor insignificant, could result in reexamination of his security worthiness. The record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, \nand Guideline E, personal conduct. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a : \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all the allegations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at his present job in August 2018. He is an engineer and worked for other federal contractors from 1993 to 2012. He has a master\u2019s degree and is working towards completing a PhD program. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1977 to 1979 when he was honorably discharged. He is divorced (his previous marriage was from 1987-2004). He has three adult children. He previously held a security clearance. (GE 2) The SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 2012, which was dismissed for his failure to make the required plan payments. It also alleged an unpaid judgment against Applicant in the amount of $10,079. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) Bankruptcy court records (case # 12-05360-jw), a LexisNexis state judgment and lien filings document, and Applicant\u2019s answers to his August 2018 security clearance application (SCA) establish the allegations. (GE 2, 5, 6) Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that in December 2012, Applicant was debarred from a military installation where he both lived and worked.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 17, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations \nand Guideline E, personal conduct. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 20, 2020, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. I was assigned the case on April 5, 2022.

Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-K, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record remained open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He submitted AE L-U, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 2, 2022. \nEvidentiary Ruling \nApplicant moved (in limine) to suppress a sworn statement made to military police \nauthorities by Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend (GF) on August 25, 2012, on the basis of not being \nable to cross examine GF about the statement. I denied the motion, but I also indicated \nthat I would consider what weight I would give the statement based upon all the facts and \ncircumstances presented upon the close of all the evidence. Having reviewed all the \nevidence in the case, I have decided to give GF\u2019s statement no weight because I deem it \nunreliable given the circumstances of the case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the allegations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, \nI make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in August 2018. He is an engineer and worked for other federal contractors \nfrom 1993 to 2012. He has a master\u2019s degree and is working towards completing a PhD \nprogram. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1977 to 1979 when he was honorably \ndischarged. He is divorced (his previous marriage was from 1987-2004). He has three \nadult children. He previously held a security clearance. (GE 2) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection in August 2012, which was dismissed for his failure to make the required plan \npayments. It also alleged an unpaid judgment against Applicant in the amount of $10,079. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) Bankruptcy court records (case # 12-05360-jw), a LexisNexis state \njudgment and lien filings document, and Applicant\u2019s answers to his August 2018 security \nclearance application (SCA) establish the allegations. (GE 2, 5, 6) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that in December 2012, Applicant was \ndebarred from a military installation where he both lived and worked. The debarment was \nbased upon an investigation into Applicant\u2019s involvement in activities of GF, who was \nliving with Applicant at the time. These activities included possible involvement in \nprostitution and illegal drug use, possession, and distribution. \nFinancial Considerations: \nApplicant testified that he experienced financial difficulties because debts lingering \nfrom his divorce in 2004 and because of his involvement with GF from about December \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2011 to August 2012. When he was involved with GF, he allowed her access to his bank \naccount and credit cards. He discovered that she abused his trust by charging extensively \non the credit cards and taking significant amounts out of the bank account. He found \nhimself unable to pay his bills and sought relief through filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nplan. He made a few payments under the plan, but when he lost his job as a result of the \ndebarment order in late 2012, he was unable to continue making payments under the \nplan and it was dismissed. He stated that since that time he paid off many of the creditors \nthat were listed in the bankruptcy. His current credit reports reflect that he is paying all his \ndebts in a timely fashion and no collection or charged-off accounts are indicated. The \njudgment listed in the SOR is not reflected in any of the Government\u2019s or the Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports. In 2021, Applicant contacted the judgment creditor, who indicated that \nthere was no active account. (Tr. 41-45, 112-113; GE 5-9; AE A-J) \nPersonal Conduct: \nApplicant met GF in about 2009 at a gentlemen\u2019s club (he referred to it as a \u201cstrip \nclub\u201d) in the city where he was working at the time. He frequented the establishment \nregularly. She was a dancer at the club. GF was then married to a military member. \nApplicant struck up a non-romantic relationship with GF. He even helped GF and her \nhusband buy a car by loaning them money. Sometime in 2011, GF and her husband \nseparated and eventually divorced. Applicant was aware that GF abused alcohol. (Tr. 37-\n38, 63, 67-68, 73)  \nIn December 2011, Applicant accepted a job position located on a military base in \nanother part of the country. In January 2012, Applicant and GF started a romantic \nrelationship. He invited GF to live with him at his new location, which was on base. They \nboth moved to this new location in January 2012. Early on they had a fairly normal \nrelationship. GF was hired at a local hotel to perform housekeeping duties. She did not \nlike that work so she quit. In March she began dancing at a local gentlemen\u2019s club. GF \nasked Applicant for money to buy cocaine and he provided it. He also provided money \nfor her to buy cocaine for the purpose of selling it. Applicant admitted this conduct when \ninterviewed by base law enforcement in August 2012. During his testimony, he admitted \nproviding GF the money, but he denied that he knew it was for the purchase of cocaine. \nHe claimed that he only became aware of the cocaine aspect after he had given her the \nmoney and when she told him she used the money on cocaine. After reviewing the context \nof his August 2012 statement to law enforcement, I do not find his hearing testimony \ncredible. (Tr. 76-78, 81, 97; GE 4 (pp.8-9)) \nWhile living in base housing, Applicant filmed GF dancing a \u201cstrip tease\u201d that they \ncould post on a website. Applicant also agreed to video GF and another man engaging in \nsexual activity, but this did not occur because GF and the other man were too drunk to \nfilm. Applicant believed that GF was engaging in prostitution in the local area where they \nresided and using his credit cards to pay for multiple hotels in the area. In June 2012, \nApplicant and GF traveled to a different state and stayed at a local hotel. GF wanted to \nengage in prostitution and have Applicant film her actions. He agreed to do so. GF had \nsex in the hotel room with a soldier and Applicant filmed it. Applicant stated that he thinks \nthe soldier gave GF money after they were done.

(Tr. \n85, 88, 93, 95; GE 4 (pp. 9, 11-12)) \nApplicant cut GF off financially in late June 2012. He was concerned that GF and \nher friends had brought drugs into his base house so he notified base law enforcement \nand consented to a search of his house. No drugs were found. An investigation ensued \nthat ultimately led to Applicant being debarred from the base in October 2012. Because \nhe could not enter the base, he was unable to perform his job and subsequently submitted \na voluntary letter of resignation in December 2012. Applicant was not prosecuted by state \nor federal officials for any violations of law. (Tr. 98, 108-109; AE L-U) \nApplicant testified that he has improved his life in the last 10 years by cleaning up \nhis financial matters and by pursuing his PhD. The only contact he has had with GF since \nAugust 2012 was when she contacted him through social media in approximately 2019 \nand he told her to leave him alone and then he blocked her on the media platform. (Tr. \n110, 112, 114) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2012 that was dismissed in 2013 for \nfailure to make his plan payments. He also incurred an unpaid judgment in 2008. I find \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially applies: \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial documentation supports that he has paid many of the \nunderlying debts which led to his 2012 bankruptcy filing. Additionally, the judgment no \nlonger appears as a matter of record and is therefore resolved. The above mitigating \ncondition applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community \nstanding; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant was a co-participant or accessory to GF\u2019s illegal and questionable \nactions while they were together as a couple in 2012. These actions included engaging \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin prostitution, recording GF strip tease dancing in Applicant\u2019s base housing, recording \nGF\u2019s sexual activity with a soldier, which Applicant believed was an act of prostitution, \nand allowing GF to use his financial resources to buy drugs and engage in prostitution. \nApplicant\u2019s active role in these criminal activities of GF shows questionable judgment, \nunreliability, untrustworthiness, and a vulnerability to exploitation. All the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and   \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s actions with GF happened approximately 10 years ago and \nthere is no evidence that they have happened since then, it is troubling that a 53-year-old \nman who is well educated and has held a security clearance could be so influenced by a \nyounger woman to allow himself to get involved in her nefarious activities, some of which \ntook place on a military base. His involvement with her over this short period of time also \ncontributed to his financial difficulties. While Applicant has ceased contact with GF, there \nis no evidence that he participated in any counseling to change his behavior. While some \naspects of each mitigating condition apply, on the whole because of Applicant\u2019s overall \nlack of good judgment, his actions are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service and the circumstances surrounding his \ninvolvement with GF and her illegal activities. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns, but that personal conduct concerns were not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a \u2013 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR specifies five allegations: SOR. \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to file federal and state tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019. In Applicant\u2019s initial December 2020 answer, he denied the 2015 to 2019 tax returns were not filed, but admitted that the 2015 to 2018 returns were filed late. In response to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant admitted his federal taxes from 2011 to 2015 were not paid when due. (The allegation reads \u201cthrough 2016.\u201d) When he submitted his December 2000 and March 2021 answers, he was participating in a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In response to SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant admitted that his state income taxes for tax years 2011 to 2015 were not paid when due. (The allegation reads \u201cthrough 2015.)

(March 2021 supplemental answer to \nSOR) \nApplicant married in 2007 and has two sons, 11 and 8 years old. He has lived \nin his current home since 2014. His 84-year-old mother-in-law lives with him. In June \n1998, he received a certificate of completion in computer technology at a computer \nlearning center. He has received several certifications in information technology (IT). \n(GE 1 at 9, 13, 18; Tr. 20, 24-25; March 2021 supplemental answer to SOR at 2) \nApplicant has been employed as an IT exchange systems engineer since \nJanuary 2017. From October 2015 to January 2017, he was a systems engineer. \nBetween May 2012 and October 2015, he was a team leader. In previous jobs, he was \na network engineer or a systems engineer. His other source of income is a rental \nproperty that he purchased in 2006. He has had tenants for the past ten years. Even \nthough he currently receives $1,400 a month in rent, after subtracting the monthly \nmortgage for the rental property, the monthly management fee, and the condominium \nfee, from the rent, he indicated that he loses $400 to $500 a month. (GE 1 at 13-24; GE \n2 at 11-12; Tr. 64-71, 111) \nFrom 2006 to 2012, Applicant worked two jobs during the work day, but \ntaxes were not properly deducted. During the period, he worked full time as: a network \nengineer from April 2005 to April 2006; a systems analyst from April 2006 to April 2007; \nan exchange administrator from July 2006 to February 2008; a systems engineer from \nApril 2007 to November 2008; an exchange administrator from November 2008 to May \n2012; and an exchange team lead from May 2012 to October 2015. (GE 1 at 15-20). \nAccording to his e-QIP, his jobs appeared to overlap one another rather than indicate \nemployment at two jobs simultaneously. Applicant contended that several employers \nregarded him as an independent contractor for their own benefit did not withhold any \ntaxes from his earnings. This employment status caused Applicant and his wife to \nunderpay his taxes. In late 2011, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s job was reduced to part-time work \nbecause of complications with the pregnancy of her first child. In January 2011, his wife \nlost her job while the child remained in the hospital for 12 weeks after birth. She lost her \njob in April 2018 for an unidentified period. (GE 2 at 13-14; Answer to SOR at 3; Tr. 25-\n28) \nIn 2012, Applicant quit his second job, but in February 2013, he resumed the \nsecond employment after his wife\u2019s medical bills related to her pregnancy, and other \nbills, began appearing in the mail. His wife became pregnant in 2013 and gave birth to a \nsecond child in November of that year. Working two jobs caused him to live at an \napartment away from his home during the week. His normal work routine was to leave \nfor work on Monday and not return home until late Friday night for a short weekend with \nhis family. Applicant\u2019s wife resumed working at some time not indicated in the record. \nThen, her job was eliminated again in 2017 or 2018, before she found employment at \nher current job.

In 2015, he had his withholdings set at \nzero with his filing status as \u2018married filing jointly.\u2019 He thought his W-2 withholdings were \nsufficient to cover the federal and state taxes, but they were not. In the period between \n2013 and 2017, his accountant advised him that his excessive earnings were the \nreason his taxes were so high. His federal tax problems were complicated when the IRS \nplaced a tax lien on his rental property. Applicant learned from his attorney in the month \nbefore the hearing that although the withholdings that he and his wife set for their jobs \nappeared to be sufficient, their earnings pushed them into the higher tax bracket where \ntheir withholdings were insufficient to cover the taxes. (GE 2 at 14; Tr. 29-37) \nApplicant testified that in 2017 or 2018, he discovered that his 2016, 2017, and \n2018 federal tax returns were not filed. He claimed that he collected and reviewed a \nlarge quantity of tax-related documents and directed his tax preparer to get the returns \nready for filing. In March 2019, Applicant disclosed his tax problems in his March 2019 \nsecurity clearance application. He filed the 2016 through 2018 federal tax returns and \npresumably the other returns in June 2020. He has made 11 payments under IRS \nrepayment plan, making several payments before the IRS activated the automatic \nwithdrawal in October 2021. At some time, he negotiated a repayment plan with the \nstate tax agency and began paying $480 in monthly installments that have steadily \ndecreased to $288 a month by June 1, 2020. State tax records show that one tax lien \nimposed in January 2017 was released in February 2021. The other state tax lien \nimposed in March 2019 was released in March 2021. (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 9; Tr. 37-44, \n47-49, 49, 51-53; AE D at 1-3) \nThough Applicant was participating in an IRS payment plan beginning in \nNovember 2020, his objective was to take out a loan against his home to extinguish the \ndelinquent IRS income tax balance. Applicant believed that the prime mortgage \ninsurance (PMI) will disappear when he secures the loan against his home. To have the \nloan approved, Applicant indicated he satisfied a medical collection account and had \ntwo credit card accounts removed from his credit report. The financial actions resulted in \na 130-point increase in his credit score to 680. Documentation reflects that Applicant \nhas no IRS liabilities for federal tax years 2011 through 2020. (Tr. 53, 90, 92; AE F at 2, \n5; AE G at 3-17) \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant indicated that he filed W-2 forms for both \n2010 jobs and filed the 2010 federal tax return within the extension period. He knew that \nhe could not pay the $7,000 in tax when he filed the 2010 return and agreed with his \nwife they did not have the funds to pay the tax. He believed he began a repayment plan \nat the time (circa 2011) and was paying $400 to $500 a month until 2018, but had to \nstop when the IRS sought to increase the monthly installment to $1,500. He testified \nthat at some point in 2012, the IRS reviewed the repayment plan and decided they \nwanted the entire amount ($7,000) by the end of 2012. Applicant produced scant \nevidence of actual payments under any previous plan before the IRS plan that began in \nNovember 2020.

Because he was \nunable to pay the taxes due when he filed the return in April 2012, he contemplated \nadding the past-due taxes to the existing payment plan. He recalled he and his wife \ntalked about increasing their income withholdings at a higher amount regardless of the \nexemptions that he claimed, but he did not act on increasing his withholdings. For \nfederal tax year 2012, Applicant was aware when he filed the return that he owed \n$9,800. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 62-63) \nFor federal tax year 2013, Applicant owed $23,000. He recalled resuming his \nsecond employment during that year. He was a W-2 employee at both jobs and he was \naware taxes were being withheld from both jobs. Applicant did not take any action at the \ntime to change his withholding or exemptions to prevent the dramatic increase in tax \nliability, but he did not think his tax liability would be that high. Unable to pay the 2013 \nfederal incomes taxes, Applicant and his wife decided to enroll in a repayment plan \neventually. Despite entries that show installment plans were established for federal tax \nyear 2013, the only plan with documented payments is the plan that began in November \n2020. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 63-67) \nApplicant owed $69,000 in income tax for federal tax year 2014, because he \nobtained an early withdrawal of between $100,000 and $110,000 from his and his wife\u2019s \n401(k) account to pay the down payment on his current home. He was unaware that the \nearly withdrawal from his 401(k) account would be taxed as extra income. He thought \nthat after you pay the taxes and penalties, there was no additional tax consequences. \nWhen he filed his 2014 federal tax return in 2015, he discovered that the 401(k) \nwithdrawal was taxed as extra income. Again, Applicant mentioned an IRS payment \nplan. However, the only active installment plan was the one activated in November \n2020. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 72-74) \nApplicant surmised that the $55,000 in federal taxes he owed for tax year 2015 \nwas due to having two jobs and selling their first home in 2012 by a short-sale, and \nrenting for two years before they purchased their current home. Applicant filed the 2015 \nfederal tax return in January 2017. The reason for the late filing was because of the time \nhe ended his work day at his second job. Though he also claimed that collecting tax \ndocumentation extended the time it took to prepare his 2015 return, he conceded that \nthe documents he was seeking were provided to him electronically or by mail so that he \ncould file his tax return on time. In 2016, Applicant advised his wife to file the 2015 tax \nreturns, but because of her job, raising two children, and tending to their home, she was \nunable to prepare the 2015 return. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 74-80) \nIn 2017, Applicant did not file his 2016 federal tax return on time because his \ntax preparer indicated that to correct everything, the filing would cost Applicant $10,000. \nHe did not have the money so he began discussing his tax issues with a new preparer, \nbut he still did not file his 2016 returns on time because he did not have the $6,205 he \nowed the IRS and cost for tax services of the new preparer, and getting \u201ceverything\u201d \n(presumably documentation) to him in anticipation of enrolling in an IRS payment plan \nrequiring payments of about $3,000 a month.

(GE 3 at 3) The reason for the \ndelay was that he finally completed his review of the voluminous paperwork under the \nrestrictions caused by the pandemic. He did not think that the delinquent federal taxes \nwould be a problem as long as he had a repayment plan in place. He stressed his \nhonest disclosures about the delinquent taxes to the OPM investigator. (If he was \nreferring to the interview with the OPM investigator, the May 2019 PSI and June 2020 \ninterrogatory answers were submitted before he entered the repayment plan in \nNovember 2020.) Apparently, the fact that he was going to receive a refund for federal \ntax years 2017, 2018, and 2019, instilled additional assurance that there would be no \nsecurity clearance issue. He also testified about his desire to negotiate a payment plan \nwith the IRS that called for more manageable payments of $2,400, instead of $3,000 a \nmonth installment package connected to his 2016 federal tax return. (Tr. 85-87) \nApplicant filed his 2016 through 2019 state tax returns on June 30, 2020, \nthe same day he filed his federal returns. He owed $4,257 the state tax agency for tax \nyear 2015 and $7,644 for tax year 2014. He knew he owed the state income taxes when \nhe filed the returns. Applicant claimed that the security clearance investigation was not \none of the reasons he filed the state and federal returns in June 2020. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. \n87-88) \nApplicant\u2019s rental property, which he purchased for $219,00, is currently \nworth about $180,000. He is trying to sell the rental before the 15-year adjustable-rate-\nmortgage (ARM) becomes due in March 2022. (Tr. 88-89) \nConcerning earnings for Applicant and his wife, he takes home about $8,000 a \nmonth. His wife earns a little over $5,000 a month. He and his wife still have $105,000 \nin the 401(k) account he took an early withdrawal from in 2014. (Tr. 101-102) \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s expenses, his mortgage is $4,500 a month, which \nincludes property taxes, insurance, and escrow. The first mortgage on the rental \nproperty is $1,030 a month and the second is $265 a month. He and his wife make \nmonthly payments on four credit cards. Applicant\u2019s credit card balance is $18,000, and \nhe pays $400 on the card every month. His wife\u2019s total balance on three credit cards is \nabout $17,500. Since he pays for all the credit cards, his monthly payments amount to \n$900. He pays $166 a month in car insurance for two cars. He has been paying $700 a \nmonth on a time share since 2015. He purchased the timeshare in 2003 when the \nmonthly fee was lower. Applicant has not used the timeshare in the last few years and \nhas not taken any other vacations in the last two. (Tr. 95-104) \nTo prevent similar financial problems from recurring in the future, \nApplicant intends to remain employed with his current employer who offers no benefits \nlike paid time off (PTO). He plans to forego future vacations as he has \nin the last \nfew years. He receives a free meal for delivering meals to the elderly.

(Tr. 108-\n113)  \nCharacter Evidence  \nOn October 20, 2021, reference JR indicated that she known Applicant for 27 \nyears and taught him history in high school. In subsequent years, she observed him \nbecome as good husband, father, and citizen. His entire family is active in church. JR \nbelieves Applicant is security conscious. (AE E1) AE E2 contains a blank page followed \na copy of JR\u2019s AE E1 reference. \nIn a statement dated October 21, 2021, RN expressed that Applicant attended \nher high school. In recent years they have resumed their friendship. RN knows that he \nis supportive of his children\u2019s sport and church activities. He has demonstrated his \ntrustworthiness by caretaking her home when she is away. Applicant does not display a \nflashing lifestyle despite his good income. (AE 3) \nReference RW has known Applicant for 30 years, partially because he and \nRW\u2019s son attended the same high school. RW believes Applicant has always \ndisplayed goal-oriented behavior that has worked hand-in-hand with his \ndependability. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAn applicant who seeks a security clearance with the Government must \ndemonstrate that he has good judgment and is trustworthy. A gauge of his judgment \nand trustworthiness can be determined by an evaluation of how he manages his \npersonal affairs. An applicant who has a history of financial irresponsibility in not filing or \npaying his federal and state taxes in a timely manner may also demonstrate \nirresponsibility in failing to comply with rules and regulations for safeguarding sensitive \nor classified information. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise a security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as \nrequired. \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant still owes four of the five credit \ncard accounts. He still owes an undetermined amount of money for the house that was \nforeclosed and sold in 2014. The lack of a plan to address the delinquencies continues \nto raise doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n11 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 34 years old and married with three children. He exhibited good \njudgment in 2012 by enrolling in a debt consolidation service to pay off the credit card \ncreditors in one monthly payment. Assuming he made payments under the plan, he \ndisplayed poor judgment two years later by abandoning the debt consolidation in favor \nof filing bankruptcy. He showed more poor judgment by dropping the bankruptcy idea in \nfavor of using his funds to rent a home. Except for SOR 1.f, Applicant has not contacted \nthe mortgage company and the credit card creditors in at least four years. He has never \nhad financial counseling and has no plan to extricate himself from his financial woe. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment from July 2017 to January 2018, and several months of unemployment \nbefore he started his current job, no doubt affected his income stream. However, \navailable records indicate that Applicant has been employed for the most part since \nJanuary 2018, almost four years before his hearing. The length of time that has elapsed \nsince his loss of income does not justify his recent inability to repay his creditors or to \nremain in contact with them. He does not receive significant credit under these \nmitigating conditions because of his overall failure to act responsibly under the \ncircumstances, especially with regard to his taxes, and the length of time that has \nelapsed since incurring these debts. Despite receiving financial counseling, there are no \nclear indications that the problem is resolved or under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) is not \napplicable. \nOf significant concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely pay his Federal \nincomes taxes from 2015 to 2018. He was alerted to the fact that his failure to pay his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntaxes and his other indebtedness were of concern to the Government during his May \n16, 2019 OPM PSI, and later when he received his September 11, 2020 SOR. Although \nhe claims to have made payments to several of his creditors, the available credit reports \ndo not corroborate his claims of payment nor has he produced any documentation that \nwould verify such payments. He also claimed without corroboration, that he sought \nfinancial counseling through his bank and that his counselor was assisting him to \nrefinance his house. In addition to his long-standing Federal tax arrearages, two student \nloans and two accounts remain unresolved. With so much outstanding debt, and absent \nadditional post-hearing evidence, lingering doubts about Applicant\u2019s security eligibility \nremain. \nWhile the following case is primarily directed to the timely filing of tax returns, the \nimportance the Appeal Board places on fulfilling one\u2019s legal obligations is instructive. \nSuch repeated failures to fulfill those obligations do not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nThis is particularly pertinent as it pertains to tax matters. The DOHA Appeal Board has \ncommented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). (emphasis in original) \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); \nISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015).   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is a 56-year-old senior management specialist integrated \nmaster schedule, employed by a defense contractor since June 2021. He served \nhonorably in the U.S Navy for 20 years and later worked as a civilian employee in \nsupport of the defense industry. He has significant security clearance experience and is \nfamiliar with the requirements of maintaining a clearance. Having a Secret security \nclearance is a requirement of his continued employment. Applicant is married and \nsupports a 16-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. He has held a leadership \nposition with his local American Legion Post for three years and contributes to his \ncommunity. \nHowever, for at least six years, he has failed to grasp the importance of one of \nthe fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is timely paying his Federal income \ntaxes when due. This is especially crucial for an individual seeking to retain a security \nclearance and working for a defense contractor advancing the national security of the \nUnited States. The importance of maintaining financial responsibility should have been \nwell known to Applicant, having held a clearance for many years in the past. \nFrom the evidence presented, Applicant\u2019s history of accruing delinquent tax debt \nfor years is particularly concerning. Neglecting his obligations to repay his student loans \nand accruing significant additional consumer debt is equally concerning. That said, \nApplicant recognizes that he needs to take corrective action. Applicant is a bright and \ntalented individual, who is more than capable of addressing his income tax and \nindebtedness problems in a responsible way. This decision should not be construed as \na determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards establishing a track \nrecord of financial responsibility, and a better track record of behavior consistent with \nhis obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security \nclearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on December 17,2018. On \nApril 30, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 22, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

Government Exhibits (GX) 1, 3, 4, and 5 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. GX 4, an unauthenticated summary of \nseveral interviews of Applicant by a security investigator, was not admitted. (Tr. 14.) \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. I kept the record open until June \n30, 2022, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted \nAX B, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June \n8, 2022. The record closed on June 30, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j, with explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, \nand 1.h. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since \nDecember 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1998 to July \n2007 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant. He worked for federal \ncontractors from July 2007 to August 2013. He was unemployed from August 2013 to \nJanuary 2014. He worked in private sector jobs from January to July 2014. He has worked \nfor defense contractors from July 2014 to the present. \nApplicant received a security clearance in October 2012. His security clearance is \ncurrently suspended, and he is on leave without pay. (AX A.) \nApplicant married in September 2002, and his wife committed suicide in \nSeptember 2004. He remarried in July 2007 and divorced in April 2017. He has two \nchildren, ages 23 and 12. He received an associate\u2019s degree in November 2006. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $35,000 and a home \nforeclosure. The debts are reflected in credit reports from December 2021, November \n2019, and February 2019. (GX 3, 4, and 5.) The evidence concerning these debts is \nsummarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: deficiency after a vehicle repossession charged off for $18,630. \nApplicant has not contacted this creditor or taken any action to resolve the debt. (Tr. 46-\n47.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent rent payments for an apartment, referred for collection \nof $4,456. Applicant testified that he has disputed the amount of this debt with the creditor, \nand the dispute has not been resolved. (Tr. 48.) He submitted no documentary evidence \nof the basis for the dispute. The debt is not resolved. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: debt to U.S. Government agency placed for collection of $3,379. \nThis debt arose when Applicant enrolled in a class using his veteran\u2019s benefits, but failed \nto complete the class. He testified that the debt was partially resolved by diverting his \nfederal income tax refunds and is now being collected by deductions from his disability \npay. He believes that the debt has been reduced to about $1,100. (Tr. 50-53.) He did not \nprovide any documentation showing diversion of his federal entitlements to resolve this \ndebt or any other efforts to resolve the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $987. Applicant testified that he \nhad not made any payments on this debt but that it was \u201ccleared,\u201d because it is no longer \nreflected on his credit reports. (Tr. 53-54.) It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: charge account charged off for $831. Applicant testified that this \ndebt was for a purchase of tires, and he has been making $20 payments since January \n2022. He did not provide any documentation of payments. (Tr. 54-55.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: debt referred for collection of $1,221. Applicant testified that he \ndisputed this debt with the credit bureau when it first appeared on his credit report in 2019, \nand that the dispute is reflected on his credit report. (Tr. 55-56.) The February 2019 credit \nreport reflects the debt and the dispute. (GX 5 at 12.) The credit reports from November \n2019 and December 2021 do not reflect the debt. (GX 3; GX 4.) Because the debt is too \nrecent to have \u201caged off\u201d the credit report, it is likely that the dispute was resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: utility debt referred for collection of $169. Applicant testified that he \npaid this debt and that he currently has service with the same provider. (Tr. 57-58.) He \ndid not provide any documentation of payment or evidence that the account is current. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: telecommunications debt referred for collection of $219. Applicant \ndenied this debt on the ground that he has never had an account with this provider. He \ntestified that he disputed the debt with the credit bureau. (Tr. 58.) The February 2019 \ncredit report reflects that the dispute was resolved. (GX 5 at 12.) The debt is not reflected \non the two more recent credit reports. (GX 3; GX 4.) It is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: debt charged off for $5,106. Applicant testified that this debt was for \na personal loan, and that it was satisfied when he obtained another loan from the same \nlender. (Tr. 56-61.) The February 2019 credit report reflects that this account was closed \nwhen the loan was refinanced, and that the account is current. (GX 5 at 9.) This debt is \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: home foreclosure. Applicant testified that he fell behind on his \npayments while he was unemployed, and he contacted the lender and asked to modify \nthe loan because of hardship or to allow a short sale of the property. (AX B.) Both \napplications were denied, and the lender advised him and his family to move out of the \nhouse. They moved out in August 2013 and rented an apartment nearby.

He contacted the lender and \nasked for 60 days to modify the loan, because he was required to give his landlord 60 \ndays of notice to move out. The bank refused to delay the process, and the house was \nsold. (Tr. 62-64.) The February 2019 credit report reflects that the loan was foreclosed, \nthe collateral was sold, and that there is no balance due. (GX 5 at 5.) The debt is resolved. \nIn 2019, Applicant contacted his credit union for advice on how to improve his \ncredit rating and better manage his finances. He was able to purchase a home in April \n2021. He missed one payment at the beginning of his mortgage, but his payments now \nare current. (Tr. 67-70.) \nBefore Applicant was suspended without pay, his take-home pay was about \n$4,400 per month. He is now receiving $378 per month in unemployment compensation. \nHis payments on his home mortgage loan are $1,415 per month. He purchased a used \nvehicle in 2019, and his car payments are $641 per month. He pays child support of \n$1,400 per month. (Tr. 70-72.) He has about $15,000 in his retirement account. (Tr. 79.) \nHe has no savings. (Tr. 83.) He receives military disability pay. (Tr. 54.) However, he did \nnot submit any evidence of disability pay at the hearing and did not report it in his \napplication for modification of his previous home mortgage. \nA former roommate who lived with Applicant a total of five or six years and who \nserved with Applicant on active duty testified that he considers Applicant an \u201chonest, \ngood, and responsible person\u201d who paid his fair share of their living expenses. The \nroommate is employed by a federal contractor and has held a security clearance since \n1996. (Tr. 103.) The roommate was not aware of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. (Tr. 98.) \nA friend and former supervisor from 2017 to 2019 testified that Applicant was a \ndedicated, reliable, and trustworthy worker. (Tr. 108.) He also was unaware of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts. (Tr.108-110.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

He acted responsibly regarding the \nforeclosure alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j by applying for a loan modification and requesting 60 \ndays to complete the loan modification in order to avoid a penalty for premature \ntermination of a rental contract. When the lender refused to grant him time to complete \nthe loan modification, the debt was satisfied by the foreclosure sale. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant obtained financial counseling and was \nable to improve his credit worthiness to the extent that he was able to obtain a home \nmortgage loan and purchase another home. However, his current financial situation is not \nyet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but not for the other \ndebts. Although the debt resulting from the home foreclosure alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j is \nresolved, it was resolved involuntarily. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h, which \nApplicant successfully disputed. It is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \nbecause Applicant did not submit evidence of the basis for the dispute, and the dispute \nis not resolved. He did not dispute any of the other debts alleged. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service and many years of service while employed by defense contractors. He \nwas sincere and candid at the hearing. He sought and received financial counseling. \nHowever, he is not likely to achieve financial stability in the foreseeable future.

An applicant who claims that debts have been resolved is \nexpected to support his claims with documentary evidence. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016).

The SOR \nand the answer (Item 1) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old and is a high school graduate. He married in 2007 and \nwas divorced in 2016. Applicant had two children (a son nine and a daughter twelve) from \nthat marriage. He remarried in 2017. The two children live with Applicant and his current \nwife. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2005 until 2016, when \nhe was separated with an other than honorable discharge. (Item 2.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has nine delinquent debts totaling $36,882. \nApplicant admitted those delinquencies. He claimed that he was paying on two of those \naccounts and was settling a third account. Applicant claimed that his sudden discharge \nfrom the Marine Corps contributed to his financial difficulties. (Item 3.) Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquencies range from 2016 to 2021. (Items 4 through 7.) He provided no documents \nin support of his Answer. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) The SOR debts are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies occurred recently and persist to this day. I cannot find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. Applicant no doubt suffered some financial difficulty upon his \nunexpected discharge from the Marine Corps, including unemployment. He did not, \nhowever, provide any documents supporting what those difficulties were or how he \naddressed them responsibly. I cannot find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant claimed that \nhe was paying on two accounts and was settling a third account. As with AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant failed to produce any documents supporting that claim. The Board has \npreviously stated that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present \ndocumentation showing that debts have been resolved or are being resolved. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have also considered the whole-person concept. \nApplicant leaves me with questions as to his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n4 \n\n \n \n     \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-i.:  \n     Against Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly not consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant responded to the SOR on October 21, 2021 and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 29, 2022, and interposed no objections to the materials in the FORM. Afforded an opportunity to supplement the FORM, Applicant did not provide any additional information. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2022 Summary of Pleadings Under Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for at least tax year 2013, as required; (b) accrued delinquent federal income taxes for tax year 2018 in the amount of $1,587; (c) accumulated delinquent consumer debts exceeding $39,000; and (d) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in about May 2013, which was dismissed in about July 2013. Allegedly, the debts alleged to be delinquent have not been resolved and remain outstanding. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all but two of the allegations and added attachments to his response. He admitted the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b (delinquent taxes owed the federal Government) and SOR \u00b6 1.g (filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief).

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial considerations concerns.

He admitted the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b \n(delinquent taxes owed the federal Government) and SOR \u00b6 1.g (filing for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy relief).

(Item 4) To date, Applicant has provided no evidence \nof his addressing his delinquent federal taxes owed for tax year 2018. \nIn May 2013, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. (Items 3-7). He \nreportedly scheduled $19,000 in debts. (Item 4) Of these scheduled debts, his primary \ndebt of concern was a mortgage debt on his home. (Item 4) Once he was able to \narrange new payment terms with his lender, he simply stopped paying the trustee on his \nagreed plan payments. Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 petition was thereafter dismissed in July \n2013 for lapses in approved plan payments. (Item 4) Some of the accounts that are \ncovered by the SOR were included in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \nApplicant\u2019s assigned reason for accumulating his delinquent debts was his prioritizing \nhis needs to provide financial assistance to his family members over his taking \nresponsibility for paying his debts in a timely manner and keeping his finances in sound \nworking order.  (Item 4) \nSince January 2012, Applicant has been employed consistently by his current \nemployer without any reported interruptions in his work schedules. To date, he has not \nmade any documented progress in addressing his delinquent federal tax and consumer \ndebts. Afforded an opportunity to supplement the FORM with updated information about \naddressing his debts, he failed to do so. \nBecause there is a lack of documented information from Applicant in the record \nto assess his reported delinquent tax and consumer accounts, no favorable inferences \ncan be drawn as to whether he will be able to resolve his SOR-listed debt delinquencies \nin the foreseeable future. Based on his untimely filing of his 2013 federal and state tax \nreturns and the absence of sufficient evidence of addressing his SOR-listed delinquent \naccounts, Applicant\u2019s prospects for resolving his debt delinquencies are uncertain at \nbest. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. The AG guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.

AG \u00b6 18. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of tax-filing failures and debt delinquencies \n(inclusive of both tax and other debts) are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following rules, regulations, and \nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified ad sensitive information or \nto holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, \n2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s history of \nfinancial difficulties associated with his timely tax-filing lapses for tax year 2013 and his \ndelinquent debt accruals (both tax and consumer debts) raise considerable concerns \nover his ability to manage his finances in a responsible and reliable way. \nBased on the information Applicant furnished, extenuating circumstances played \nno material role in Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent accounts. Gainfully employed \nfor many years (at least since 2012), he provided little documentation as to how he \nbudgeted and addressed his tax-filing and debt management responsibilities before \nreceiving the SOR in October 2021. Why he waited so long to address his 2013 federal \nand state income tax returns and delinquent tax and consumer and accounts in a \nmaterial way with the resources available to him prior to receiving the SOR is unclear. \nWith so little financial information to work with relative to the circumstances prompting \nhim to fall behind with his timely tax-filing obligations in 2013, and addressing his tax \nand other delinquent accounts, no meaningful extenuation or mitigation credit can be \nassigned to him at this time. \nTo date, Applicant has not resolved his outstanding tax and other delinquent \naccounts. Promises (express or implied) by an applicant to pay or otherwise resolve \ndelinquent debts in the future without well-developed repayment plans do not meet \nAppeal Board requirements for establishing a track record for paying debts in a timely \nmanner and otherwise acting in a responsible way.

More time and \npayment initiatives are required to enable Applicant to meet his evidentiary and \npersuasive burdens of proof. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax year 2013 and adequately address his delinquent tax and other debts are \notherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a security clearance. While \nApplicant is entitled to credit for his contributions to the defense industry, his \nemployment contributions are not enough at this time to overcome his tax-filing lapses \nand his lack of a meaningful track record for dealing with them, paying his delinquent \ndebts, and maintaining responsible control of his finances. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 9, 2019. On \nJune 4, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, denied all the allegations, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready \nto proceed on February 21, 2020. Scheduling of the hearing was delayed by health \n\n \n2 \n \nprecautions imposed by DOD in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The case was \nassigned to me on September 24, 2021. On October 5, 2021, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nOctober 20, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through Q, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 26, 2021. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old radiological control technician employed by a defense \ncontractor since May 2019. She served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October \n1981 to July 1982 and in the U.S. Army Reserve until July 1987. She received an \nhonorable discharge. She worked for various non-federal employers from at least \nNovember 2012 until she was laid off in June 2018. She was unemployed until she was \nhired by her current employer. She has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant married in May 1985, divorced in November 1990, married in June 1992, \nOctober 1995, divorced in November 1990, married in June 1992, and divorced in April \n1995. She married her current spouse in October 1995. She received an associate\u2019s \ndegree in July 2006. She has two adult children.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g) that are reflected \nin credit reports from February 2020 and November 2019. (GX 3 and 4.) The medical bills \nwere incurred after she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2008, and the costs of \nmedical treatment were not fully covered by her medical insurance. (GX 5 at 6.) The \nmedical accounts alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g were referred to the same collection agency.  \n \nAppellant contacted the collection agency in 2019, before she received the SOR, \nand began making payments. She initially paid the collection agency $25 per month but \nthen increased the amount as other bills were paid off. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-\n1.g have been paid in full. (AX E, F, and G.)  \n \nAppellant initially thought that the $603 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a had been \nreferred to the same collection agency. When she discovered that it was not included, \nshe began making payments directly to the original creditor. On October 14, 2021, she \npaid $300 on the debt alleged in SOR 1.a, and she agreed to pay the balance in six $64 \ninstallments. (AX D; AX P; Tr. 36-40.) \n \n \nApplicant received Social Security disability pay of $1,500 per month when she \nwas unable to work due to her brain tumor. During a personal subject interview with a \nsecurity investigator in December 2019, she told the investigator that she returned to work \npart time in 2014 and reported her employment to the Social Security Administration \nOffice (SSAO), but the disability payments were not terminated, resulting in the $38,988 \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. She believed that she was entitled to disability pay for nine \nmonths after returning to work full time, but she continued to receive it for an additional \n\n \n3 \n \nyear. After she was notified in September 2016 that she had been overpaid, she made \narrangements to repay it. She testified that she was unaware that she was being overpaid \nuntil she received a letter from the SSAO notifying her of the overpayment. (GX 5 at 6; \nTr. 46-49.) She began repaying the overpayment at $250 per month until she was laid off \nin June 2018. Now that she is employed, she has resumed payments at the rate of $100 \nper month. (AX C, H through O, and Q.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n4 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe evidence submitted at the hearing establishes the two disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c): (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). AG \u00b6 19(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices) is not relevant because \nthe SOR does not allege that Applicant fraudulently obtained the overpayment of disability \npayments. Applicant credibly testified that she was not aware of the overpayment of \ndisability benefits until she received the letter from the SSAO. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability, I have considered her negligent failure to notify the SSAO when \nthe payments did not stop after she returned to work.   \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for Applicant\u2019s medical debts. It is not established for the \noverpayment of disability benefits, because it could have been prevented if Applicant had \nnotified the appropriate authorities when the payments were not terminated. The \ncontinued monthly payment of $1,500 in disability benefits after she returned to full-time \nwork should have caught her attention and triggered corrective action. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant has paid all her medical debts except the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, on which she is making payments. She has established and \nadhered to a payment plan for the overpayment of disability benefits. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n6 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. Although she was careless in failing to terminate her disability \nbenefits, she has acted responsibly in resolving her delinquent debts. She appears to \nhave learned an expensive lesson about monitoring the receipt of government benefits. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He has a high \nschool diploma and a few college credits. \nHe holds the position of Help Desk \nAdministrator. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant joined the U.S Army for an eight \nyear commitment, from July 2009 to February 2015, six years of active duty service, \nand then from February 2015 to May 2017, two years of reserve duty. On active duty, \nApplicant underwent a number of urinalysis, and understood military rules and \nregulations that strictly prohibit the use of illegal drugs. \nApplicant held a security \nclearance throughout his military career. \nAt the end of his six-year active duty service, Applicant was required to finalize \nhis paperwork and met with a recruiter to get his orders to go into the reserves. \nApplicant does not know if he signed the wrong paperwork, or if the recruiter explained \nsomething incorrectly to him, but apparently, Applicant signed a new reserve contract \nfor eight years without realizing it. \nApplicant testified that during the entire two years he spent in the reserves he \nrepeatedly asked his command if he could be released after completing his two years, \nand was denied. Applicant did not like the reserves, as it was not a good fit for him. He \nwas told by his Commander and Sergeant that since he signed the contract he was \nobligated to complete it regardless of his personal circumstances. \nAt this point, Applicant decided that the most expedient way to break his contract \nand be released from the Army was to use marijuana. Applicant purchased marijuana \nand used it on three separate occasions between March 2017 and May 2017, before a \ndrill weekend knowing that he was subject to a urinalysis that it would come back \npositive. After the first positive urinalysis, Applicant was counseled and received an \nArticle 15. After failing two more drug tests, Applicant was administratively separated \nfrom the U.S. Army in May 2017. \nApplicant received a general discharge under \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhonorable conditions for testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as \nmarijuana. \nApplicant knew that he would be released from the military and his security \nclearance would be revoked for using marijuana. However, he did not consider future \nconsequences. Applicant stated that he has not used marijuana since May 2017, and \nhe has no intentions of ever using it again. Applicant states that he did not enjoy the \nuse of marijuana and had never used it before this situation. He understands that \nalthough marijuana is legal in some states, it is prohibited and illegal while employed for \nthe DoD and while possessing a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified that Applicant is a good performer on the \njob and has learned quickly. She states that for the most part Applicant has been \nreliable. Applicant has had a problem being on time to work. Applicant told her that he \nis not a morning person. Before getting Human Resources involved, she discussed the \nproblem with him. After Human Resources was made aware of the problem, and \nApplicant received a written warning, the problem has improved.  (Tr. pp. 49-50.) \nApplicant\u2019s father, who is retired Air Force, after 26 years, testified that his son \nhas changed since his time in the reserves. Since April 2018, Applicant has been living \nwith his parents, and working on improving himself. He got a job and has passed their \ndrug tests. He is taking care of his health and doing everything that he was told to do \nby his family and his employer. His father considers him to be an outstanding person \nnow.  (Tr. p. 16.) \nApplicant states that he now knows that he made a bad decision to use \nmarijuana. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n         \n \n \n      \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. \nApplicant deliberately used \nmarijuana, while serving in the military and possessing a security clearance, for the \npurpose of testing positive on his urinalysis in order to be discharged from the military. \nApplicant states that he is no longer using marijuana. His actions are not mitigated. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a while-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One of the conditions is potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e)the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant used marijuana while possessing a security clearance, and while \nserving in the U.S. Army reserves. Applicant knew that the use of marijuana is against \nFederal law, and military policies. Applicant also knew that the use of marijuana is \nillegal while possessing a security clearance. \nHis conduct shows immaturity, poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant did not follow the rules. Instead, \nhe chose to live his life to his convenience, and disregarded the law. While in the \nreserves, to break his contract, Applicant deliberately used marijuana in order to test \npositive on his urinalysis to be released from his obligation. This was also immature, \nirresponsible, inappropriate behavior, that shows questionable judgment. Under the \nparticular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the maturity level, integrity, and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability necessary to access classified information. At this time, Applicant does not \nmeet the eligibility qualifications for a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified information. \nApplicant understands the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand knows that marijuana use is not tolerated. Applicant is not an individual in whom \nthe Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The record was kept open until October 1, 2021, to allow him to submit \nadditional evidence. He submitted AE B-G, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 1, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.a, which he admitted. After a \nreview of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nfor his current employer as a permanent employee in 2015. He is a network engineer. \nHe served in the U.S. Marine Corps, beginning in 1990, before being honorably \ndischarged for medical reasons after over two years of service. He has a twenty percent \nDepartment of Veterans\u2019 (VA) Affairs disability rating. He is twice divorced (most \nrecently in 2018) and has two adult daughters. (Tr. at 6, 37, 41; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that in 2019, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action that \nwas discharged the same year; that Applicant failed to timely file his 2009-2015 federal \ntax returns; that he failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax years 2009-2015; and \nthat he owes $5,733 toward his delinquent federal tax debt and $3,479 toward his \ndelinquent state tax debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in approximately 2011, when he left a \ncontractor job in another state because he could not afford to live there and make his \nchild support payments to his children who lived in another state. From 2011 to January \n2015, he experienced either short-term employment or periods of unemployment. In \n2008, he divorced his first wife. Under the terms of their property settlement, his ex-wife \nwas to refinance several debts, including the mortgage on the martial home, within one \nyear so the debts would no longer be attributed to Applicant. Despite Applicant\u2019s filing a \nMotion to Enforce, for which he received a judgment, his ex-wife still did not refinance \nthe debts. Applicant filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy primarily to rid himself of those \nmartial financial obligations. A recent credit report indicates that he is current on all his \nconsumer debt. (Tr. at 38, 52; SOR Answer (\u00b6 1.A); GE 5) \nApplicant admitted in both of his security clearance applications (SCA) and \nduring his background investigation interview with a defense investigator that he failed \nto timely file his 2009-2015 federal and state income tax returns. He claimed several \nreasons for his dilatory action including that his second wife always handled their \nfinances, including taking care of their taxes, and when they divorced in 2008, he was \nunprepared to take over that responsibility. Also, he mistakenly believed that if he was \npaying his taxes through payroll withholding and he was paying more than he ended up \nowing, he did not have to file a tax return. He also did not know that any tax refund he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmight be owed was forfeited if he failed to file his returns and failed to claim the refund \nwithin three years of when it arose. In what was essentially a state of mental paralysis, \nhe procrastinated taking any action. He finally contacted a tax preparation service which \nprepared and allegedly filed his bulk federal and state tax returns for years 2009-2015 in \neither 2016 or 2017 (he testified that the filing was in 2016, but his statement to the \ndefense investigator claims it was in 2017). He testified that the primary reason for \nfinally acting on his tax situation was because he realized the impact it had on his \nsecurity clearance after he completed his SCA. Despite being given the opportunity until \nOctober 2021 to submit post-hearing evidence, Applicant failed to produce \ndocumentation showing that the tax returns for tax years 2009-2014 were filed with the \nfederal and state tax authorities (the record shows that he filed his 2015 federal return \nlate in 2017). Applicant produced documentary evidence showing that he has timely \nfiled his federal tax returns for tax years 2016-2020. (Tr. at 42-45, 50, 55, 57, 65, 74; GE \n3; AE B-E) \nApplicant documented that he has paid all his delinquent tax debt to both the \nstate and federal tax authorities. He showed the payments that he made in June 2020. \nHe also presented documentation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that \nas of August 2021 he owed $0. The documentation from the state showed that he had a \ncredit of $150 as of August 2021. (Tr. at 46, 49, 65; SOR Answer (attachments)) \n \nApplicant presented testimony from three of his supervisors (1st, 2nd, and 3rd  \nlevel). All of them were aware of the SOR allegations. All three hold security clearances \nand are aware of the requirements and responsibilities for those holding or seeking \nclearances. Applicant was universally described by these supervisors as hardworking, \ndependable, honest, loyal, and trustworthy. None of the supervisors had any \nreservations about Applicant holding a security clearance. (Tr. at 20-25, 27-28, 31-34) \n \nApplicant also presented multiple written character recommendations. All \nexpress their belief in Applicant\u2019s integrity, responsibility, and reliability. They believe \nthat he is an asset to their company. Several specifically recommend that he receive a \nsecurity clearance. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant filed a 2019 Chapter 7 bankruptcy that discharged all of his included \ndebts in 2019. He also failed to timely file his 2009-2015 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He owed both the IRS and the state tax authority for delinquent income taxes, \nwhich he eventually paid in 2020. The record evidence supports all the SOR allegations. \nI find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy was necessitated because his ex-wife refused to honor \nher divorce commitment of assuming the marital debts as she agreed to do by \nrefinancing the debt and releasing Applicant from it. Applicant acted responsibly by \navailing himself of the legal process of bankruptcy to rid himself of the marital debt. His \nrecent credit report shows his responsible credit use. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant documented that he has paid his delinquent income tax debt to both \nthe IRS and the state taxing authority. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e. Timely \nfiling his yearly tax returns was not beyond Applicant\u2019s control and also shows \nirresponsibility on his part. There is no documentary evidence to show that he has ever \nfiled his 2009-2014 federal or state tax returns. While he documented his timely filing of \nhis 2016-2020, his earlier returns remain unaddressed, except for his 2015 federal \nreturn, which was filed late. His non-filing and delay in filing shows a lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(g) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.c. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, the noncooperation of his ex-wife, his \noutstanding references from his three work supervisors, and his character letters of \nsupport. However, his handling of his tax issues, particularly his protracted delay in filing \nseven years\u2019 worth of tax returns (which has not actually been documented), causes me \nto question his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a, 1.d, 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nIn an undated answer to the SOR, Applicant requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree and is attending \ncollege. He needs to complete five classes to be awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nmarried in 2013 and has two grown stepchildren. He enlisted in the Army Reserve in July \n2014 and is a sergeant (E-5). He has been employed by a federal contractor since 2017. \nHe has no periods of unemployment and has worked since he was 16 years old. (Tr. 19-\n23; GE 1) \nAfter graduating from high school in 1998, Applicant attended college, but quit for \nperiods of time to take care of his grandmother and later his mother. His grandmother \npassed away in 2015 and his mother in 2019. He funded his college education with \nstudent loans. (Tr. 20-23) \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is about $55,000. He estimated from his Army Reserve \ntraining he earns about $3,000 annually. His wife is employed with a state agency and \nearns about $31,000. (Tr. 23-25) \nApplicant explained that in approximately 2016 his wife had medical issues that \nrequired surgery and she was out of work. She received disability payments, but it was \ninsufficient for them to continue to pay all of their expenses, and they fell behind. Applicant \nstarted a new job in 2017, and he was able to address bills that had fallen behind. His \nwife also resumed work. They made double payments to catch-up on bills. He testified \nthat the creditors agreed to accept his payments to resolve his debts. (Tr. 26-27) \nCredit reports from April 2019 and January 2020 and admissions during \nApplicant\u2019s background interview with a government investigator corroborate the SOR \nallegations. (GE 2, 3, 4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a charged-off car loan ($18,444). Applicant \ntestified after he got behind paying this loan, he contacted the creditor and it agreed to \naccept payments. He said he was making three payments a month, and he was able to \nplace the debt in good standing, but it still showed as charged off on his credit report. \nApplicant provided documents to show the debt has been paid in full. The debt is resolved. \n(Tr. 26-29; AE F, O) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($327) is from Applicant\u2019s credit union account. He \nbelieved that there was some type of glitch and a bill did not get paid through his account \nand perhaps this was an overdraft. When he learned of the problem, he resolved it with \nthe credit union. He provided documents to show that his accounts with this credit union \nare in good standing. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 30-32; AE P, Q, R) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d ($30,071 and $21,217) are delinquent student \nloans. Applicant testified that he was paying one student loan and did not realize that \nthere were actually two of them. He contacted the creditor to have them consolidated. \nApplicant provided documents to show he had been making payments on a student loan \nsince 2016. He also provided a document from the Department of Education from \nDecember 2020 confirming a repayment plan agreement. He is required to pay $179 \nmonthly. He provided documents showing payments. His student loans are now deferred \nbecause of the pandemic. He testified that he is making sure his finances are in order for \nwhen payments resume. He hoped to restart paying the loans before the deferment \nexpired. (Tr. 31-37, 42-45; AE B, M, N, T) \nApplicant is participating in a program through the military that assists him in \nrepaying his student loans. The total amount he is eligible to receive is $30,000. By \ncontracting to serve three more years in the Army Reserve, he became eligible to receive \n$20,000. He reenlisted to serve six years. The $20,000 payment is applied directly to his \nstudent loan balance. Applicant completed his first enlistment and the loan repayment will \nbe paid during his current enlistment. He testified that he has applied for it and is waiting \nfor it to be disbursed. He is also eligible to receive another $10,000 in the future after he \ncompletes the term of his enlistment. He provided the corroborating documents. (Tr. 37-\n42, 47-49; AE A, C) \nIn 2019, Applicant applied for a public service loan forgiveness employment \nprogram. It requires that he make consistent student loan payments for ten years at which \ntime the balance of his student loans will be forgiven. He qualifies through his military \nservice. The payments are stayed during the pandemic deferment period. Applicant must \nhave his public service employment recertified by his employer each year. Applicant \nprovided corroborating documents. (Tr. 40, 45-50; AE D, E, H, J) \nApplicant has had a part-time job since 2019 to increase his income and pay\nunexpected expenses. He works about 20-25 hours a week. He and his wife purchased \na house in February 2021. He credibly testified that he can afford all of his expenses. He \ncontributes to a 401(k) pension plan and has some money in savings. He and his wife \nmaintain a written budget. Most of their bills are paid automatically each month. (Tr. 50-\n55) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had two delinquent debts and student loans that were unresolved. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a period in 2016 when his wife had \nmedical issues and needed surgery. She was on disability and the decrease in their \nhousehold income impacted their ability to pay some of their bills. These issues were \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. Applicant started a new job in 2017 and with his wife resuming \nwork, they caught up on their bills. Applicant provided documents to show the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are resolved. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s student loans, he provided documents to show he was \nmaking payments since 2016, but was confused and unaware that he had two loans. He \nconsolidated them and is in a repayment plan. He is also eligible and is participating in a \nloan repayment program through the military. He already has qualified for a disbursement \nof $20,000 that will be applied to his student loan debt. He will be eligible, in the future \nafter completion of additional service, for an additional $10,000 to be applied to his \nstudent loan debt. Applicant has also applied for a public service loan forgiveness \nemployment program. He must make consistent payments on his student loans for ten \nyears, at which time, the balance will be forgiven. Applicant works a part-time job to cover \nunexpected expenses. He and his wife keep a written budget and pay their bills on time. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to conclude there are clear indications that \nhis financial issues are under control. He has a repayment plan for his student loan debt. \nHe has qualified to receive $20,000 to be applied to his student loan debt. He is also \nparticipating in a loan forgiveness program that requires he make consistent payments \nover a ten-year period, at which time, the balance will be forgiven. I find all of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with detailed explanations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old.

The \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He has worked for his current government contractor-\nemployer since April 2018 as an aircraft mechanic. He is seeking his first security \nclearance. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is engaged and has four children. (Tr. 6, \n20, 27-28; GE 1; AE B) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline J, Applicant\u2019s 12 different arrests starting in \n2000 and ending in 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l). Three of these arrests occurred when \nApplicant was a juvenile. The most serious arrests include: in June 2012, an arrest and \ncharge for distribution and possession of a controlled substance; in May 2013, an arrest \nand charge for an assault causing bodily injury; in September 2013, an arrest and \ncharge for failure to obey a police officer and resisting arrest; and in April 2017, an \narrest and charge for impeding the breathing of a house member (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j-1.l). \nAll these allegations were also cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nAs stated above, Applicant admitted all the allegations and during his testimony \naccepted responsibility for his actions. He committed to being a changed man since he \nengaged in this criminal conduct as a teenager and into his 20s. By way of explanation, \nhe described his difficult upbringing. He and his siblings were raised by his \ngrandparents because his parents were not in the picture. They lived in a rough intercity \nneighborhood. His grandmother passed away when he was 17, so his grandfather \nbecame his primary care giver through high school. He served as Applicant\u2019s role \nmodel. His grandfather passed away in 2010 when Applicant was still in college and \nthat started some difficult times and bad decisions by him. (Tr. 19-22) \nApplicant is the first of his family to graduate from college. He bought a home a \nyear ago where he lives with his fianc\u00e9 and his kids. While he does not associate with \nanyone in his old neighborhood where he grew up, he does mentor high-risk kids from \nthat neighborhood to provide them guidance so that they can avoid trouble-filled paths. \nHe also participates in fundraising events that help fund scholarship programs for these \nkids.

He has one employee who transports \nvehicles to various parts of the country. The business has been very successful to date, \nearning him between $70,000 and $90,000 per year in extra income. He is also in the \nprocess of selling an investment property that he \u201cflipped\u201d and that will also generate \nadditional income. (Tr. 55-58; AE C) \nApplicant is well thought of by his employer as evidenced by three letters of \nrecommendation he submitted from a supervisor and two coworkers. Applicant\u2019s current \nsupervisor described him as having \u201cthe highest moral character.\u201d He also stated that \nApplicant is well respected by his coworkers and is a leader for his work group. The \nsupervisor has held a security clearance for 30 years and recommended that Applicant \nalso receive a clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.    \nApplicant has a long history of criminal conduct going back to when he was a \njuvenile. His admissions and documentary evidence establish both disqualifying \nconditions. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant came from a difficult childhood upbringing and allowed that situation to \ninfluence him resulting in bad decisions through his teenage years and early 20s. He \nended up committing these various criminal offenses. However, since 2017, he has got \nhis life on the right track with a good job, purchasing a home, starting a viable second-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincome business, and staying out of any further trouble. His supervisor and coworkers \npraise his qualities and support his effort to obtain a clearance. Recognizing the \ndifficulties he experienced as a youth, he has taken upon himself the role of mentoring \nat-risk-youths so that they can avoid the pitfalls he encountered. Based upon the above, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges the same conduct also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a under Guideline \nJ. By the explicit language of both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d), since Guideline J is \nspecifically applicable to the alleged conduct, those AGs do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \nHowever, if they did apply, Applicant\u2019s conduct would be mitigated for the same reasons \nstated under the Guideline J discussion above, and by the application of AGs \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) \nand 17(d). He accepted responsibility for his past criminal behavior and changed his life \nby becoming a good citizen who mentors at-risk-youths. So much time has passed \nsince Applicant\u2019s last criminal act, and he has reformed his life so much that similar acts \nare unlikely to recur. Therefore, his remote criminal actions do not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s good character, his mentoring, and his clean criminal record since 2017. \nThe criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated and personal conduct security \nconcerns were either not applicable or were mitigated. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated all the security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs      1.a \u2013 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph        2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a \u2013 4.g, all without further comment. He denied the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 4.h, 4.i, and 4.j, all with narrative explanations. He did not answer SOR \u00b6 2.b, but it is a cross-allegation of subparagraphs \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, both of which he admitted. Applicant\u2019s admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 48 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Tr. 52) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He has taken subsequent graduate classes and is about four credits shy of a master\u2019s degree.

(GE 5) Applicant also submitted a Declaration for Federal Employment (DFE) in September 2018. (GE 4) From 2007 until July 2012, Applicant worked in various classified positions with a variety of defense contractors.

The sole allegation under Guideline K \nis also mitigated as an isolated incident. However, personal conduct security concerns \nunder Guideline E over Applicant\u2019s employment record as a whole, as well as his lack of \ncandor during the security clearance process, are not mitigated. That conclusion also \nprecludes a finding that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is mitigated under Guideline J, \nsince falsification of a security clearance application constitutes subsequent criminal \nconduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant seeks renewed eligibility for a security clearance. On November 20, \n2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant alleging security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline K (Handling Protected Information), and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).

The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2021. On June 11, 2021, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for July 6, 2021. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled.

He did not answer SOR \u00b6 2.b, but it is a cross-allegation \nof subparagraphs \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, both of which he admitted. Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nexplanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Tr. 52) \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He has taken subsequent graduate classes and \nis about four credits shy of a master\u2019s degree. (Tr. 53, 63; GE 3 at 11-12) \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history is detailed in security clearance applications \n(SCAs) he submitted in connection with his employment, in January 2010 (GE 1), \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 2015 (GE 2), and January 2018 (GE 3) and an SF-85P application for a \nposition of public trust in September 2018. (GE 5) Applicant also submitted a \nDeclaration for Federal Employment (DFE) in September 2018. (GE 4) \nFrom 2007 until July 2012, Applicant worked in various classified positions with a \nvariety of defense contractors. (GE 1 at 17-22, 46, GE 2 at 15) He has held various \npositions in the IT field, mostly as a contractor, in the years since. Since July 2017, \nApplicant has worked for his current employer and clearance sponsor, defense \ncontractor S. (GE 5 at 10) He has held a clearance for about 15 years, and he also \nholds a clearance with another government agency (AGA). (Tr. 13, 53-54, 141-142) At \nthe time of the hearing, he had an annual salary of $120,000. (Tr. 143) \n3 \n \nFrom July 2012 to July 2013, Applicant worked for another department of the \nU.S. Government as an information security specialist. He testified that he had \nnationwide responsibility for IT security regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), \nworking with each of the 50 states. He described the experience as \u201ca nightmare.\u201d He \nhad no prior government experience, and little to no support. He said he had \u201cno idea \nwhat to do.\u201d He missed deadlines and acknowledged that he \u201cfailed to perform up to the \nexpectations\u201d of the job. He said it was \u201ccompletely my fault.\u201d (Tr. 55-57) Following a \nwritten warning in January 2013, Applicant was terminated from that position in July \n2013 for unsatisfactory performance. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.f, 4.g) (GE 2 at 13-14) As Department \nCounsel acknowledged, the \u201cinternet rollout\u201d of the ACA had significant problems, as \nwas widely publicized at the time, and Applicant was by no means solely responsible. \n(Tr. 98-99) Applicant said he did not have any personality conflicts, and praised the \ninterpersonal and professional skills of his co-workers there. (Tr. 99-100) \n \nShortly thereafter, in July 2013, Applicant began working for government \ncontractor C. He said he loved his job, which involved travelling to Army bases \nnationwide and testing IT equipment. He also said the job was in a very stressful \nenvironment with lots of travel and little sleep. He said he did not get along with his \nboss. Following two written warnings, in September 2013 and December 2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n4.f, 4.e), Applicant was placed on a probationary performance plan. In about April 2014, \nhe and his boss got into a heated argument. Applicant was terminated soon thereafter \nfor failing to perform to expectations and for losing his temper. (SOR \u00b6 4.c) (GE 2 at 12-\n13, GE 7; Tr. 58-59, 101-102) He did not dispute his employer\u2019s version of his work \nperformance. (Tr. 60) He believes they were looking to get him to resign. (Tr. 101-102) \n \n \nIn June 2014, Applicant began working part time for another federal contractor, \nT. (GE 2 at 11; Tr. 60-62, 107-110) Beginning in December 2015, he also began \nworking full time for another contractor, M. (Tr. 61-62) He worked both jobs until July \n2017, when he was terminated by contractor T for unsatisfactory performance, after he \nmissed some important deadlines for the customer (another large defense contractor) \nbecause he did not have enough time to devote to the work. (SOR \u00b6 4.a) (Tr. 61-62, \n110-112) However, Applicant was otherwise well-regarded by contractor T.

He said \nhe was not in a \u201cSCIF\u201d (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) but did have \naccess to what he called a \u201csimulated\u201d SIPRNet, which he asserted had not been fully \naccredited. (Tr. 108-109; Answer) While there, he received an unclassified e-mail from \nMs. M, his government supervisor, the contractor office\u2019s representative (COR). (Tr. 44) \nThe e-mail listed all of the names of the systems within the lab that were supported by \nhis then employer. Some of the systems processed classified information. The e-mail \nwas labeled as \u201cunclassified,\u201d but the spreadsheet document contained the names of \nsome classified systems. (Tr. 36) Applicant was supposed to complete appropriate \n\u201cpatches\u201d for that particular week on the document and then return it to Ms. M, per her \ninstructions, which he did. (Tr. 36, 46; Answer) \nApplicant acknowledged in his testimony that he should have encrypted the list \nwhen he returned it, but he said the list was also not encrypted when he got it. \u201cI didn\u2019t \nthink it needed to be encrypted because of the publically available information and there \nwas no classified information in the e-mail.\u201d (Tr. 47) He said that he believes that the \nCOR should have known that \u201cshe was setting someone up for aggregation\u201d of \nclassified information. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant also denied that any classified spillage took place, because \u201cnowhere \nwithin the SEC community classification guide does it say that the names of any \nclassified systems were themselves classified.\u201d (Tr. 42) This assertion is unsupported. \nHe said it was the aggregation of certain information that was classified. (Tr. 43) He \ndenied moving any classified information onto an unclassified system. (Tr. 44; Answer) \n \nApplicant said he was he was \u201caccused of committing aggregated spillage.\u201d He \nindicated in his testimony and in his Answer that he was pressured to sign a security \nform acknowledging culpability for the spill. (Answer) He believes he was \u201cintimidated \ninto telling the government that it was my fault and [that] I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d (Tr. 37, \n48) The security form referenced by Applicant is not in evidence.  \nThe Government\u2019s evidence includes a May 10, 2017 memo from the Army \ncommand to Applicant\u2019s employer that names Applicant as \u201cthe originator of a classified \nspillage that occurred on 5 May 2017.\u201d (GE 8 at 3; GE 8 at 6) In its memo, the Army \ncited Army Regulation 25-2, Information Management, Information Assurance, \nParagraph 4-14, Personnel Security Standards; subparagraph b.(6): \u201cNew, credible, \nderogatory information revokes any standing waiver and results in immediate denial of \naccess to IT systems.\u201d (GE 6 at 3) \nAs a result, Applicant\u2019s access to the government customer\u2019s information \ntechnology (IT) system was suspended that day, pending the results of an Army inquiry. \n(GE 8 at 3) As a result, Applicant could not perform his duties for contractor M, so he \nwas terminated, on May 12, 2017.

(Tr. 50-51, \n103-104) He continues to believe that the information at issue in the incident was not in \nfact classified; and he attested that others working in the lab told him this as well. (Tr. \n106-107) However, Applicant stated at the hearing that he acknowledged to his \nemployer at the time that he was culpable for the incident.

(Tr. 103-104) He said he \u201cstrongly disagreed with the decision to \nterminate him, and he said he \u201cdid not spill or aggregate classified information.\u201d He \nbelieves that the government supervisor should have \u201cretracted\u201d (i.e., redacted) or \nencrypted the information. (Tr. 37-39) He said he was not aware of the result of any \ngovernment investigation into the incident, and he is not aware that his clearance itself \nwas ever suspended. (Tr. 54-55, 139) Nor is there documentation of any such \ninvestigation in the record. \nApplicant said he had no other employment issues at contractor M before he was \nterminated over the spillage incident. (Tr. 107) He said he was told he was eligible for \nrehire. (Tr. 37) Applicant also noted his stellar security record, with no violations, and \nsaid this would not happen again. (Tr. 39-40) \nThe Government did not offer testimony of any expert witness in the security field \nregarding whether the spillage was in fact classified; whether it was due to Applicant\u2019s \nculpability; whether Applicant\u2019s actions were deliberate, negligent, or inadvertent; and \nwhat damage to national security resulted from the spill, if any. Beyond the May 2017 \nletter from the Army on the matter (GE 8), the Government offered no evidence of the \nconclusions of any investigating authorities. Nor did the Government offer any testimony \nabout applicability of any of the NISPOM paragraphs cited in the SOR. \nGuidelines J & G: \nIn August 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol. (DUI) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He explained that he was drinking at a pub one \nevening and was pulled over on his way home after making a left turn at a red light. He \nfailed a roadside breathalyzer test. He was cited or ticketed, and allowed to take a cab \nhome. He said he was not arrested.

Applicant acknowledged at his hearing that he had had too \nmuch to drink, and that it was \u201ccompletely my fault.\u201d (Tr. 66) He pleaded guilty and was \nsentenced to two years of probation.

(GE 5) The record does not contain a subsequent \nbackground interview after GE 4 and GE 5. \nThe Guideline E allegations in the SOR concern Applicant\u2019s allegedly deliberate \nfailure to disclose some of his arrests and some of his employment terminations on his \nJanuary 2018 SCA and his September 2018 SF-85P application. Applicant denied all \nallegations of deliberate falsification in the SOR. (Answer; Tr. 74) \nAlleged Falsifications relating to Arrests:  \nSOR \u00b6 4.h alleges in part, that in answering a series of questions on his January \n2018 SCA with a seven-year timeframe (\u201cIn the past seven (7) years \u2026\u201d), Applicant \nfailed to disclose his first DUI in 2007. (GE 3 at 35) During questioning at his hearing, it \nbecame clear that Applicant had no duty to disclose that offense in answer to those \nquestions, since it occurred in 2007, 11 years prior. (Tr. 75-82) \nApplicant acknowledged, however, that he also did not list his 2007 DUI in \nanswer to other questions on GE 3, such as \u201cOther than those offenses already listed, \nhave you EVER had the following happen to you? . . . Have you EVER been charged \nwith an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d (GE 1 at 37) Falsification of that question \nwas not alleged in the SOR. \n \nApplicant had disclosed his 2007 DUI on his 2010 SCA, and detailed the \ncircumstances of the arrest, his court case, and alcohol awareness program. (GE 1 at \n43-45; Tr. 96-98) He did not list the 2007 DUI on his 2015 SCA, in answer to a question, \n\u201cHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs.\u201d (GE 2 at 31-\n32) When asked why he did not list the 2007 DUI in answer to that question, Applicant \nsaid he \u201cmust have misinterpreted the question and that it was another seven-year \nquestion.\u201d He asserted that he would not have \u201cintentionally tried to hide something I \nalready [had] previously disclosed.\u201d (Tr. 115, 116) This omission was not alleged in the \nSOR as a deliberate falsification.   \nApplicant also explained that when he was interviewed in 2015 about his \nprevious SCA, he was told by the interviewing agent that he did not have to discuss his \n2007 DUI after that interview. (Tr. 75-78, 117-118) Applicant also volunteered the 2007 \nDUI in his September 2018 background interview (GE 6 at 10) and listed it on his \nSeptember 2018 SF-85P. (GE 5 at 27) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \nOn his January 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed his 2017 DUI, but did not disclose \nhis November 2017 probation violation arrest for the attempted gun purchase.

He asserted that he told his security chief and program \nmanager about it, but this is uncorroborated. He denied intentionally failing to disclose it \nand said he must have overlooked it or misinterpreted the question. (Tr. 82) However, \nApplicant acknowledged that in January 2018, the charge from the November 2017 \nprobation violation was pending, and had yet to be adjudicated. (Tr. 144-147) As such, \nhe should have disclosed it in answer to the question, \u201cAre you currently on trial or \nawaiting a trial on criminal charges.\u201d (GE 3 at 35) That omission, however, was not \nalleged in the SOR as a deliberate falsification. The summary of Applicant\u2019s September \n2018 background interview reflects that he voluntarily disclosed the arrest and the \nviolation to the interviewer. (GE 6 at 9) \n \nWhen he prepared his September 27, 2018 SF-85-P, Applicant disclosed both \nthe 2007 DUI arrest and the 2017 DWI arrest, but, again, not the subsequent 2017 \nprobation violation arrest, in answer to a question about his criminal history with a \nseven-year timeframe. (SOR \u00b6 4.j) Of this omission, Applicant said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I \nwould intentionally deny it. Maybe because it hadn\u2019t gone to trial yet, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d (Tr. \n83) In fact, the document regarding Applicant\u2019s completion of the 10 hours of work \nrelease shows a trial date of March 27, 2018, and that he completed the required \ncommunity service a month later, so the charge was no longer pending by September \n2018.

(GE 5) In answer to a question calling for \ndisclosure of all employment terminations in the past seven years, Applicant disclosed \nhis 2017 termination from contractor M (SOR \u00b6 4.b), but he did not disclose his other \nterminations, from contractor T in July 2017; from contractor C in April 2014 (SOR \u00b6 \n4.c); or from his federal job in January 2013 (SOR \u00b6 4.g). \nWhen asked why he did not disclose these other terminations on GE 5, Applicant \ntestified that he had filled out a lot of SCAs and SF-85Ps in the past, and believed he \nhad disclosed them previously. He asserted that the errors he made on his various \napplications were honest mistakes, and were not an attempt to \u201cobfuscate any sins or \npast indiscretions whatsoever.\u201d (Tr. 91) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn his 2015 SCA, Applicant disclosed his termination from another government \ndepartment and provided extensive details.

He disclosed his 2017 termination from \ncontractor M, said that he \u201cleft by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct,\u201d noted the spillage incident, and said he had been removed from the \ncontract, but was subject to rehire. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. 125) \n \nOn his January 2018 SCA, Applicant also noted other terminations, from \ncontractor C, in April 2014 and from the federal department job, in July 2013, but he \ngave no details. (GE 3 at 17-18) He also answered \u201cNo\u201d in answering questions calling \nfor disclosure of adverse circumstances (if he was fired, quit, or left by mutual \nagreement following allegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance). (GE 3 at \n27) Applicant explained that, he was confused by the page break in the middle of the \npage that he filled out, and did not realize he should have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the \nquestion, since he knew he had been fired by contractor C. (Tr. 126-129) No \nemployment-termination-related falsifications of GE 3 are alleged in the SOR.  \nApplicant discussed his various terminations during his September 13, 2018 \nbackground interview. (GE 6 ay 6-7). However, on his September 27, 2018 SF-85P, \nsubmitted only two weeks later, Applicant did not disclose his terminations from \ncontractor C and contractor T, both of which had occurred during the previous seven \nyears, in answer to a question calling for disclosure of those events. (GE 5 at 22). \nCuriously, Applicant disclosed his July 2017 termination from contractor M, which \noccurred within the seven-year timeframe of the question, but also two other \nterminations from many years before, in 2002 and 2005. (GE 5 at 22; Tr. 137) Applicant \nagain acknowledged that he should have disclosed the terminations from contractors C \nand T, but asserted that his omissions were unintentional. (Tr. 137-138) Applicant \nexpressed remorse for his errors and apologized for them. (Tr. 147-148, 161-162) \nApplicant also did not list his terminations from contractors C, M, and T on his \nDeclaration for Federal Employment, in September 2018, despite the presence of a \nquestion calling for disclosure of all employment terminations in the last five years. (GE \n4 at Question 12). As to this form, Applicant explained that he thought the question he \nwas only being asked to disclose terminations from \u201ca federal job or a government job \nwithin the last five years. That\u2019s how I looked at the question.\u201d (Tr. 134-135) Applicant \nmaintained his interpretation of the question under additional questioning at hearing. \n(Tr. 135-136) \nAmong the documents Applicant submitted after the hearing was a DFE that he \nsubmitted in April 2020. (AE G) On that form, he checked \u201cYes\u201d to a question asking if, \nduring the last seven years, he had been convicted, imprisoned, been in prison, been \non probation or been on parole. The question \u201cincludes felonies, firearms or explosives \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nviolations, misdemeanors, and all other offenses.\u201d (AE G at Q. 9) He reported an \noffense as follows: \nQuestion 9: Misdemeanor DUI 5/17/----\n2019 [City B, State X]. 2. Year\nprobation completed August 2019. No further issues\u201d followed by a phone\nnumber (AE G at 2) (Emphasis added).  \n \n \nThe year of the offense given, 2019, is likely an error, as probation ended only \nmonths later, in August 2019, and there was no discussion at hearing of a May 2019 \nDUI. I conclude that he likely meant to disclose his 2017 DUI on AE G. Yet Applicant \nalso did not list his November 2017 arrest for the probation violation on AE G, in answer \nto this question with a seven-year timeframe, and also said that probation was \ncompleted with \u201cno other issues.\u201d   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAE G also contained a question asking, in part, \nDuring the last five years, have you been fired for a job for any reason, did \nyou quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job \nbecause of specific problems, or were you debarred from Federal \nemployment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal \nagency? (AE G at Q. 12) \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d and disclosed his May 2017 termination from \ncontractor M \u201cper request of the Government COR for allegedly mishandling sensitive \ninformation; eligible for rehire.\u201d (AE G at 2) He did not disclose his termination from \ncontractor T, in July 2017. Since Applicant submitted AE G post-hearing, he was not \nquestioned about any of these answers. \nSince his termination following the spillage incident in May 2017, Applicant has \nsubsequently participated in extensive annual training required for his position. After the \nhearing, he provided extensive documentation of his remedial and other security \ntraining on numerous subjects related to his professional position. (Tr. 140; AE F, AE H) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 performance review reflects that he exceeds expectations \nacross the board. He performed \u201cextraordinary work\u201d under difficult circumstances. He \nis a highly trained and capable security professional and greatly contributed to the \nmission\u2019s success. (AE A)  \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case, as Applicant \nhas a DUI arrest in 2007 and a DUI arrest in 2017: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder.   \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nApplicant incurred two alcohol-related driving offenses ten years apart. After the \nsecond, more recent charge, he actively participated in a 26-week outpatient substance-\nabuse treatment program, and completed it successfully. Since then, he has curtailed \nhis drinking and has demonstrated a track record of responsible use, as he consumes \nalcohol occasionally on holidays at home, and there is no indication that he drinks and \ndrives.  He accepted responsibility for his behavior, and has taken steps to moderate his \ndrinking. His alcohol consumption no longer casts doubt on his current judgment, \ntrustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b) and 23(d) apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related offenses, noted above, are cross-alleged as \ncriminal conduct security concerns.

AG \u00b6 31(d) applies to the probation violation. \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest for violating probation is an added consideration under \nGuideline J, along with his two alcohol offenses. On the one hand, an arrest for a \nprobation violation is a serious matter, particularly one concerning the attempted \npurchase of a firearm. However, the circumstances of the violation appear isolated and \ninadvertent, as Applicant testified that he was not allowed to purchase a firearm out of \nstate while on probation, and he did so only as a gift for his father. Applicant is not a gun \nenthusiast and does not own guns himself. He also acknowledged that, while his \nactions were inadvertent, he should have read his probation instructions more carefully. \nMoreover, his probation was not extended, and the arrest had little impact beyond \nassignment of 10 hours of community service, which he completed. Applicant otherwise \ncompleted probation successfully in August 2019, more than two years ago. \nThese circumstances suggest that Applicant\u2019s offenses are mitigated under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d). However, I must also consider whether Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \nis mitigated in light of my conclusions under Guideline E with respect to the falsification \nallegations (discussed below). Falsification of a security clearance application is a \ncriminal offense under 18 USC \u00a7 1001. Since I conclude that Applicant falsified his \nSCA, that cuts against mitigation of the alleged criminal conduct here. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n32(d) therefore do not fully apply. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern regarding handling protected \ninformation: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; and \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information. \nThe sole Guideline K allegation in the SOR, with identifying information redacted, \nreads as follows: \n3.a. You improperly e-mailed a file containing classified information via an \nunclassified network in about May 2017, while employed with [contractor \nM, at a U.S. Army facility] creating a data spill in violation of paragraphs 4-\n200, 4-210b, and 5-100 of the Department of Defense [Manual] 5200.22M, \nNational Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). You \nwere consequently terminated in about May 2017.  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, and his testimony, Applicant did not agree that the \ninformation at issue was in fact classified. He denied that any spillage took place, \nthough he admitted that aggregation of certain information was classified, and therefore \nhe should have encrypted the information. Applicant\u2019s testimony about the nature of the \ninformation at issue in the spillage information is uncorroborated. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence includes a May 10, 2017 memo from the Army \ncommand to Applicant\u2019s employer that names Applicant as \u201cthe originator of a classified \nspillage that occurred on 5 May 2017.\u201d (GE 8 at 3) The termination memo from \nApplicant\u2019s employer also notes that the spillage was inadvertent. \n14 \n \nThe Government did not offer testimony of any expert witness in the security field \nregarding whether the information involved in the spillage was in fact classified; whether \nit was due to Applicant\u2019s culpability; whether Applicant\u2019s actions were deliberate, \nnegligent, or inadvertent; and what damage to national security resulted from the spill, if \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany. Beyond the May 10, 2017 Army memo, the Government did not offer any evidence \nof the conclusions of any investigating authorities. Nor did the Government offer any \ntestimony about applicability of any of the NISPOM paragraphs cited in the SOR. \nWith that as the state of the evidence, I conclude that it is more likely than not \nthat when Applicant returned the e-mail to the COR, his government supervisor, Ms. M, \nhe sent the information in an unclassified e-mail. The information was likely classified, at \nleast in aggregate form. Applicant should therefore have sent it through proper means. \nWhen he did not do so, this caused a \u201cclassified spill,\u201d albeit an isolated, inadvertent \none, for which Applicant was responsible. Since Applicant\u2019s actions involved \n\u201ctransmitting, or otherwise handling protected information, including images, on any \nunauthorized equipment or medium,\u201d AG \u00b6 34(c) applies. AG \u00b6 34(g) also applies. \nIn SOR \u00b6 3(a), the Government also alleges that Applicant\u2019s actions violated \ncertain specific paragraphs in the NISPOM. The most recent version of the NISPOM \nwas issued in February 2006 (change 2, May 16, 2016). The Government did not offer \nany explanatory testimony about applicability of the three NISPOM paragraphs noted in \nSOR \u00b6 3(a), and made no argument about them at hearing. Department Counsel \nprovided the requested excerpts after the hearing, at my request. (HE I) \nSince they are referenced, I briefly address each NISPOM paragraph alleged in \nthe SOR: 1) NISPOM para. 4-200 is a general paragraph in Section 2: Marking \nRequirements. 2) NISPOM para. 4-210b concerns \u201cE-mail and other electronic \nmessages.\u201d 3) NISPOM para. 5-100 is a general paragraph in section 1 of Chapter 5: \nSafeguarding Classified Information. Section 1: General Safeguarding Requirements, \nunder which \u201cContractors shall be responsible for safeguarding classified information \nunder their control.\u201d (HE I at pages 4-2-1; 4-2-3, and 5-1-1) There is insufficient \nevidence in the record to determine whether Applicant\u2019s actions violated these \nparagraphs. Indeed, it is not established that the reference to \u201ccontractors\u201d in these \nNISPOM provisions are intended to mean defense contractor employers (i.e., \ncompanies), or defense contractor employees (such as Applicant himself). \nNevertheless, the applicability of any particular NISPOM paragraph is not \nrequired to establish disqualifying conditions under Guideline K. AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(c) and 34(g) \nare established by the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 35 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline K: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nIt is not established that the spillage was due to improper or inadequate training \nor improper instructions. AG \u00b6 35(c) is not established. \nThe remaining mitigating conditions, however, all apply. There is no evidence \nthat the spillage was deliberate. Indeed, the termination memo from Applicant\u2019s \nemployer notes that the spillage was inadvertent. I therefore conclude that it was an \ninadvertent, isolated incident, and not part of a pattern of security violations. There is no \nevidence of compromise. There is no evidence of other security violations, either before, \nor since. Applicant has had a security clearance for many years. While his access to the \nArmy\u2019s IT systems was revoked, there is no indication that his access to classified \ninformation \nwas \nrevoked \nor suspended. \nApplicant \nalso \nprovided \nextensive \ndocumentation of subsequent security trainings in the years since the incident. Security \nviolations are always a serious matter, as they go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness. However, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), 35(b), and 35(d) apply to mitigate \nSOR \u00b6 3(a). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThe personal conduct allegations in the SOR are in two groups. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.g \nall concern warnings and terminations for employment performance issues. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.h, \n4.i, and 4.j all concern alleged falsifications on SCAs or other similar forms. \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.g. Each termination occurred between July \n2013 and July 2017. He provided explanations for each termination, and largely \naccepted responsibility, even if he did not always believe termination was warranted. \nHis terminations concerned a variety of performance issues, including a personality \nconflict with his supervisor, removal from government IT systems following a classified \nspillage, and general dissatisfaction by the customer. \nGenerally, an applicant\u2019s termination for poor performance is an employment \nmatter between the individual and the company that does not in and of itself implicate \npersonal conduct security issues, particularly where there is no evidence of \nquestionable judgment, dishonesty, or intentional failure to comply with rules and \nregulations. However, in addition to considering each termination independently, I must \nalso consider them together. In that regard, Applicant\u2019s terminations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.g) \nsuggest a pattern of employment issues whose security significance I cannot ignore. \nThe general personal conduct security concern in AG \u00b6 15 applies to all of the \nterminations, given the issues with Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment and compliance \nwith rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies to all but one of terminations and written warnings (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n4.a, 4.c-4.g) as credible adverse information not explicitly covered elsewhere. The \nexception is the termination from contractor M (SOR \u00b6 4.b). AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to that \ntermination, as it was mitigated under Guideline K as an isolated, inadvertent incident, \nyet it has independent security significance under Guideline E since a termination \nresulted. \nThis leaves the alleged falsifications. They relate to Applicant\u2019s arrest record \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.h and 4.j) and his employment terminations. (SOR \u00b6 4.i) \nAs discussed in the Facts section, above, Applicant had no duty to report his \n2007 DUI arrest in answer to a question with a seven-year timeframe on his January \n2018 SCA, since the arrest occurred 11 years earlier. SOR \u00b6 4.h is partially resolved for \nApplicant on that basis. \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, Applicant also did not disclose his November 2017 probation violation \narrest either in answer to that question (which was alleged as part of SOR \u00b6 4.h) or in \nanswer to another question on GE 3 asking about charges for which he was awaiting \ntrial (which was not alleged in the SOR). Applicant testified that his omission was \nunintentional, but I conclude that falsification is established. The arrest was quite recent, \nand he was pending trial at the time, which he surely knew. He may well have informed \nhis supervisor and his security manager, as he testified, but this is not corroborated, nor \ndoes it absolve him of the responsibility to disclose the offense on GE 3. As to the \nNovember 2017 probation violation arrest, SOR \u00b6 4.h is established and AG \u00b6 16(a) \napplies. \nSimilarly, Applicant failed to disclose that arrest on GE 5, his September 27, \n2018 SF-85P application for a position of public trust. This omission is particularly \ninexplicable, since he voluntarily disclosed the arrest during his background interview \nonly days earlier. Yet his explanation at his hearing that he did not disclose the arrest \nbecause he had not gone to trial yet is neither credible nor accurate, since he had gone \nto trial in April 2018, and completed his community service by a month later. As to SOR \n\u00b6 4.j, AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nSOR \u00b6 4.i alleges that when Applicant submitted his September 27, 2018 SF-85P \n(GE 5), he disclosed his 2017 termination from contractor M, but deliberately failed to \ndisclose other terminations that occurred in the previous seven years: from contractor T, \nin July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 4.a); from contractor C, in April 2014 (SOR \u00b6 4.c); and from federal \nemployment in July 2013 (SOR \u00b6 4.f). The fact that he disclosed the terminations on an \nearlier SCA, in January 2018, does not eliminate the need to disclose them on a \nsubsequent form, and Applicant has a duty to disclose them each time. \nIt is curious that Applicant chose to disclose other, earlier terminations, from \n2002 and 2005, in answer to an employment question on GE 5 with a seven-year \ntimeframe, yet failed to disclose terminations that did fall within that period. \nApplicant also did not list his terminations from contractors C, M, and T on his \nDeclaration for Federal Employment, in September 2018, despite the presence of a \nquestion calling for disclosure of all employment terminations in the last five years. (GE \n4 at Question 12). While these falsifications are not alleged in the SOR, I can consider \nthem in weighing his credibility, and in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person \nconcept. In that regard, Applicant explained that he thought the question only asked for \ndisclosure terminations from \u201ca federal job or a government job within the last five \nyears.\u201d (Tr. 134-135) This explanation is simply not credible, as there is no indication \nthat the plain language of the question is to be limited that way. I conclude that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose any of his employment terminations in the last \nfive years when he submitted GE 4, his DFE. \nThis evidence may not be considered disqualifying conduct, since it is not alleged \nin the SOR. But it also makes it more likely that Applicant also deliberately failed to \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n---\ndisclose all his terminations in the last seven years when he submitted GE 5 \u2013 which \nwas alleged in the SOR. I therefore conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 4.i.  \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nIn weighing mitigation, I look not only to the established falsifications alleged \nin the SOR, but to other instances of lack of candor, even if not alleged. In this \nregard, I note the following: \nApplicant failed to disclose his 2007 DUI on both his 2015 SCA and his \nJanuary 2018 SCA (in answer to the question \u201cHave you ever been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d); \nApplicant failed to disclose his November 2017 probation violation arrest, \nas a pending charge for which he was awaiting trial, on his January 2018 \nSCA; \nAs noted above, Applicant failed to disclose any employment terminations \nin the last five years on his September 2018 DFE; \nApplicant also failed to disclose his November 2017 probation violation \narrest on his September 2018 DFE; and \nApplicant also failed to disclose either his November 2017 probation \nviolation or his July 2017 termination from contractor T on AE G, his April \n2020 DFE, submitted post-hearing. \nIn considering Applicant\u2019s answers for his various omissions, I did not find \nseveral of them credible. On several occasions, he said he \u201cmust have\u201d \nmisinterpreted or overlooked the question. He asserted on one occasion that one \nquestion called only for disclosure of terminations related to federal employment. \nHe asserted one occasion to have been confused by a page break. I found that his \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexplanations were often attempts to justify his omissions after the fact, more than \nthey were explanations of his state of mind at the time. In this regard, many of his \nexplanations did not ring true. And he still did not disclose the probation violation \narrest or one of his recent terminations on AE G, which he prepared in April 2020. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. Given my concerns about Applicant\u2019s candor, \nhe did not establish that his falsifications are unlikely to recur, or that they no longer \ncast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. The same is true of his \nemployment record, which establishes a pattern of security significant conduct that \nhe has not mitigated.  \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Even though Applicant discussed his arrests and \nhis employment terminations in his background interview, and did so voluntarily, his \nbackground interview was in September 2018, months after his January 2018 SCA, \nand also after his probation violation arrest had been adjudicated. It also does not \napply to the other established falsifications, which he did not acknowledge. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, J, K, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is highly intelligent, well educated, and has had a long career in the \ndefense industry with a security clearance. He is well regarded at work, and his \nperformance exceeds expectations across the board. This evidence weighs in his favor. \nWhile the allegations under the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct and handling \nprotected information guidelines are mitigated and resolved, I nevertheless have \nunresolved concerns under personal conduct and the whole-person concept about his \nemployment history and his lack of candor. I have examined all the evidence regarding \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nthe SOR allegations not only individually, but also taken together, so as not to consider \nthem in a piecemeal fashion, not only under the guidelines alleged, but also with due \nconsideration under the whole-person concept. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline K:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.h:  \nFor Applicant (in part) and  \nAgainst Applicant (in part) \nSubparagraphs 4.i-4.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In addition to her admissions, she provided explanations and submitted two documents from a substance abuse treatment provider with her response to the SOR; one dated August 11, 2017, and the other dated March 7, 2018. (Answer) Applicant is 46 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1996. She was divorced from her first husband in 2004. They have four daughters, ages 27, 25, 21, and 18. She remarried her second spouse in 2011. Since August 2018, she is employed by a federal contractor as a CATS analyst, but because it is a small company, she performs a variety of employment duties, to include assistant facility security officer. She held a DOD security clearance from 2006 when she was first employed by a federal contractor. In 2010 she worked for a different federal contractor until she was laid off in October 2016. She is required to possess a security clearance to perform specific job duties for her employer.

The \ncase was assigned to me on October 15, 2021. Applicant obtained an attorney, and the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 2, \n2022, setting the hearing for March 22, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3; and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J. All proffered exhibits \nwere admitted into evidence without objection, except for specific portions of AE H and I, \naddressed below. I held the record open for two weeks in the event either party wanted \nto supplement the record with additional documentation. Post-hearing, Applicant timely \nsubmitted a personal statement labeled AE K, which was admitted without objection. The \nGovernment requested an extension of time to submit documentation, which was granted, \nand the record was held open until April 19, 2022. Department Counsel timely submitted \nthree police reports labeled GE 4 through 6, which were admitted into the record without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 29, 2022, and the record \nclosed on April 20, 2022. \nOn March 21, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a Motion in Limine in \nconnection with Applicant\u2019s proposed exhibits H and I, i.e., \u201cDetermination Letter from \n(name omitted),\u201d along with cited Enclosures 1 & 2. The Government concerns were \ntwofold; first, the licensed clinical social worker listed on her resume that she is \u201ccertified \nby the Department of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).\u201d The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) does not \u201ccertify\u201d any professionals as a particular subject matter \nexpert. Therefore, the claim made by Applicant\u2019s expert witness is incorrect. Applicant\u2019s \nwitness has been accepted as an expert witness in other DOHA cases. Second, \nDepartment Counsel stated that this individual also used the adjudicative guidelines to \ndraw legal conclusions with respect to whether security concerns outlined in the SOR \nhave been mitigated based on the information she collected solely from the Applicant. It \nwas the Government\u2019s position that it is irrelevant and improper for this witness to provide \nan application of the facts to the adjudicative guidelines, and to offer an assertion that the \nsecurity concerns have been fully mitigated in this particular case. This responsibility is \nexclusively for the DOHA judge. Applicant\u2019s counsel conceded that their expert\u2019s claim of \nbeing DOHA certified was troubling. She requested that I not consider any opinion offered \non the adjudicative guidelines by their witness, and to focus only on her medical \nevaluation of the Applicant that was within her realm of professional expertise. I granted \nthe Government\u2019s motion and accepted Applicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s concession that I not \nconsider the witness as a certified DOHA subject-matter expert or give weight to her \nexpert \nopinioin \nthat security concerns are mitigated, or that Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance should be granted. (Tr. 8-13) I will, however, consider her opinion on \napplication to the adjudicative guidelines as I would consider the opinioin of any lay \nwitness on these matters.   \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR, (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, and 2.a.), but \nshe denied the single allegation under Guideline E.

In addition to her admissions, \nshe provided explanations and submitted two documents from a substance abuse \ntreatment provider with her response to the SOR; one dated August 11, 2017, and the \nother dated March 7, 2018. (Answer) \nApplicant is 46 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1996. She was \ndivorced from her first husband in 2004. They have four daughters, ages 27, 25, 21, and\n18. She remarried her second spouse in 2011. Since August 2018, she is employed by a\nfederal contractor as a CATS analyst, but because it is a small company, she performs a \nvariety of employment duties, to include assistant facility security officer. She held a DOD\nsecurity clearance from 2006 when she was first employed by a federal contractor. In\n2010 she worked for a different federal contractor until she was laid off in October 2016.\nShe is required to possess a security clearance to perform specific job duties for her \nemployer. (Tr. 24-31; GE 1, GE 3) \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). She disclosed a July 2015 driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI) arrest. In October 2017, a government investigator conducted a background \ninterview with Applicant. They discussed Applicant\u2019s listed July 2015 DUI arrest. She \nvolunteered that she had been arrested in September 2016 and charged with a second \nDUI, which was discussed. A third DUI arrest was developed, and she admitted after \nquestioning that she had been arrested in June 2017, but that she had not yet appeared \nin court. On July 15, 2020, Applicant reviewed the interview report and certified the \ninformation provided therein was accurate and true. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 43) \nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, \nsince about age 15 to at least July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). During the October 2017 \nbackground interview, Applicant stated that she began consuming alcohol regularly in her \nearly 30s and drank a half bottle of wine three to four times a week. She believed her \nconsumption of alcohol was not excessive. After her first DUI arrest in July 2015 (\u00b6 1.b), \ncounseling helped her stop drinking alcohol for a short period of time. She resumed her \nuse of alcohol to self-medicate when experiencing high levels of stress. Her alcohol \nconsumption continued despite her second DUI arrest in September 2016 (\u00b6 1.c). After \nher third arrest for DUI in June 2017 (\u00b6 1.e), she voluntarily admitted herself into a \nsubstance abuse rehabilitation center (\u00b6 1.f). She told the investigator that she does not \nintend to use alcohol in the future. (GE 3; Tr. 34-36, 40-46) \nApplicant responded to an alcohol interrogatory with attached medical records, \nwhich she completed in July 2020. She admitted that she drank alcohol again during \nChristmas 2019.

When asked if she would consent to taking a breathalyzer test, \nApplicant responded that if she took the test she would go to jail. She told the police officer \nthat she held a security clearance and if her employer found out she was \u201c[expletive].\u201d \nShe took the test and her blood alcohol content (BAC) registered 0.258. Applicant was \ntaken into custody and charged with DUI and violating a traffic control signal. She was \nultimately found guilty of DUI and she was placed into a diversion program with specific \nconditions to include enrolling into an alcohol treatment program and to not consume any \nalcohol while she was on her one-year probation. (GE 3; GE 5; Tr. 40-42, 79) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant explained the circumstances which resulted in her \nfirst DUI arrest. After she got off from work, she went to a bar and consumed some \nalcoholic drinks, but she could not recall how many she drank. Applicant was specifically \nasked if she had ever been under the influence of alcohol while working, and she replied; \n\u201cnever.\u201d Department Counsel asked Applicant if she had told the investigator during her \nbackground interview that she had consumed six shots of liquor before she was arrested \nfor her first DUI, and she admitted that was accurate. Department Counsel asked her if \nshe was aware that her BAC of 0.258 was more than three times over the legal limit, and \nApplicant said she was surprised by that information. When asked again whether she had \never reported to work under the influence of alcohol, Applicant admitted that a previous \nemployer had a private conversation with her about alcohol. When confronted with \ninformation developed from her background investigation from a previous employer, \nApplicant did not recall that her supervisor had found her in an intoxicated state on two \noccasions in October 2016, or that her husband had to pick her up and take her home on \nboth occasions. She also did not recall that in October 2016 her employer laid her off, in \npart, due to her excessive use of alcohol while on the job. (Tr. 40-44, 59, 77-78, 89-91) \nThe September 2016 police report disclosed a phone call was made about the \nwelfare of a woman who had gotten out of a parked vehicle and urinated, returned to her \ncar and passed out. When the police officers arrived at approximately 4:30 p.m., Applicant \nwas slumped over the steering wheel of a running car. The officers knocked on the \nwindow, nudged her shoulder, and reported that her cell phone was also ringing loudly. \nShe was unresponsive. Paramedics were called to the scene; the car was turned off; and \nthe keys were removed from the ignition. When an officer tried to get Applicant to rest \nback in her car seat, she opened her eyes. There was a strong odor of alcohol coming \nfrom her. The officer told Applicant that an emergency squad was coming and asked her \nwhat she had to drink. She responded that she drank two bottles of vodka. Applicant was \narrested and charged with DUI and parking on a curb. When she arrived at the station, \nher BAC registered 0.283. Ultimately, the DUI charge was dismissed but the court added \nan additional year of treatment to the 2015 diversion program requirements. Applicant \nhad violated the terms of her probation by consuming alcohol when the second alcohol-\nrelated arrest occurred.

She admitted that \nshe continued to consume alcohol during her treatment and against medical advice. She \nwas arrested for her third DUI a few months before the treatment program ended. (Tr. 42, \n44-45, 47-48) \nThe June 2017 police records disclosed that Applicant had moved her daughter\u2019s \ncar, and while turning at an intersection, she hit a street sign which damaged the car. She \ndid not report the accident to police. The police officer who had filed the 2017 report noted \nthat she previously had four contacts with Applicant, all involving alcohol, to include a DUI \narrest in 2016. When Applicant was asked if she had been drinking alcohol, Applicant \nstated \u201ca few sips of wine.\u201d She did not pass the field sobriety tests and was taken into \ncustody. Applicant registered 0.199 BAC at the station. She was charged with DUI and \nfailure to give information after striking unattended property. The day following the arrest \nApplicant admitted to the police officer that she had been to the liquor store and drank \u201ca \nvodka shooter\u201d prior to the accident. At the hearing Applicant stated that she was found \nguilty of DUI, fined, and she served 24 hours in jail. (Tr. 45-47; GE 6) \nApplicant testified that she had a cordial relationship with her ex-husband until \nabout 2015. At that time, he announced that he had military orders to move to another \nstate for about a year. He and his current wife would take their recreational vehicle (RV) \nand requested that the youngest daughter stay with them. Applicant refused to relinquish \ncustody of their youngest daughter, and in retaliation, he filed for full custody for their two \nyoungest daughters. She was in court frequently and the custody battle was contentious. \nShe started drinking alcohol more frequently during this time period while her life was very \nstressful. For several years she took prescribed antidepressant medication while \nconsuming alcohol. The first time she considered that she may have a problem with \nalcohol, occurred after she was arrested for her first DUI in 2015. She continued to \nconsume alcohol, in violation of her probation and against medical advice, until June \n2017, when she was arrested for her third DUI. (Tr. 36-39, 70, 75-76, 87-89) \nApplicant stated that she voluntarily admitted herself to an alcohol treatment center \nafter her third DUI arrest. The medical records disclosed Applicant\u2019s self-reported alcohol \nand prescription drug history. She began using alcohol at age 15. Her primary choice of \nalcohol was beer, vodka, and wine. She last used alcohol on the day of her admission, \nJuly 14, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., after drinking 10 shooters (shots of liquor). She reported to \npersonnel that she is unable to stop using alcohol without help. It also disclosed that her \ndrinking pattern consisted of drinking 10 to 20 shooters while on binges, about one day a \nweek for the last ten years. She enrolled into inpatient treatment for substance abuse in \n2016, but she was released after staying a few days because her insurance would not \ncover the cost of treatment. She had experienced alcohol-related blackouts, emotional \nproblems, family problems, marital conflict, and legal problems from abusing alcohol. \nApplicant was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder Severe, and Sedative Use Disorder \nSevere. She was discharged from the treatment facility on August 11, 2017. During the \nhearing, Applicant stated that the alcohol treatment center\u2019s diagnosis was questionable \nsince the facility coded her with a serious diagnosis in an effort to have her insurance \ncover her inpatient treatment.

(GE 2; Tr. 48-50, 59, 72-74, 82) \nApplicant relapsed after consuming alcohol at a 2019 Christmas party. She drank \ntwo glasses of wine with dinner. She was disappointed in herself for drinking alcohol \nbecause she had to start her sobriety clock all over again. Her husband was also upset \nwith her for drinking alcohol. She did not return to alcohol treatment or AA meetings. She \nsaid she does not need any assistance to maintain sobriety, and she has made many \npositive changes to live a healthier lifestyle. (GE 2; AE H; Tr. 51-55) \nApplicant provided an independent alcohol abuse evaluation from a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW), and certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC). The \nprofessional evaluator listed on her resume \u201cspecializing in security clearance evaluations \nand mental health treatment for federal government employees and contractors.\u201d As \npreviously stated, this report and the enclosures were the basis for the motion in limine \nfiled by Department Counsel. My review of these documents will be limited as indicated \npreviously. (GE H, GE I) \nThe alcohol evaluation took place on March 11, 2022, via live video feed, and \ninvolved standardized testing and a one-on-one personal interview. The report noted that \nin 1996, Applicant was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \ndepression, and anxiety. This diagnosis has continued throughout her life. She has been \nprescribed various medications over the years to treat her conditions. In 2015, Applicant \nexperienced excessive stressors after she and her ex-husband became involved in a \ncombative custody lawsuit, and she drank alcohol to relieve the tension. It was during this \ntime she was arrested for her first DUI in 2015. She stated that she was wearing \u201cvery \nhigh\u201d heeled shoes and failed the sobriety tests. She completed all the requirements for \nthe diversion program successfully. \nFor the second DUI, Applicant admitted that had a few drinks at a friend\u2019s house. \nAfter leaving her friend\u2019s house, she called her husband to pick her up because she was \naware that she should not be driving. She was arrested for DUI only after she admitted to \nthe police officer that she had consumed alcoholic drinks with her friend. Her diversion \nwas extended an additional year. The third DUI occurred because Applicant had to move \nher daughter\u2019s car to make room for a basketball game. Unbeknownst to her or her \ndaughter, her ex-husband had a \u201ctracker\u201d placed on the car. The stepmother called and \nasked the daughter why she was driving the car and the daughter apparently reported \nthat her mother had moved the car. The stepmother called police to report that Applicant \nwas illegally driving the car. The police arrived, and Applicant admitted to having two to \nfour glasses of wine prior to moving the car. She was arrested for DUI, she lost her driver\u2019s \nlicense, and was required to install an interlock device on her car once her driving \nprivileges were restored. There was no indication that the evaluator had any corroborating \ninformation, to include any of the police reports, and the only source of information used \nin the evaluation was supplied solely by Applicant. \nThe mental health professional wrote in the evaluation report: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201c\u2026It should be noted that when patients first enter treatment they may well \nbe diagnosed with a higher level of disorder, as was the case with Ms. \n(omitted) when she entered [alcohol treatment]. Often the scale used \nincludes a DUI or evidence of interactions with the law. However, it should \nbe noted that a diagnosis upon entry to treatment is not a static event. \nTreatment, education, spiritual healing, psychotherapy, community, and \nengagement in a healthy lifestyle will adjust the diagnosis accordingly.\u201d \nThere was no indication that the evaluator had corroborating information \nfrom [the alcohol treatment center] or a professional medical publication to \nsupport her opinion. (AE H) \nThe evaluator noted that Applicant had remained sober from July 2017 to \nDecember 2019 before her relapse. Applicant regretted the relapse and made a \ncommitment to never do so again. The evaluator diagnosed Applicant with moderate \nalcohol use disorder, in remission. It was her professional opinion that if Applicant \ncontinued with daily spiritual practices, attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, \nand continued engagement of a healthy lifestyle, Applicant had a very good prognosis for \nthe future. (AE H, AE I) \nPersonal Achievements and Recognition: \nApplicant submitted a September 2007 e-mail from a branch chief who lauded \nApplicant\u2019s accomplishments with a challenging work project, and recommended her for \na bonus due to her outstanding efforts. Applicant also submitted a March 2015 certificate \nof appreciation from the Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance Integration for her \nexemplary support. There was a photograph of Applicant receiving a CSC award, possibly \nthe 2010 winner of the CSC President\u2019s Award, as listed in her resume. (AE D, AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(g). \nApplicant was involved in three alcohol-related arrests in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and her \nBAC recordings were well over the legal limits, registering 0.258, 0.283, and 0.199. She \nwas diagnosed in 2017 with alcohol use disorder severe by a qualified medical or mental \nhealth professional, and she continued using alcohol in violation of the terms of her \nprobation and against medical advice while enrolled in court-ordered treatment. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant was involved in three alcohol-related arrests for three consecutive years \nand she registered alarmingly high BAC readings that were well above the legal limit. \nFollowing her first DUI, there was a court-ordered requirement that she abstain from using \nalcohol during her probationary period, to which she agreed. She failed to remain alcohol-\nfree, as required, which resulted in two additional alcohol-related arrests. She also \nconsumed alcohol while she was enrolled in court-ordered treatment and against medical \nadvice. She was arrested for a third alcohol-related offense a few months before \ncompleting the treatment program. She has repeatedly minimized her 2017 diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe 2015 police report noted that Applicant stated she had three alcoholic drinks \nduring lunch for her job. Also, when confronted by adverse information developed during \nthe course of her background investigation by her former employer, Applicant did not deny \nthe reported alcohol-related incidents at her place of employment, to include that her \nhusband was called on two occasions to pick her up due to her intoxicated state. She \nsaid she did not recall any of those incidents reported to the investigator and discussed \nduring the hearing. She did recollect having a private conversation with her former \nemployer concerning alcohol. \nApplicant completed 30 days of inpatient treatment in 2017, and she completed six \nmonths of aftercare treatment following her discharge. She attended a total of \napproximately ten AA meetings, but none since 2018 or after her relapse in December \n2019. Applicant provided self-serving details during her independent alcohol evaluation \nto the LCSW, which shows a lack of rehabilitation and weighs against continuance of her \nsecurity clearance. I agree with the LCSWs professional opinion that Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued attendance with AA (or any other professional and legitimate alcohol support \norganization) is needed, in part, for a future favorable prognosis. Applicant has not met \nthat criteria. Due to the severity of Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse, I believe more time is \nneeded to establish successful rehabilitation. Applicant failed to mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(d). Applicant was \ninvolved in three alcohol-related arrests in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and she continued \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nusing alcohol in violation of the terms of her probation and against medical advice while \nenrolled in court-ordered treatment. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct raises serious security concerns. Her willful and \ncontinued violations of her probation requirement to abstain from using alcohol, to include \nduring two years of court-ordered treatment, demonstrates that she has great difficulty \nrefraining from alcohol consumption, which has led to serious offenses. A DUI risks \nserious injury or death to others. There is insufficient evidence in the record to \ndemonstrate that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct will not recur. I find that more time is \nneeded to ensure that she does not repeat her excessive drinking in the event she \nencounters another stressful situation. As such, her criminal behavior continues to cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under the above mitigating conditions. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct\u2026 that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n11 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline G allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e are cross-alleged under Guideline \n\u00b6 2.a. Each of them is established by the record evidence. Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol \nabuse, three alcohol-related arrests, and her willful violations of her probation requirement \nto abstain from using alcohol support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and16(e)(1). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s remorse for her December 2019 relapse and her commitment to \ncontinued sobriety is admirable. She has notified security officials at her place of \nemployment about her alcohol-related misconduct. She has taken steps to reduce \nvulnerability by her disclosure of this adverse information, and as such, it is unlikely she \nwill be a target for exploitation. Applicant has successfully mitigated personal conduct \nsecurity concerns under \u00b6 17(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G, J, and E into my whole-person analysis. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nIn 2015, 2016, and 2017, Applicant was arrested for alcohol-related offenses and \nshe registered relatively high BAC readings during each incident, establishing binge \nalcohol consumption. She continued to consume alcohol in violation of her probation \nrequirement and against medical advice during her two years of court-ordered treatment. \nShe received a 2017 diagnosis of alcohol use disorder severe; she relapsed by drinking \nwine in December 2019; and she failed to return to AA meetings or obtain professional \nsupport considering her history of excessive alcohol use. More time is required before \nApplicant can be considered successfully rehabilitated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Although she mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 29-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to classified information for his job as a Linux system administrator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since April 2018, and this is the first time he has applied for a security clearance. He had a full-time job as a system administrator for a different company during 2014-2018. Before that, he had a part-time job as a web developer via a work-study program during 2012-2014. He was a university student during 2010-2016, and he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He is single with no children although he is engaged to be married in 2022. The SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of eight delinquent student-loan accounts in amounts ranging from $2,718 to $46,335 for a total of about $86,948. The three accounts with Navient are alleged to be charged off while the five accounts with the Department of Education are alleged to be in collection. Although Applicant formally denied the allegations in his answer to the SOR, he does not deny obtaining the loans but instead takes issue with the status of the various accounts. As alleged in the July 2020 SOR, the eight delinquent student loans are established by credit reports from July 2018 and October 2019.

He is single with \nno children although he is engaged to be married in 2022. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of eight delinquent \nstudent-loan accounts in amounts ranging from $2,718 to $46,335 for a total of about \n$86,948. The three accounts with Navient are alleged to be charged off while the five \naccounts with the Department of Education are alleged to be in collection. Although \nApplicant formally denied the allegations in his answer to the SOR, he does not deny \nobtaining the loans but instead takes issue with the status of the various accounts. As \nalleged in the July 2020 SOR, the eight delinquent student loans are established by \ncredit reports from July 2018 and October 2019. (Exhibits 4 and 3, respectively) \nA more recent credit report, offered by Department Counsel, from July 2021 \nshows an improving situation. (Exhibit 2) The report shows ten student loans with the \nDepartment of Education/Nelnet (which is a federal student loan servicer working on \nbehalf of the Department of Education) are in good standing. (Exhibit 2 at 1-4) The ten \naccounts have balances in amounts ranging from $1,332 to $4,446 for a total of about \n$27,876; none the accounts are past due; the status for all accounts is paid as agreed; \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the date of last payment for all accounts is June 2021, the month before the credit \nreported was obtained. \nThe three charged-off student loans with Navient are included in the July 2021 \nreport too. (Exhibit 2 at 5-6) The largest was charged off in the amount of $41,590 and \nhad a current balance of $44,853. The last payment on the account was made in March \n2021. The second was charged off in the amount of $14,983 and had a current balance \nof $15,483. The last payment on the account was made in March 2021. The third was \ncharged off in the amount of $5,519 and had a current balance of $0, as it is a paid \ncharged-off account. The last payment on the account was made in November 2020. In \nsummary, the July 2021 credit report shows Applicant had a total balance of about \n$60,336 on two accounts with Navient and the third account was paid. \nNote, the July 2021 credit report also shows two student loans with Sally Mae, \nboth are being paid as agreed, and both are joint accounts (with Applicant\u2019s parents as \nfar as I can determine). Likewise, Applicant Exhibit I pertains to the two Sally Mae loans, \nwhich are not alleged in the SOR or at issue in this case. \nApplicant provided more up to date information at the hearing via a January 2022 \ncredit report. (Exhibits A and B) The credit report shows all his accounts are in good \nstanding as follows: (1) a reported balance of $4,544 for four credit-card accounts, three \nof which have $0 balances; (2) a reported balance of $0 for no collection accounts; (3) a \nreported balance of $52,030 for 12 student loans (the two Salle Mae loans, which are \nnot at issue, and 10 loans with the Department of Education/Nelnet; the latter total \nabout $27,876; (4) a reported balance of $0 for auto loans; and (5) a reported balance \nof $356,059 for a mortgage loan for a recent purchase of a home. The three student \nloans with Navient are not reflected in this credit report, and they may have aged off. All \nten student loans with the Department of Education/Nelnet are in good standing as are \nthe two Salle Mae loans. \nIn addition to the credit report, Applicant presented a January 18, 2022 letter \nfrom the Department of Education concerning his student loans. (Exhibit C) The letter is \nverification that his loans were transferred to a new loan servicer (likely Nelnet) due to \nApplicant\u2019s rehabilitation of the loans. The letter also informed Applicant that the \nDepartment of Education had notified the national credit bureaus to delete the record of \ndefault from his credit record, and that he was eligible for all the benefits associated with \nthe rehabilitated loans before default. \nIn his post-hearing documentation, Applicant presented proof of payment on the \nthree charged-off student loans with Navient. (Exhibit H) It shows Applicant made 11 \npayments during 2020 for an account ending in 5368, which resulted in paying off the \ncharged-off account mentioned above. He made 10 payments during 2020-2021 for an \naccount ending in 1574. And he made 10 payments during 2020-2021 for an account \nending in 9508. Altogether, the payment history shows Applicant paid a total of $8,735, \nwith $5,214 applied to principal, $3,268 applied to interest, and $252 applied to fees. \nThe outstanding balance on the two unpaid charged-off loans is $62,751, which is \nconsistent with the $60,336 balance reflected in the July 2021 credit report discussed \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabove.

Recalling the January 2022 credit report, it shows all of \nApplicant\u2019s financial accounts are in good standing and that he has no collection \naccounts or public records. (Exhibits A and B) Applicant qualified for and obtained a \nmortgage loan to purchase his first home in December 2020.

(Exhibit E) Recent leave and \nearnings statements show he earned a gross income of about $101,241 in 2021. \n(Exhibit F) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nThe disqualifying conditions noted above apply. \n5  ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n6  Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concern stemming from his history of \ndelinquent student loans under AG \u00b6 20(d). As found in the findings of fact, the five \nfederal student loan accounts in collection were successfully rehabilitated and are now \nin good standing. (Exhibits 2, A, B, and C) Concerning the three charged-off accounts \nwith Navient, one account was repaid and the other two accounts are in repayment. \n(Exhibits 2 and H) Together, this shows Applicant is no longer neglecting his student \nloans and is taking the matter seriously. There is also ample evidence to show Applicant \nis conducting his financial affairs responsibly. The most recent credit report from \nJanuary 2022 shows all his accounts are in good standing and he has no collection \naccounts or public records. (Exhibits A and B). His finances were of sufficient quality to \nallow him to qualify for a mortgage loan of more than $350,000 to purchase his first \nhome in late 2020. (Exhibit D) He demonstrated common sense and good judgment \nwhen he bought a used 2017 Honda for cash as opposed to financing an expensive \nnew automobile with a huge monthly loan payment. (Exhibit G) He is earning a good \nincome and it appears he has sufficient cash flow to meet his financial obligations. \n(Exhibits E and F) Although he did not present a perfect case in mitigation, Applicant \nhas made a measurable good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent student loan \naccounts per AG \u00b6 20(d). \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indetedness. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of these apply. Applicant has failed to show that she has addressed or is \naddressing any of her past-due indebtedness. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She has not met her burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations, to include state \nand Federal income taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has addressed his delinquent state and Federal income taxes, and filed \nall the required tax returns. He has also addressed his debts to the remaining two \ncreditors through payment plans. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na fairly distinguished history of working in the defense industry. (AppXs E and F.) He \nperforms well at his job. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He \ndenied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i through 1.t. \nApplicant is 50 years old. He is a high school graduate. He has been married to \nhis second wife since 2009. They have a daughter. He has a son from his first marriage. \nHe enlisted in the Air Force in March 1993, and he was honorably discharged in March \n1997. While in the Air Force, he held a security clearance and did not have any infractions. \nHe then joined the Air Force Reserve. He said he could not complete his enlistment \ncontract because of his civilian job commitments. He was separated from the Reserve \nwith an other than honorable discharge in 1998. (GE 2). He has worked for defense \ncontractors since 2017 and his current employer since April 2021. (Tr. 17-22, 50; GE 1) \nIn May 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In it, he \ndisclosed that he failed to pay Federal and state income taxes for years 2013, 2014, and \n2015 because he did not have enough money. He said he had requested the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) and his state to withhold his refunds to satisfy the debts. (GE 1 at \n36). \nIn November 2019, Applicant answered the Government\u2019s interrogatories. He \nacknowledged that he had not paid a charged-off automobile loan for $9,896, an \nautomobile repossession with a balance of $6,741, a $1,624 cell phone debt, and a cable \nbox debt of $242. (GE 2) None of these debts are resolved, as noted below. \nApplicant testified that his financial problems began in 2015 when he moved to \nanother state, and then moved again a year or two later for employment. He said he \nmoved a couple times over the past 13 years, which resulted in additional expenses. (Tr. \n54-56) After his divorce from his first wife in 2007, he was required to pay child support, \nwhich at times strained his finances because his second wife was not always working. \n(Tr. 23) \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from June 2017 and March 2020, \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SCA, and his financial interrogatories, the SOR alleged 20 \nfinancial security concerns, which included eight Federal and state tax issues. (GE 4). His \ntax liability for unpaid Federal and state income taxes totaled $19,564. The 12 alleged \ndelinquent consumer debts totaled $21,540, and became delinquent between 2011 and \n2017. The SOR alleged a total of $41,104 in outstanding debt. (GE 3, 5, 6, and 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged Applicant failed to file his 2013 Federal income tax return.

The state filed three liens against Applicant \nin 2016, totaling $8,081. All outstanding taxes have been paid.

He started making payments on his Federal \ntaxes in 2018. (GE 2) He said he completed payments on his 2013 and 2014 Federal tax \ndebt, and continues to make payments on his 2015 tax debt. He thinks he still owes the \nIRS about $5,200. His tax refunds have been withheld by the IRS to reduce the debt. \nBetween 2018 and 2022, he has made 52 payments on three years of unpaid taxes. (Tr. \n24-25, 30, 58; AE D) These taxes are being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged an $85 utility debt went into collection in 2018. Applicant has not \nresolved this debt, but said he intended to look into the matter and pay it post-hearing. \n(Tr. 35) It is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged a $1,625 cell phone debt went into collection in 2017. Applicant \nhas not resolved this debt. (Tr. 36-37) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleged a $459 credit card debt was in collection. Applicant said he paid \nit last year, while applying for a mortgage to buy his house. He agreed to submit proof of \npayment post-hearing. (Tr. 36-37; AE H) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleged a $173 debt was owed to an energy company. It was charged \noff and paid on October 5, 2022. (Tr. 37-36; AE I) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleged an automobile loan was charged off for $9,896 in December \n2016. Applicant lost his job and could not make his payments. The account was opened \nin July 2013. He asked the creditor to add the unpaid amount owed to the balance of the \nloan, and told them he would catch up when he obtained a position. The creditor refused \nto do that. Applicant acknowledged that he still owes this debt. (Tr. 38\u201340) This debt \nappears on his February and September 2022 CBRs. (GE 6 and 7) It is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleged an automobile loan was reported as a repossession in May \n2017 with a delinquent balance of $6,741. Applicant opened the loan in late 2016, after \nhe lost the car listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j. Applicant purchased this car at an automobile \ndealership through their in-house financing department. He drove it for six months and \nmade weekly payments of $45 during that time. When he obtained a position in another \nstate, the creditor would not allow him to take the car out of state.

He said he paid this debt in 2016, but does not have a \nreceipt from his former employer because the shop closed. The June 2017 CBR notes \nthat the account was closed by the creditor. It does not appear on subsequent credit \nreports. (Tr. 43-44; GE 3, GE 4, GE 6) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q alleged a $495 debt owed to a cell phone company.

(Tr. 48) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following three potentially apply in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts, \nand unfiled and unpaid Federal and State taxes. The evidence establishes the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following five are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has seven old debts that total $19,543 and remain unresolved. There is \ninsufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). There is evidence that \nsome debts are attributable to a number of geographical moves he made for employment, \nand possibly the result of his divorce and support payments. There is insufficient evidence \nto establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) because he did not demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly under those circumstances. There is no evidence that he participated in credit \ncounseling; however, there is evidence that his financial problems are slowly coming \nunder control, due to some efforts to resolve them. He resolved five delinquent debts that \ntotal $1,997: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t. He also resolved his state tax problems \nand paid a portion of his unpaid Federal taxes. He established some mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) as to all tax-related \nallegations: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. He filed his Federal income \ntax returns for 2013 and 2014, and his state income tax returns for 2013 and 2014. He \npaid and resolved three state liens. In 2018, he entered into a repayment plan with the \nIRS to resolve his 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxes. Since then, he resolved his 2013 and 2014 \ndelinquent Federal taxes and he continues to resolve the remaining 2015 delinquent \nFederal taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n    \n       \n                       \n     \n               \n             \n               \n             \n                \n           \n                                  \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is 50 years old and served in the Air Force for about five years. In May \n2017, he applied for a security clearance, and in his SCA he disclosed delinquent Federal \nand state tax issues. In March 2018, he began addressing his 2013, 2014 and 2015 tax \nissues. In his November 2019 interrogatories, he reported that he had not resolved two \nautomobile loans, a cell phone debt, and a cable box debt. Subsequently, those debts, \nand others, were alleged in the June 2021 SOR. Those four old debts remain \nunaddressed, despite having notice of the Government\u2019s concerns since 2019 and again \nin 2021 when he received the SOR. He has made good progress in resolving his taxes, \nhowever, he continues to owe about $5,200 to the IRS for 2015, and he has not \naddressed $19,500 of delinquent debt. While Applicant does not need to be debt free for \npurposes of obtaining a security clearance, he is required to demonstrate responsible and \nreliable financial management. He has not sufficiently done that at this time. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nfully mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \n       Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:   \n         Subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i:     \n Subparagraphs 1.j through 1.l:     \n Subparagraphs 1.m through 1.p:  \n   Subparagraph 1.q:       \n For Applicant \n   Against Applicant \n         For Applicant \n    Against Applicant \n   For Applicant \n  Against Applicant \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n              Subparagraphs 1:r through 1.t:                       \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________ \n For Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. military or in the military reserve from 1989 until he retired with an \nhonorable discharge in 2008. He has about 90 college credits. He is married with three \nadult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16-17, 20-21; GE 1) \nApplicant served in war zones while on active duty. He has a 100% disability \nrating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for posttraumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and a heart condition. He receives about $3,915 per \nmonth in disability pay.

(Tr. at 18, 28-29, 39; GE 1-5) The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling \nabout $20,900. The debts consist of $6,265 and $4,377 owed on two military exchange \ncharged-off credit cards; three medical debts totaling $4,839; a charged-off auto loan of \n$5,043; and three miscellaneous delinquent debts ranging from $27 to $259 for a total \nof $375. Applicant admitted that he owed all of the debts at one time, but he stated that \nat least two of the debts were paid. \nApplicant stated that he stopped paying the two military exchange credit cards \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c) in about 2009. That is consistent with what is listed on the July \n2018 combined credit report. He entered into a payment agreement for the two \naccounts in April 2021. He agreed to pay $3,700 in May 2021, followed by 22 monthly \npayments of $500. He made a $3,700 payment in May 2021, and $500 payments in \nJune, July, and August 2021. He stopped making the payments when he was laid off in \nSeptember 2021. (Tr. at 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6; AE A, B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $5,045 charged-off auto loan. The July 2018 combined \ncredit report lists it as a joint account opened in 2012. Applicant stated that he cosigned \nthe loan for his son who was supposed to make the payments, but failed to do so. It is \nunclear when the vehicle was repossessed, but Applicant stated that he thought it was \nin about 2016 or 2017.

(Tr. at 19, 30-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJune 2018. He failed to report his financial problems under any question, including \nquestions that asked if in the last seven years, he had any possessions or property \nvoluntarily or involuntarily repossessed (this section not alleged); if he defaulted on any \ntype of loan (not alleged); if had bills or debts turned over to a collection company; if he \nhad any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed; if he had been over 120 days delinquent on any debt; and if he was currently \nover 120 delinquent on any debt. (GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in March 2019. He \ndiscussed the debts from the July 2018 credit report.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He stated \nthat he knew that he had two repossessed vehicles and he owed debts, but he was \nunsure why he answered the way he did. He stated that the information that he provided \nwas to the best of his knowledge, but it could have been related to his PTSD and bipolar \ndisorder. \nThe two military exchange credit cards may have become delinquent outside the \nseven-year window of the questions. There is some question as to whether Applicant \nknew that he had the three medical debts and the three small miscellaneous debts. I am \nunable to find that Applicant intentionally falsified the SF 86 by failing to report any of \nthese debts. \nApplicant was aware that he or his cosigner son stopped paying the two auto \nloans and both vehicles were repossessed within the seven-year window. Having \nconsidered all of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, education, experience, \nmedical conditions, and testimony, I find that he intentionally provided false testimony \non the SF 86 when he failed to report that he defaulted on the two auto loans; that he \nhad two vehicles voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed; that he had been over 120 \ndays delinquent on the two vehicle loans; and that he was currently over 120 delinquent \non the two vehicle loans. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR did not allege the question about repossessions. It also did not allege \nanything about the second defaulted auto loan and repossession, likely because it was \nunknown to the DOD until the 2021 credit report. Because those questions were not \nalleged, Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to report them cannot be used to establish a \ndisqualifying condition. It was alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to report that he \nhad been over 120 days delinquent on the first auto loan, and that he was currently over \n120 delinquent on that loan. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to those questions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant discussed the debts from the July 2018 credit report during his \nbackground investigation in March 2019, but there is no indication that he ever brought \nthe second repossessed vehicle to the investigator\u2019s attention. Additionally, Applicant \ndenied that he lied on the SF 86. Having determined that he intentionally omitted \ninformation about his finances in an attempt to mislead the government, I have also \ndetermined that his explanations that the omissions were unintentional were also false. \nIt would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.2 \n2  See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes multiple delinquent debts, is sufficient \nto raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his PTSD, bipolar disorder, and \nperiods of unemployment and underemployment after leaving the military. He paid the \n$89 telecommunications debt on March 30, 2021, the day after he received the SOR. \nHis assertions that he paid the $27 public utility debt and disputed the $259 insurance \ndebt are accepted. Those debts and the medical debts are mitigated. \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement for the two military exchange credit \ncards in April 2021, after he received the SOR. He is credited with paying $5,200 toward \nthose debts. He stopped making the $500 payments when he was laid off. He did \nnothing to pay the two auto loans. The facts that he only started paying the debts after \nhe received the SOR and never discussed the second auto loan until specifically asked \nabout it at the hearing, leave me with doubts that he would have paid his debts if not for \nhis security clearance. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after \nhaving been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nyears of honorable military service, including his deployments to war zones. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is an American \ncitizen by birth and comes from a long-line of American citizens. He noted his parents are \nproud Americans that taught him about the privileges of being an American citizen, and \nthe importance of the rights that we enjoy as American citizens. (Tr. 30) He grew up and \nwas educated in the United States, graduating from college with a double major in 2001. \nAfter college, he held a couple of jobs that allowed him to display his \nprofessionalism, skills, and knowledge. A federal contractor hired Applicant in 2007, and \nhe held a position of trust for 10 years. (Tr. 34) A large federal contractor hired him in \n2017, and it is currently sponsoring his security clearance. His current income is $165,000 \na year. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s cohabitant is a dual citizen of Russia and the \nUnited States who previously held a government job in Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that his \nin-laws (father, mother, and sister) are citizens and residents of Russia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, \nand 2.d). He admitted all of the foreign influence allegations with explanations. \nApplicant met his cohabitant and domestic partner (DP) in 2011. She was born in \nRussia to Russian parents in 1984. She grew up and was educated in Russia, graduating\nfrom college in 2005. (Tr. 126) She met her first husband, an American working with a\nU.S. agency in Moscow, in 2004. They married, and she became pregnant. She entered\nthe United States in 2008 while pregnant so that her daughter could be born in the United\nStates. She received her green card in 2009, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\n2011. (Tr. 79) Her ex-husband filed for divorce in 2011, which was finalized in 2016. (Tr.\n131)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his DP started a romantic relationship in January 2012. Since then, \nhe has been providing financial support for her and her child. Applicant and his father \nvisited Russia in June 2012, where they met and stayed with her Russian immediate \nfamily during their two-week visit. He has traveled with her to Russia almost every year, \nincluding 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019. They stayed with her family for about a \nmonth on each visit. The purpose of their visits is for his DP to visit with her family and \nfriends. (Tr. 71) \nApplicant and his DP are friends with a couple from Kazakhstan who were \nassigned to Kazakhstan\u2019s embassy in the United States. During their visit to Russia in \n2016, they travelled to Kazakhstan to visit with their friends who were in their country at \nthe time.

In 2016, they entered into a domestic partnership because he wanted to provide \nmedical insurance to his DP and her daughter. She receives child support from her ex-\nhusband, performs some modeling work, and is developing a small business from their \nhome. Applicant noted that she is very independent and takes pride in being able to \nprovide for herself. He feels that they are in a committed relationship. They have children \ntogether, and he intends to continue their relationship like a husband and wife. (Tr. 82) \nApplicant and his DP have three children, ages 14, 7, and 6; all of them were born \nin the United States. The oldest is Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter who was born of a prior \nmarriage of his DP with an American. He and his DP have no interest in their children \nhaving dual citizenship with Russia or having a Russian passport. She is teaching the \nchildren to speak Russian, and they travel to Russia with Applicant and his DP. She has \ntutors for her children to help them learn the Russian language. (Tr. 47, 118)  \nApplicant\u2019s DP has three savings accounts and a checking account in a Russian \nbank, and she owns some shares on a Russian bank that she purchased as an \ninvestment in 2020. Some of these accounts the DP has held since she began working \nin Russia. Others she opened to facilitate her transferring money to her family when \nneeded or to pay expenses during their visits to Russia. She uses her bank accounts to \npay her children\u2019s tutors in Russia. \nApplicant and his DP denied having any financial or property interest in Russia. He \nalso denied providing financial assistance to his DP\u2019s relatives in Russia, other than \nbuying food and giving small presents during their visits. (Tr. 43) He considers the current \npolitical regime in Russia to be extremely disturbing and disappointing. (Tr. 44) He \nbelieves he was naive about Russia when he first started visiting. He was not aware of \nthe levels of violence, intimidation, and the lack of protection of human rights that any \nperson, and especially the citizens, have to endure. He believes Russia is an extremely \ncorrupt country, almost like a large organized crime organization where even the judicial \nsystem is corrupt. (Tr. 44) \nApplicant noted that his DP was the first person that brought to his attention that \njournalists are routinely threatened, beaten, and murdered in Russia, and that citizens \ncannot count on having any rights. He agrees with the evidence admitted at his hearing \nidentifying Russia as a hostile country. Russian people who express dissent to be \nthreatened, beaten, jailed and murdered. Russia is engaging in an aggressive war in \nUkraine in which many civilians have died. (Tr. 46, 53, 143) \nThe DP possesses a U.S. passport and a valid Russian passport. She exclusively \nuses her Russian passport to travel to Russia. She has considered renouncing her \nRussian citizenship, but she is concerned the Russian government may interfere with her \nability to travel to Russia. Visiting her Russian family is very important to her, and she \ndoes not want to risk her ability to do so. She is concerned about having to request visas \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand not being assured of her right to travel and to be with her family. Her grandmother is \n92 years old, and her parents are aging. The DP has a very close-knit, loving, and caring \nrelationship with her Russian family. (Tr. 72) The DP speaks with her mother and her \nsister daily through the telephone or messaging applications, and she has a close \nrelationship with her father. They speak or communicate with each other at least once a \nweek. (Tr. 73) She asked her family to immigrate to the United States, but his \ngrandmother is too old and her parents are not interested in leaving their relatives in \nRussia. Russia refuses to honor United States citizenship for any Russian citizens. (Tr. \n48, 137) \nThe Russia government paid for the DP\u2019s education. She graduated with a \nbusiness administration degree. Applicant believes that she has never worked in any \ncapacity for the Russian Federation or the Russian government. She worked for a Middle \nEastern country embassy in Moscow in 2005 in an administrative position. From October \n2005 to June of 2009, she worked for foreign industry business developing firm in Moscow \nas a secretary to the assistant to the head of the representative of that office. (Tr. 75 - 77) \nThe DP is afraid to travel to Russia. She testified she has been quite vocal on \nsocial media against the Russian government and against the war in Ukraine. She also \nprotested in the United States in front of a Russian embassy when an opposition leader \nwas imprisoned. (Tr. 158 \u2013 159) She is worried that she will be arrested when she travels \nto Russia again. She currently does not feel safe about travelling to Russia. (Tr. 137) She \ntestified that for the last 16 years, she has been decrying the political situation in Russia, \nthe numerous human rights violations, the imprisonments and assassinations of \njournalists, opposition leaders, and political activists. She does not see herself ever \nwanting to or agreeing to cooperate with or assist the Russian government in any way for \nany reason, including possible pressure on my family members. (Tr. 148 - 149) \nThe DP\u2019s parents are citizen and residents of Russia. Her mother graduated from \na Russian university in 1986. (Tr. 87) Between 1986 and 1987, she worked for an all-\nRussian scientific research institute of Ukraine lands. (Tr. 87) She receives a Russian \ngovernment pension of 8,755.00 rubles a year (about $250 a month), that started in 2012.  \n(Tr. 90, 165) She frequently visited the United States to help the DP with her first child. \nBoth of her parents understand English well, and her mother can speak it at the same \nlevel that Applicant can speak Russian. He met his mother-in-law in 2012 when she \nvisited his DP in the US. She visited for six months between August 2014 and February \n2015, and stayed with her boyfriend in another state. (Tr. 170) She also visited Applicant \nand his family from March 2015 to June 2015, from September 2015 to March 2016, in \n2017 for about three months, and in 2019 for about five months (Tr. 96 - 99) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law served in the Soviet army from 1979 to 1981, and was \ntransferred to the reserve.

(AE O \u2013 S) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DP was born and educated in Russia. She is a dual citizen of Russia \nand the United States; however, Russia does not recognize her U.S. citizenship. Her \nparents, sister, grandmother, and extended family are residents and citizens of Russia. \nShe has close ties of affection and obligation to her Russian family as demonstrated by \nher daily communication with her mother and sister, and frequent communication with her \nfather and grandmother, and her frequent visits to her Russian family. Since 2011, she \nhas travelled to Russia to visit her family every year, except for 2009 and 2018; she last \ntravelled to Russia in 2019. \nThe DP has several bank accounts in Russia and has used them to facilitate travel \nto Russia, to financially assist her family when needed, and to pay for expenses in Russia. \nApplicant and their children travel with her to Russia. He has traveled with his DP and the \nchildren to Russia almost every year since 2012, including 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and \n2019. She has considered renouncing her Russian citizenship, but she is concerned the \nRussian government may interfere with her ability to travel to Russia. Visiting her Russian \nfamily is very important to her and she does not wish to risk her ability to do so. \nThe DP has been quite vocal on social media against the Russian government and \nagainst the war in Ukraine. She also protested in the United States in front of a Russian \nembassy when an opposition leader was imprisoned. She is afraid to travel to Russia and \nworried that she will be arrested when she travels to Russia. She does not feel safe to \ntravel to Russia. For the last 16 years, she has been decrying the political situation in \nRussia, the numerous human rights violations, the imprisonments and assassinations of \njournalists, opposition leaders, and political activists. She does not see herself ever \nwanting to or agreeing to cooperate with or assist the Russian government in any way for \nany reason, including possible pressure on her family members. \nApplicant has been providing financial support for his DP and her child since 2012. \nHe is committed to their relationship, they have three children together, and he equates \nhis relationship with her to being married. Applicant and his DP have no interest in their \nchildren having dual citizenship with Russia or having a Russian passport. He denied \nhaving any financial or property interest in Russia. He also denied providing direct \nfinancial assistance to his DP\u2019s relatives in Russia. He considers the current political \nregime in Russia to be \u201cextremely disturbing and disappointing\u201d. He is aware of the levels \nof violence, intimidation, and the lack of protection of human rights that any person, and \nespecially the Russian citizens, have to endure. He believes Russia is an extremely \ncorrupt country, almost like a large organized crime organization where even the judicial \nsystem is corrupt. He agrees that Russia is hostile to the United States. The unjustified \nRussian invasion of Ukraine has caused numerous civilian deaths. \nThe potential for terrorism, crime, and other violence against U.S. interests and \ncitizens remains high in Russia, and it continues to have human rights problems. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive information from \nany person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless \nof whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Russia. Applicant has extensive \nphysical and verbal contact with his DP and her parents, sister, grandmother, and \nextended family. He has visited Russia almost every year since 2012, except for 2009 \nand 2018. He has not visited Russia since 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his DP and her Russian family create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion that it is not outweighed by \nhis deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States. Russia is \nhostile to the United States and is engaging in a war against Ukraine. It utilizes aggressive \nespionage practices against the United States, and abuses its own citizens. It is likely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited States and the interests of his DP or her family in Russia. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. I find the Guideline B security concerns against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence+ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. He has worked well for federal contractors since \n2008. His resume, character letter references, awards, and his performance appraisal \nestablish his excellent performance, diligence, trustworthiness, professionalism, and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. He received numerous awards from his \nemployer. He is an outstanding employee and citizen. He expressed his undivided \nallegiance to the United States. He credibly testified that he would do nothing to \ncompromise the safety of the United States or the future of his children in the United \nStates. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. In particular, I considered Russia\u2019s \naggressive use of its intelligence services against the United States, its invasion of other \ncountry, and its documented human rights abuses against its people. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nforeign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n9 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The SOR also alleged that one of his four brothers serves as a colonel in the Kurdish Forces in Iraq (SOR 1.d), and that another brother works for Iraqi Transportation Security Agency (ITSA) at an airport in northern Iraq (SOR 1.e). Applicant admitted with explanations all of the SOR allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old, single, and works as an electronics testing technician in a non-defense industry job. He is one of eight children (five boys, three girls), all of whom were born and raised in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) of northern Iraq. He attended an 2 Iraqi university where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic engineering in 1989. After a U.S.-led coalition defeated Iraq in the first Gulf War in 1991, Kurdish militias staged an uprising against the regime of Saddam Hussein. The uprising was brutally repressed by Iraqi forces. At that time, Applicant was serving a mandatory enlistment in the Iraqi army as required under the Hussein regime. Rather than participate in the Iraqi suppression of Kurdish forces, Applicant deserted from the Iraqi army and returned to Kurdistan at the outset of the uprising.

The SOR alleged facts that raise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case is \ngoverned by Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. On \nJune 30, 2022, I convened a hearing using a video conferencing platform. The parties \nappeared as scheduled. Applicant testified but did not present any documentary \nevidence. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 12, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 7. GX 1 \u2013 6 are \nsubstantive exhibits in support of the Government\u2019s case, all of which were admitted \nwithout objection. GX 7 is the Government\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about Iraq. After giving Applicant an opportunity to comment on the \ninformation presented therein, I granted the Government\u2019s request and have included GX \n7 in the record. I have considered that information as appropriate. (Tr. 28) \nAfter the hearing, I held the record open so that Applicant could produce additional \nrelevant information. He timely provided documents I have identified as Applicant Exhibits \n(AX) A and B. AX A consists of copies of 13 letters or memoranda of recommendation or \ncommendation from various senior U.S. military officers; copies of three certificates of \nappreciation from U.S. military units; and photocopies of 12 \u201cchallenge coins\u201d from \ndifferent U.S. military units. The contents of AX A were issued to Applicant between \nAugust 2004 and January 2011. AX B is a copy of a vaccination certification, dated June \n30, 2022, attesting to Applicant\u2019s status as being fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The \nrecord closed on June 30, 2022, when Department Counsel waived objection to AX A \nand B. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR 1.a), father (SOR 1.b), four \nbrothers (SOR 1.c), and three sisters (SOR 1.f) are citizens and residents of Iraq. The \nSOR also alleged that one of his four brothers serves as a colonel in the Kurdish Forces \nin Iraq (SOR 1.d), and that another brother works for Iraqi Transportation Security Agency \n(ITSA) at an airport in northern Iraq (SOR 1.e). Applicant admitted with explanations all \nof the SOR allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old, single, and works as an electronics testing technician in \na non-defense industry job. He is one of eight children (five boys, three girls), all of whom \nwere born and raised in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) of northern Iraq.

The uprising was brutally repressed \nby Iraqi forces. At that time, Applicant was serving a mandatory enlistment in the Iraqi \narmy as required under the Hussein regime. Rather than participate in the Iraqi \nsuppression of Kurdish forces, Applicant deserted from the Iraqi army and returned to \nKurdistan at the outset of the uprising. After the subsequent establishment of a no-fly \nzone during NATO\u2019s Operation Northern Watch, he worked for one of several non-\ngovernmental organizations (NGO) that went to Iraq to build housing and provide shelter \nfor Kurds and other ethnic minorities displaced by the uprising. However, between 1994 \nand 1997, civil war broke out among the Kurds. Military responses by the Iraqi army, as \nwell as aggressions by Iranian-backed militia and terrorist organizations resulted in \nwidespread loss of life throughout the region. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 35 \u2013 39) \nIn March 1997, Applicant was evacuated from Kurdistan as part of an airlift of \nKurds who were at risk of harm from the Hussein regime because of their work with \nNGOs. As part of Operation Pacific Haven, he was transported via Turkey to the U.S. \nterritory of Guam. In December 1997, he was relocated to the continental United States \nand was granted refugee status. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2007. When \nApplicant was evacuated from the IKR, he was told he could bring his parents and those \nof his siblings who were younger than 21 years old. Rather than break up the family any \nfurther, Applicant\u2019s father decided that only Applicant would leave and the rest of the \nfamily would stay together. Applicant testified that he would like to have sponsored his \nsiblings to come to the United States after 2007, but he has mistakenly believed that they \nare still barred from emigrating from Iraq. Currently, his parents are too old and, in his \nfather\u2019s case, too frail to move. His siblings all have families and careers of their own, so \nhe now feels it does not make sense for them to move. Applicant also believes that the \nnorthern area of Iraq in which his family lives \u2013 Kurdistan \u2013 is stable and safe enough for \nthem to remain there. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; GX 6; Tr. 40 \u2013 42, 58 \u2013 59) \nIn March 2004, Applicant was hired by a U.S. defense contractor for work as a \nlinguist in support of U.S. military missions in Iraq following the 2003 U.S. invasion. He \nsubmitted an SF-85P application for a position of trust and his background was vetted by \nmilitary counterintelligence personnel before he could be assigned to work with those \nunits. For the next seven years, he worked closely with combat units assigned to a variety \nof missions in northern Iraq. He was not allowed to see his family when he was in Iraq, \nand he has always been aware of the risks involved should terrorist and other groups \nlearn of his work with the U.S. military. He understands that if he were to return to Iraq for \nwork in support of U.S. interests there, he again would not be able to visit his family there. \n(Answer; GX 2 \u2013 6; Tr. 43 \u2013 44, 61 \u2013 62, 66) \nBetween 2004 and 2011, Applicant established an excellent reputation as an \ninterpreter and cultural advisor as he assisted units at forward operating bases in regular \ncontact with the enemy. His work also required him to interact with senior U.S. and Iraqi \nofficials, assist in training of Iraqi security forces, and support U.S. and coalition efforts to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecure Iraq\u2019s borders with Turkey and Syria. Applicant often worked with units that came \nunder enemy fire, and on at least two occasions, he was with units that sustained attacks \nusing improvised explosive devices (IED). His work in support of U.S. interests was \nconsistently and effusively characterized as professional, dedicated, and trustworthy in \nall respects. The certificates of appreciation and his receipt of challenge coins from units \nwith whom he worked in combat zones reflect the appreciation of those commanders for \nApplicant\u2019s service. (GX 2 \u2013 6; AX A; Tr. 43 \u2013 46, 64 \u2013 66) \nInformation about Applicant\u2019s relatives in the IKR has not changed since he first \nstarted working as a linguist for the U.S. military in 2004. All of them still reside in the \nsame areas of northern Iraq which is governed by the Kurdistan Regional Government \n(KRG). One brother is a colonel in the Kurdish military forces, known as the Peshmerga, \nwith whom U.S. and coalition forces started operating after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in \n2003. Applicant thinks this brother will retire soon. Another brother works at an airport in \nthe IKR for the Iraqi equivalent of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA). Employees \nof that agency are trained by their U.S. counterparts and the airport is considered a high-\nvalue target of terrorists. His two other brothers are teachers at a university in northern \nIraq. Applicant\u2019s sister is a doctor in a hospital in northern Iraq; another is a teacher at a \nhigh school in northern Iraq; and the third is a stay-at-home mother who also cares for \ntheir parents. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; GX 6; GX 7; 33 \u2013 35, 48 \u2013 55) \nApplicant speaks as often as he can with his parents because he is concerned for \ntheir health. His contact with his other siblings is less frequent, occurring by phone or \nemail a few times each year. He has traveled back to Iraq and Kurdistan on several \noccasions to visit his parents since 2011. Applicant visited his parents in early 2022 \nbecause his father has been ill and he had been unable to visit for almost three years \nduring the pandemic. When he visits, he stays with his parents and with his sister who \nlives with and cares for them. While there, he also visits with his siblings if they are \navailable. He testified that after his parents die, he would have no interest in returning to \nIraq. (Answer; GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 48 \u2013 50, 56 \u2013 57) \nApplicant has lived in the same place in the United States since arriving from Guam \nalmost 25 years ago. After working in support of U.S. interests in Iraq for long stretches \nbetween 2004 and 2011, Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s contract ended and he returned \npermanently to the United States. Thereafter, he lived off his savings until January 2012, \nwhen he found employment in the electronics field. In June 2013, he purchased a home \nhere, and all of his financial and property interests have always been in the United States \nas long as he has lived here. (GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 46 \u2013 47) \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq as \npresented in GX 7. Additionally, much of the factual information presented in GX 1 \u2013 6, \nAX A, and Applicant\u2019s Answer and testimony make clear that Applicant\u2019s family ties are \nlocated in the largely autonomous Kurdistan province of Iraq. Therefore, I sua sponte \nhave taken notice of information about that region and its relationship with the central \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment of Iraq that is available on the U.S. Department of State website \n(https://www.state.gov). \nAs to Iraq in general, of particular note is the continued inability of its freely-elected \ngovernment to quell the violence and instability that persist in some parts of that country. \nThese conditions are fueled and perpetrated by terrorist groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda \nand ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. As a result, \nsome parts of Iraq, mainly in areas south of Baghdad, such as Basrah, remain wholly \nunstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject to random acts of terrorist violence. U.S. \ncitizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. The \nU.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The ability of the \nU.S. Embassy to provide consular services at the U.S. consulate in Basrah is extremely \nlimited given the security environment, while the U.S. embassy in the IKR capital of Erbil \nremains open. While ISIS insurgent groups remain active in Iraq, their control over large \nswaths of Iraq has been diminished by U.S. and coalition efforts. Such groups regularly \nattack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also \nthreaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. U.S. Government and \nwestern interests remain possible targets for attacks.  \nAdditionally, there are significant human-rights problems in Iraq. Widespread \ncorruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of violence by \nterrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi central government and its \njudiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and are \nnot being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting \ncivilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest \nand lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, \nfreedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal \nabuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for \nsignificant human rights abuses in Iraq. \nAs witnessed during the repression of Kurds by Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in the \nlate 1980s and early 1990s, the people of the IKR and the KRG itself have long been at \nodds with the Iraqi government. The KRG is largely autonomous and has established \nsome measure of stability. The KRG employs the Peshmerga, in concert with U.S. military \nunits, as its self-defense force against terrorist groups from Syria and (by proxy) Iran, as \nwell as against aggressions from Turkey intended to counter what that government views \nas Kurdish terrorist activities. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in response to \ninstabilities wrought by the Syrian civil war, U.S. and coalition forces have maintained a \nsignificant presence in Kurdistan, working with Peshmerga and other elements to control \nthe influx of ISIS and like-minded entities from both Syria and Turkey. One observation \nby the State Department tends to support Applicant\u2019s claim that Kurdistan is relatively \nsafer and more stable than the rest of Iraq; that is, that religious persecution and acts of \nviolence are more prevalent in areas of Iraq outside the IKR, and the KRG does not \nenforce Iraqi laws enacted by the central Iraqi government aimed at prosecuting the \npractice of religions other than those recognized by the central government.

(GX 7, Item II; https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-report-on-international-\nreligious-freedom/iraq/) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; see also AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has close ties to citizens of Iraq residing \nin Iraq. It also shows that he continues to be in contact with those persons, both \nelectronically and in person. Overall, the political and military situation in Iraq continues \nto present a heightened risk that his relatives may be pressured or coerced by groups \nhostile to U.S. interests as a means of compromising Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability \nto protect sensitive U.S. information. The disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) applies: \ncontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAdditionally, because two of Applicant\u2019s brothers work for the KRG through the \nPeshmerga and the Iraqi TSA, the record supports application of AG \u00b6 7(b): \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe record does not support application of AG \u00b6 8(c). Applicant\u2019s ties in Iraq, a \ncountry that presents a heightened risk of coercion, are familial and presumed to be close. \nAvailable information in support of that presumption includes frequent contact with and \nvisits to his elderly parents in the IKR. Before and after the pandemic, he has traveled to \nIraq to see them as often as possible, and he sees his siblings during those visits. He \ncommunicates with his siblings electronically a few times each year. He likely will not \nreturn to Iraq for family visits after his parents die, but that is a speculative consideration \nand not based on his current circumstances. \nAs to AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b), all of Applicant\u2019s property, financial, and employment \ninterests have been solely in the United States since he arrived here as a refugee in 1997. \nAlthough he did not present information about any ties to the community where he lives \n(e.g., participation in civic groups, religious activities, etc.), between 2004 and 2011, he \nestablished an impressive track record of protecting U.S. interests as a valuable member \nof U.S. military missions in Iraq and the IKR. Some of Applicant\u2019s work in those seven \nyears placed him at great risk of bodily harm, and he was uniformly praised by U.S. \nmilitary and other government officials for his support of and commitment to U.S. missions \nin Iraq. This information indicates a deep loyalty to the United States and creates a \nreasonable expectation that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. Further, the information about Applicant\u2019s ties to persons in Iraq since he \nwas first vetted for work as a linguist in 2004 does not appear to have changed. One must \nassume that Applicant again would work in the IKR but under circumstances on the \nground that are, while still risky, generally more stable than in 2011. To that end, he again \nwould be unable to visit his family, a restriction with which he complied during his previous \nwork in Iraq. I conclude that application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) is supported by this record. \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s past work with the U.S. military was noteworthy, not only for the quality \nof his performance, but because of the active combat risks in which he often found \nhimself. Given those circumstances, the letters of commendation and support from senior \nmilitary and civilian officials carry significant weight in determining whether Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshould again be entrusted with access to sensitive information. Today, conditions in Iraq \nand the IKR, while still dangerous, are more stable than in 2011. Information about \nApplicant\u2019s family is unchanged since it was vetted by U.S. counterintelligence personnel \nin 2004. I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. The record \nevidence as a whole supports a fair and commonsense decision in favor of the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have \naccess to classified information.

Applicant \nreceived the Government\u2019s FORM on January 4, 2021. He did not respond to the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2021. The \nGovernment\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 47 years old, \nunmarried, and has two minor children. As of his April 2019 security clearance \napplication (SCA), he owned a home since 2010. (Items 2, 3, 6) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1993. He earned an associate degree in \n2002 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. He served in the U.S. military from 1996 to 1999 \nand 2005 to 2009, and was honorably discharged on both occasions. He was \nunemployed from July 2009 to February 2010. He then worked for a previous DOD \ncontractor from March 2010 to September 2015, when he was laid off after a contract \nconcluded. He was unemployed until March 2016. He began working as a systems \nengineer for his employer, another DOD contractor, as of the date of his 2019 SCA. He \nwas first granted a security clearance in 2005. (Items 3, 6) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax year 2014, as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b). It also alleged that he has ten \ndelinquent consumer debts totaling $73,386 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.l). In his Answer, Applicant \ndenied all of the SOR debts. He claimed, without providing any corroborating \ndocuments, that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j is an error and has never existed; the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.h; and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l was a billing error \nincorrectly sent to a collection agency and has been resolved. He disclosed and \ndiscussed his failure to file his 2014 federal and state income tax returns and his \ndelinquent indebtedness to multiple creditors in the amount of approximately $60,000 \non his 2019 SCA and during his 2019 background interview. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to \n1.j are listed on his 2019 and 2020 credit bureau reports, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l is \nlisted on his 2019 credit bureau report. Both credit reports establish that the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant attributed his failure to file his 2014 federal and state income tax \nreturns and his delinquent debts to a six-month period of unemployment beginning in \nSeptember 2015, the unplanned birth of his child in 2016, \u201canother child on the way\u201d as \nof his background interview, and associated child-care expenses. Although he received \nstate unemployment benefits during this period of unemployment, it was \u201cjust enough to \npay for basic necessities.\u201d (Items 2, 3, 6) \nApplicant stated during his background interview that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l are credit cards, and the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.j are \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloans.

He failed to provide \ncorroborating documentation. He further stated during his background interview that his \ncurrent financial status \u201csucks,\u201d and he was unable to repay his debts because he had \nanother child on the way and would then have two children requiring daycare. He \nconsidered filing bankruptcy. He had not received any financial counseling or engaged \nany debt consolidation services. (Item 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Exec.

Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f) \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required\u201d apply. Applicant failed to file his 2014 federal and state \nincome tax return, and he was unable to pay his consumer debts. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe credit reports corroborate Applicant\u2019s claim that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k is a \nduplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. AG \u00b6 20(e) is established as to SOR \u00b6 1.k, and I find \nSOR \u00b6 1.k in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he \nacted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant has not demonstrated that he has \ntaken any steps toward filing his 2014 federal and state income tax return. He did not \nprovide sufficient proof of any efforts he made to resolve his remaining delinquent \nconsumer debts. He has not received any financial counseling. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j, 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The SOR recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated July 23, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on November 19, 2020. However, because of \nvarious health-related protocols associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, processing \nstopped until new hearing procedures could be established. The case was finally \nassigned to me on October 25, 2021. A Notice of Microsoft TEAMS Video Teleconference \nHearing was issued on March 3, 2022, scheduling the hearing for March 10, 2022.

In March 2021, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) granted him a 70% \nservice-connected disability rating. (AE A) He was granted a secret clearance in 1995, \nand again in March 2018. He was married in 1997 and divorced in 1999. He remarried in \n2006. He has no biological children. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nOn May 14, 2018, Applicant underwent a non-observed pre-employment \nurinalysis. He reported to his director of human resources (HR) that was feeling under the \nweather and noted that the urinalysis collection worker had left his urine \u201csitting out for \ntoo long\u201d \u2013 estimated to be approximately 30 minutes \u2013 resulting in a test result that was \noutside the normal range, requiring a re-test. (Tr. at 35, 46-47) He requested permission \nto undergo the re-test at another facility, and his request was granted, but he decided to \nreturn to the original testing facility. That same day, the urinalysis collection worker \nreported to HR that the urine sample was \u201cso far out of the normal range that [Applicant] \nwould\u2019ve \u2018been dead\u2019 for the urine to belong to him\u201d She implied the urine was far too cold \nfor the sample to have come from him.\u201d The re-test would have to be observed. (GE 5 at \n1; GE 6 (Email from HR, dated May 25, 2018)) \nAlthough an Incident History indicated that Applicant took an observed retest \nurinalysis the following day the actual Rapid Drug Screen Test Results state that the \nobserved urinalysis re-test occurred on May 18, 2018. (GE 9 at 5-6) The re-test certified \nresults were positive for marijuana metabolites of 296-ng/mL, exceeding the workplace \ndrug testing guideline of 50-ng/mL (confirmatory cutoff of 15-ng/mL). (GE 9 at 6) \nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana is a Schedule I Controlled Substance \n(https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (c)) On May 24, 2018, \nthe re-test results were reported to his employer, and Applicant disclosed to his supervisor \nthat the positive test was because he had \u201cbeen around individuals using marijuana in the \ntime prior to his drug tests.\u201d His employment was terminated. (GE 5 at 1) \nIn March or April 2018, Applicant was not sure when, although his wife claims it \nwas the last weekend in April 2018, he and his wife were on a camping trip at a park. He, \nhis wife, and another couple went to a party at someone else\u2019s camper in the park. They \nremained outside until it started to rain, and then they entered the camper. It was \ndescribed as a small one bedroom/one bath camper, or a 19 to 20-foot camper of about \n100 square feet, with no open windows. Applicant did not know any of the other people \nat the party. When they first arrived at the party-camper, Applicant could smell marijuana \nbeing smoked, essentially because he had used marijuana one time two and one-half \ndecades earlier while in high school. (Tr. at 70) One of his friends noted that three or four \npeople were smoking marijuana, and the smoke was heavy as he could see smoke \nlingering when he walked in. Nevertheless, in an exercise of bad judgment, Applicant \nremained at the party for about an hour and one-half and he consumed six or more beers \nand three or four mixed drinks, becoming slightly intoxicated. Applicant\u2019s wife thought he \nhad consumed two to possibly three Jell-O shots. He did not describe the mixed drinks. \nHe claimed that he did not use marijuana at the party or at any other time after high \nschool. He claimed he did not realize that marijuana being smoked by others in the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ncamper could get into his system. (GE 3 at 33-34; GE 4 at 4-5; AE Z; Statement of \nApplicant\u2019s wife, undated, attached to his Answer to SOR at 1; Tr. at 81-83, 90) \nApplicant\u2019s initial reaction was that since he was \u201cexposed\u201d to marijuana smoke at \nthe party \u201cinside a small camper,\u201d it must have been secondhand smoke from those \nmarijuana-smokers around him that he ingested. (Answer to SOR at 1) In December \n2019, well after that camper-party, he was informed by a female friend he has known for \nover two decades and his wife has known for three decades, that at the mid-April 2018 \ncamper-party, Jell-O shots with Cannabidiol (CBD) oil in them had purportedly been \nserved. (Statement dated July 17, 2020, attached to Answer to SOR) She overheard a \nconversation between some people she doesn\u2019t really know talking about the Jell-O \nshots. She, herself consumed seven Jell-O shots at the camper-party, but didn\u2019t feel any \ndifferent. (Tr. at 93-104) The husband of that woman consumed four or five shot-glass \nJell-O shots, and subsequently told Applicant that when he departed the party, he \noverheard a couple of women discussing how Jell-O shots are made, and one of them \nsaid that she made them with CBD oil. (AE Z) It was not made clear if that was merely a \nconversation in general, or if the CBD shots at the party were made with CBD oil. \nApplicant and his wife are now not sure if his problems occurred because of inhaling \nsecond-hand marijuana smoke or because he ingested CBD-infused Jell-O shots. \n(Statement of Applicant\u2019s wife at 2; Answer to SOR at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s position raises three separate areas of consideration: a) can an \nindividual test positive after inhaling secondhand marijuana smoke, and if so, what are \nthe parameters in play; b) can an individual test positive after consuming CBD, and if so, \nwhat are the parameters in play; and c) how long after an individual inhales secondhand \nmarijuana smoke, or consumes CBD, can the individual realistically test positive? \nTesting positive on a drug test after inhaling secondhand marijuana smoke: \nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) published a study where researchers \nconducted several experiments in which nonsmokers were placed in an unvented (all \nwindows and doors are closed) room or well-ventilated space very close to smokers \ncasually smoking marijuana. In one study, nonsmokers spent three hours in a well-\nventilated space. Sensitive laboratory tests were able to find THC in the nonsmokers\u2019 \nurine, but not enough to trigger a positive result on most commonly used drug tests. In \nanother experiment, nonsmokers spent one hour in an unventilated room with marijuana \nthat had higher levels of THC (11.3%, compared with 5.3% in the previous experiment). \nThis time, some nonsmoking participants did test positive for the THC in their urine \u2013 but \nit was rare, and it only happened in the hours right after the experiment. (emphasis \nsupplied) (GE 7) Based on the scientific evidence, I conclude that secondhand smoke \nwould not have registered a positive test result 19 days after the incident supposedly took \nplace. \nTesting positive on a drug test after consuming CBD-infused Jell-O shots: \nTo reach the 50ng/mL of THC, one would have to consume upwards of 2,000 mg \nof CBD products that contain 0.3% or less of THC, which is much higher than the average \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson is likely to take. Even in clinical trials and research studies, people are usually \nonly administered 100-800 mg per day. THC is fat-soluble, especially via edibles or a drop \nof oil on the tongue, and it is absorbed along with other fats and can be stored in the \nbody\u2019s fatty tissue. Depending on how much CBD is consumed, especially if it contains \nmore than 0.3% THC, how often it is consumed, an individual\u2019s body weight and diet, it is \npossible for THC to accumulate in the body in as little as four to six days to trigger a \npositive drug test. Research has found that THC can be detectable in one\u2019s system for \nup to 30 days, but it is usually only present in heavy cannabis users after the first \nweek. (AE Q) In urine testing, THC at a concentration of 50nL is necessary to trigger a \npositive test. (GE 8) Because detection windows vary according to dose and frequency \nof use, in general, THC metabolites are detectable in urine for approximately 3 to 15 days, \nand sometimes up to 30 days, after use. Also, since CBD is generally believed to have \nan elimination half-life of one to two days, half of the dose leaves the body at this time. \n(AE W) According to the Mayo Clinic, THC metabolites can be detected for as long as \n15 days post-administration among frequent and daily users. (emphasis supplied) \n(AE P; AE X) Based on the scientific evidence, I conclude that CBD would not have \nregistered a positive test result 19 days after the incident supposedly took place, unless \nApplicant was a frequent or daily user. \nThe date of the camper-party is seemingly in dispute, with Applicant contending \nthat it took place in March or April 2018 \u2013 he was unsure of the actual date; while his wife \nthought it took place during the last weekend in April, and her friend, and her friend\u2019s \nhusband claimed that it occurred in late April 2018. I have taken administrative notice that \nthe last weekend in April 2018 consisted of April 27th  (a Friday) through April 29th  (a \nSunday). What is not in dispute are the dates of the first unobserved urinalysis (May 14, \n2018) and the observed re-test (May 18, 2018) \u2013 19 days following the latest date \nconsidered the date of the camper-party. The first test was deemed unacceptable and \nwas rejected because the urine sample was \u201cso far out of the normal range that [Applicant] \nwould\u2019ve \u2018been dead\u2019 for the urine to belong to him,\u201d and it was implied the urine was far \ntoo cold for the sample to have come from Applicant.  The re-test results, as noted above, \nwere positive for marijuana metabolites of 296-ng/mL, exceeding the workplace drug \ntesting guideline of 50-ng/mL (confirmatory cutoff of 15-ng/mL), and as noted by \nDepartment Counsel, nearly six times the minimum required for a positive result.  \nApplicant also raised the issue regarding Applicant\u2019s weight during the camper \nincident. He was 44 years old at the time and supposedly weighed much more than he \ndoes today. Applicant\u2019s counsel noted that he weighed \u201cover 265 pounds\u201d at that time. \nHowever, that argument is seemingly without basis because Applicant reported in April \n2007 he weighed 220 pounds (2007 SF 86 at 6), and in December 2017 (2017 SF 86 at \n8), and again in July 2019 (2019 SF 86 at 8), when Applicant reported that he still weighed \n240 pounds. \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s future intentions, he submitted a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n(AE D) There is no evidence of Applicant ever having received drug-counseling or \ntreatment. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his 2019 SF 86, in response to several of the questions \nin Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled \nSubstances: In the last seven (7) years: (1) have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances; (2) provide the identity of the drug or controlled substance; (3) provide an \nestimate of the month and year of the most recent use; and (4) was your use while \npossessing a security clearance? Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the first and fourth \nquestions; identified the drug or controlled substance as marijuana; and \u201cestimated\u201d the \nmost recent use took place in March 2018. He explained that he was exposed to \nmarijuana at a party. (2019 SF 86 at 33-34) The SOR allegation was that Applicant \nfalsified material facts by claiming that his claimed most recent use occurred in March \n2018, whereas in truth, he used marijuana prior to his drug screenings in May 2018. \nBased on the evidence, and the way the SOR allegation was drafted, I conclude that with \nthe exception of the estimated date of most recent use, Applicant did not intentionally \nfalsify his response. It is clear that the incident took place in either March or April 2018, \nprior to the May 2018 drug screenings. \nIn November 2019, during an interview conducted by an investigator with the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant contended that he was exposed to \nmarijuana in March 2018 while attending the camper party described above. He claimed \nthat he was exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke while at the party, and that he did \nnot did not use marijuana at the party. (GE 4 at 7) The SOR allegation was that Applicant \nfalsified material facts to the investigator by denying that he had used marijuana prior to \nhis drug screenings in May 2018. Based on the evidence, and the way the SOR allegation \nwas drafted, I conclude that with the exception of the estimated date of most recent use, \nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his response, as alleged in the SOR. It is clear that \nthe incident took place in either March or April 2018, prior to the May 2018 drug \nscreenings. \nCharacter References and Work Performance \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s former supervisors, one the president of one his previous \nemployers, and the other the personnel and administration manager of another employer, \nare very supportive of him. Applicant\u2019s work ethic, logistical prowess, and communication \nskills were considered exceptional. He was always confident and knowledgeable and was \nrecognized as one who could break down a complex problem and be counted on to \ndevelop a viable solution set in a schedule-driven environment. (AE B; AE C) Another \nindividual in Applicant\u2019s former supervisory chain \u2013 for about five years \u2013 characterized \nhim as outstanding, being the first to arrive in the morning and available to stay late if \nneeded. Based on his knowledge of Applicant, he cannot believe the allegations or that \nhe would jeopardize himself by smoking marijuana. (Tr. at 114-116) Another team \nmember, while working alongside each other, but for different employers, never \nquestioned Applicant\u2019s honesty or integrity. (Tr. at 120-122) \nIn February 2009, an Air Force major general, serving as director of test, noted \nthat Applicant\u2019s exceptional performance of duty while supporting the short notice stand-\nup of a newly formed initiative was instrumental to the development and fielding of certain \nsystems for the protection of our nation and our allies.

(AE R) During both his military career and civilian career, to date, he has \nreceived numerous certificates of appreciation and military decorations. (AE G; AE H; AE \nJ; AE K; AE L; AE R) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a \n0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d \nAccordingly, products labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than 0.3 \npercent THC continue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, and \ntherefore remain illegal to use under federal law and policy. . . . [T]here is a \nrisk that using these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high \nlevels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under agency-\n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministered employment or random drug testing programs. Should an \nindividual test positive, they will be subject to an investigation under specific \nguidelines established by their home agency. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in March 2018. He underwent an \nunobserved pre-employment urinalysis on May 14, 2018, but that test was deemed \nunacceptable and was rejected because the urine sample was \u201cso far out of the normal \nrange that Applicant would\u2019ve \u2018been dead\u2019 for the urine to belong to him, and it was implied \nthe urine was far too cold for the sample to have come from Applicant.  As a result of a \nre-test on May 17, 2018, Applicant tested positive for marijuana metabolites of 296-\nng/mL, exceeding the workplace drug testing guideline of 50-ng/mL (confirmatory cutoff \nof 15-ng/mL). AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) minimally apply. The date of the camper party is seemingly \nin dispute, with Applicant contending that it took place in March or April 2018 \u2013 he was \nunsure of the actual date; while his wife thought it took place during the last weekend in \nApril, and her friend, and her friend\u2019s husband claimed that it occurred in late April 2018. \nAs noted above, I have taken administrative notice that the last weekend in April 2018 \nconsisted of April 27th  (a Friday) through April 29th  (a Sunday). What is not in dispute are \nthe dates of the first unobserved urinalysis (May 14, 2018) and the observed re-test (May \n18, 2018) \u2013 19 days following the latest date considered the date of the camper-party. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhile he has acknowledged his \u201cexposure\u201d to marijuana, either through secondhand \nsmoke or by consuming CBD-infused Jell-O shots, and he denied any knowing use of \nmarijuana between the party-camper incident and the date of the initial drug test, he has \noffered no evidence other than possible scenarios and unproven suggestions of possible \nreasons for his positive re-test, the results of which were nearly six times the minimum \nrequired for a positive result. \nAside from the re-test results, the issues surrounding the initial rejected test create \nsubstantial doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s acknowledgement of his of actions involving drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. It will never be known, unless a DNA analysis is \nperformed on that test sample to see if the urine was Applicant\u2019s or it belonged to \nsomeone else. If it was not Applicant\u2019s urine, other issues arise regarding his \ntrustworthiness and honesty. Also, the four-day delay in taking the re-test creates \nadditional doubt if it was associated with an effort to reduce any possible THC still in his \nsystem. He has cut his ties with the camp site. He submitted a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nThere is no evidence of Applicant ever having received drug-counseling or treatment. All \nof the above continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b616: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b) and 16(e) have been established, but AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been \nestablished. Applicant was terminated from his employment in May 2018 after failing two \ndrug screenings. The initial sample was outside the normal temperature range and the \nre-test sample tested positive for THC. He had been granted a security clearance in \nMarch 2018. When Applicant completed his 2019 SF 86, in response to several of the \nquestions in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or \nControlled Substances: In the last seven (7) years: (1) have you illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances; (2) provide the identity of the drug or controlled substance; (3) \nprovide an estimate of the month and year of the most recent use; and (4) was your use \nwhile possessing a security clearance? Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the first and fourth \nquestions; identified the drug or controlled substance as marijuana; and \u201cestimated\u201d the \nmost recent use took place in March 2018. He explained that he was exposed to \nmarijuana at a party. The SOR allegation was that Applicant falsified material facts by \nclaiming that his claimed most recent use occurred in March 2018, whereas in truth, he \nused marijuana prior to his drug screenings in May 2018. Based on the evidence, and the \nway the SOR allegation was drafted, with the exception of the estimated date of most \nrecent use, Applicant did not intentionally falsify his response. It is clear that the incident \ntook place in either March or April 2018, prior to the May 2018 drug screenings. \nIn November 2019, during an OPM interview, Applicant contended that he was \nexposed to marijuana in March 2018 while attending the camper party described above. \nHe claimed that he was exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke while at the party, and \nthat he did not did not use marijuana at the party. The SOR allegation was that Applicant \nfalsified material facts to the investigator by denying that he had used marijuana prior to \nhis drug screenings in May 2018. Based on the evidence, and the way the SOR allegation \nwas drafted, with the exception of the estimated date of most recent use, Applicant did \nnot intentionally falsify his response, as alleged in the SOR. It is clear that the incident \ntook place in either March or April 2018, prior to the May 2018 drug screenings. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNone of the conditions apply. While time has passed since the 2018 camper-party, \nthe rejected initial drug screen, and the positive re-test, Applicant has been steadfast in \ndenying any knowing use of marijuana, and only acknowledged \u201cexposure\u201d to marijuana. \nFirst he attributed the positive re-test to secondhand smoke, and then he transitioned into \nCBD-infused Jell-O shots. His first urinalysis was rejected, and four days later his re-test \nwas positive, with a number nearly six times the minimum required for a positive result. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Applicant is a 49-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a property manager with his \ncurrent employer since about April 2021. He was previously employed by various \nemployers in a variety of positions, including senior supply specialist, inventory manager, \nsecurity specialist, warehouse manager, helpdesk lead, and cable installer and network \ntechnician. A 1992 high school graduate, he earned college credits but no degree. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in April 1995 and served on active duty until April 1999, \nwhen he was honorably discharged. He served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve until he was \nhonorably discharged as a senior airman (E-4) in May 2007. In March 2021, the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) granted him a 70% service-connected disability \nrating. (AE A) He was granted a secret clearance in 1995, and again in March 2018. \nFormer supervisors support him. Applicant\u2019s Enlisted Performance Reports covering the \nperiod \n1995 \nthrough \n1998 \nreflect \nprimarily \nexceptional \nperformance \nwith \nrecommendations that he be promoted immediately. During both his military career and \ncivilian career, to date, he has received numerous certificates of appreciation and military \ndecorations. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in March 2018. He underwent an unobserved \npre-employment urinalysis on May 14, 2018, but that test was deemed unacceptable and \nwas rejected because the urine sample was \u201cso far out of the normal range that Applicant \nwould\u2019ve \u2018been dead\u2019 for the urine to belong to him, and it was implied the urine was far \ntoo cold for the sample to have come from Applicant. As a result of a re-test on May 17, \n2018, Applicant tested positive for marijuana metabolites of 296-ng/mL, exceeding the \nworkplace drug testing guideline of 50-ng/mL (confirmatory cutoff of 15-ng/mL). That test \nresult was nearly six times the minimum required for a positive test result.  Based on the \nscientific evidence, neither secondhand smoke nor CBD would have registered a positive \ntest result 19 days after the incident supposedly took place, unless Applicant was a \nfrequent or daily user. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse, and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 25, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn August 3, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on October 23, \n2021. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence is identified as Items 3 through 5. Applicant submitted no response. There were \nno objections by Applicant, and all Items are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on February 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and subsequently \nattended technical school and community college. Applicant married in 1994, divorced in \n2013, reconciled and has cohabitated with his former spouse since 2014. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2018 and was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in January 2019. He disclosed a delinquent \ncredit card account (approximately $66,000). Applicant said he was unable to pay the \ndebt after his contract with a Federal agency ended in May 2015 because of \nunemployment and underemployment, and noted his ex-wife\u2019s spending habits \ncontributed to his financial difficulties and their divorce. He reported unemployment from \nMay 2015 to December 2015, and part-time employment from December 2015 until he \nsecured full-time employment in July 2016. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant stated he used the delinquent credit card to pay health insurance costs \nand, prior to losing his contractor position, made the minimum monthly payment required \nunder the card agreement. Applicant said he informed the creditor he lost his job and \nwould be unable to make monthly payments in May or June 2015, and reported an \naccount balance of approximately $55,000 at the time. He said subsequent efforts to \nsettle the account were unsuccessful because he could not afford to pay other monthly \nliving expenses and payments requested by the creditor at that time. Applicant reported \nthe creditor offered credit counseling as a term of an agreement that also required he pay \nat least two percent of the total balance each month, but that he did not attend credit \ncounseling because he was unable to make the required payments. He reports no \npayments on the account alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a., since June 2015, and credit records \nreflect no account activity since December 2015. (Items 3, 4, 5). \nDuring his January 2019 background interview, Applicant reported he had a good \njob with steady income, that his financial situation was good, that he paid his bills on time \nand had savings, but said he was unable to repay the delinquent credit card balance. He \nalso disclosed a second delinquent account ($16,000) with the same creditor, and opined \nthe loan account was likely not reflected in his credit report because it was beyond the \nstatute of limitations and no longer a valid debt. (Item 4) \nIn his August 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. He again attributed the delinquency to unemployment and \nunderemployment, and recounted unsuccessful efforts to reach a settlement agreement \nwith the creditor. He noted that after his financial situation improved and the account was \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharged off, he continued communications with the creditor in an effort to settle the debt, \nbut made no payments. He said legal experts advised him not to make any payments on \nthe account, because payment on the delinquent debt would extend the period during \nwhich the creditor would have legal recourse under state law. He admitted he had made \nno payments in five years, and stated his belief the statute of limitations barred the creditor \nfrom collecting the unsecured debt. He concluded by recounting his service to various \nU.S. Government entities, including work in Afghanistan. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. is not \nresolved. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant did not provide specific evidence of his current financial budget, savings \nor expendable income. Credit records submitted by the Government dated December \n2019 reflect only two active credit accounts, the account alleged in the SOR and another \ncredit card account with a then current balance of less than $100. (Item 5) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a single delinquent debt that began accumulating in 2015. He \ndisclosed the debt alleged in the SOR and efforts to settle the account in his 2018 SCA \nand 2019 background interview. Applicant admitted the debt was his in his answer to the \nSOR. He has provided no evidence of payment on the debt since 2015 or that the debt \nhas been resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant used the delinquent credit card account alleged in the SOR to pay health \ninsurance costs prior to losing his contracting position in May 2015. He admitted making \nonly minimum payments prior to that time on an estimated account balance of $55,000. \nHe provided no evidence of payment on the debt since 2015 or evidence the debt has \nbeen resolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to unemployment and underemployment, \nand attributes contemporaneous financial difficulties to his ex-wife\u2019s spending habits that \ncontributed to their divorce in 2013. His divorce, unemployment and underemployment \nfrom May 2015 to July 2016 were beyond his control. Applicant reported attempts to settle \nthe debt with the creditor from 2015 until at least January 2019, but did not provide \ndocumentary evidence of any action on his part to contact the creditor or proof of any \npayments to resolve the debt. His failure to make a single payment on this delinquent \ndebt once he had the ability to do so after securing fulltime employment in July 2016 was \nnot acting responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nApplicant has made no payments on the delinquent account since 2015, and \ndeclined to participate in financial counseling offered by the creditor. He reported being \nadvised by legal experts not to make a single payment on the delinquent account to avoid \nresetting the statute of limitations. Reliance upon a statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is of limited mitigation \nvalue. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). Although an applicant \nlegally may rely on the running of a statute of limitation to avoid paying a debt, such \nreliance does not, by itself, constitute a good-faith effort to resolve debts within the \nmeaning of the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered Applicant divorced in 2013 due in part to his ex-wife\u2019s spending habits, \nwas unemployed and underemployed from May 2015 to July 2016. I considered that there \nis no evidence of additional delinquent accounts since 2019. However, Applicant \naccumulated a large delinquent debt in the past that he refuses to pay. He has been \nsteadily employed since July 2016 and has refused to pay about $66,614 in delinquent \ndebt accumulated before becoming gainfully employed. There is no evidence or claim of \nany payment on the delinquent account since 2015, even though Applicant reports \nincome sufficient to pay other expenses and to make contributions to a savings account. \nAlthough his decision not to make any payments on this debt may have been a sound \nfinancial avenue for Applicant to follow to eventually put his finances in order and clear \nhis negative credit history, his decision also raises potentially disqualifying and current \nsecurity concerns under the Directive. The potential for recurrence is significant in light of \nApplicant\u2019s admission that he was also delinquent on a $16,000 loan from the same \ncreditor, a debt he described as no longer valid because it was beyond the statute of \nlimitations for collection. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant's eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric C. Price \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

On January \n26, 2013, he signed and certified that SF-86. On February 17, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline E. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nOn March 16, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested \na hearing.

The question instructed applicants to answer \u2018No\u2019 if the counseling was \nfor any of the following reasons and was not court-ordered: strictly marital, family, grief \nnot related to violence by applicant, or strictly related to adjustments from service in a \nmilitary combat environment. Applicant answered \u2018No\u2019 and is alleged to have deliberately \nfailed to disclose that he received mental health treatment from about 2001 to January \n2013. Applicant denied this allegation.

The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(d), as potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. This evidence shifts the burden to Appellant to establish \nmitigation. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating\nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

His explanation for \nanswering the questions as he did is reasonable. I found him to be precise in the way he \nanswered questions in general and the way he responded to the questions regarding \nconsulting with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health \nconclusion on his 2013 and 2015 SF-86s to be no different. \nWhen queried about his past emotional or mental health counseling during his \nOPM PSI, in his DOHA Interrogatories, and during his hearing, he was forthright and \nconsistent in his responses. He answered the mental health questions to the best of his \nability and I find there was no deliberate attempt on his part to deceive or mislead. There \nwas no Government evidence that rebutted Applicant\u2019s version regarding his completion \nof the mental health questions on his SF-86s. He also provided other adverse information \non his SF-86s such as being terminated from employment. I note that the mental health \nquestion Applicant answered in 2013 and 2015 was completely rewritten in 2016. In light \nof the foregoing, I find that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his SF-86s and find for \nhim with regard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nProblematic, when viewed in light of the totality of circumstances, are Applicant\u2019s \nthree terminations that occurred within a five-year period: (1) unsatisfactory performance \nin October 2012; (2) resigned in lieu of being terminated in January 2014; and (3) \nterminated for violating firm\u2019s workplace and sexual harassment policy in May 2017. \nThese terminations might suggest a greater problem. Applicant provided explanations for \neach of these terminations and his explanations remained consistent throughout this \nprocess. No documentary evidence was presented to rebut or substantially challenge \nApplicant\u2019s explanations. The most recent and most serious termination is Applicant\u2019s \nthird termination for violating the firm\u2019s workplace and sexual harassment policy. \nApplicant acknowledged that tapping a female coworker on the shoulder was perceived \nby her as sexual harassment. The Government\u2019s psychologist considered Applicant\u2019s \nworkplace behavior and concluded his mental health did not have a hearing on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or ability to protect classified information. Applicant continues \nto receive counseling for mild depression as well as for marriage enrichment and to \nmaintain a professional attitude in the workplace. \nAs of the hearing date, I note that the first termination is nine years old, the second \ntermination is seven years old, and the third termination is four years old. Sufficient time \nhas elapsed since these incidents and there have been no documented recurrences. The \nGovernment\u2019s psychologist found, \u201cClinical interview and the results of psychological \ntesting indicates that the [Applicant] is not currently experiencing any significant \npsychological symptoms which would disqualify him from being able to hold a security \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance.\u201d In addition, and perhaps most importantly, Applicant testified credibly to a \nbetter understanding of how his conduct might be perceived by others. He has also \nundergone appropriate counseling, in part to assist him in maintaining a professional \nattitude in the work place. \nIn light of the foregoing, Applicant produced sufficient evidence to warrant \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e). I find for Applicant with regard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b through 1.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline E are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old information assurance engineer who has been employed \nby a defense contractor since August 2021. He seeks to retain his Top Secret clearance, \nwhich is a requirement of his continued employment. He honorably served in the U.S. \nNavy and retired as a chief petty officer after serving 20 years. During those 20 years, he \nmade seven deployments and received various awards and decorations. After retiring \nfrom the Navy, he has been continuously employed as a defense contractor. In total, \nApplicant has successfully held a security clearance for 37 years. \nSince retiring from the Navy, Applicant has earned a Bachelor of Science degree \nand a Master\u2019s degree. He is the sole support for his disabled wife. He is also heavily \ninvolved in his local community with two dog rescue organizations. Applicant continues \nto participate in counseling to become a better spouse and employee and avoid the \nmistakes that may have haunted him in the past. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \ncontext of the whole person.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since March \n2003. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He is married and has two children, ages 13 and 8. \nHe has held a security clearance since 2004. (Tr. 6, 21-22; GE1, 4) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from 2007 to \nOctober 2017, while having access to classified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Under Guideline \nE, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his March 2013 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) when he failed to disclose his illegal drug use as \nstated in SOR \u00b6 1.a above. (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \nApplicant admitted all of his illegal drug use, and his deliberate false answers given \non his 2013 SCA. Applicant began using marijuana in high school and continued his use \nthrough his college years. He graduated from college in 2002. He was hired by his current \nemployer in 2003 and was investigated for and received a security clearance in 2004. He \nclaims he listed his previous high school and college drug use on his first SCA, however, \nthat document is not part of the record so it cannot corroborate his assertion. He also \nasserts that he stopped using marijuana from the time of his hiring (2003) until \napproximately 2007, when he began using marijuana again. He started using marijuana \nin 2007 on a recreational basis approximately two to five times a year. He used it with \ncollege friends and while on vacation with his friends. He remains friends with some of \nthe people with whom he smoked marijuana, and they continue to use marijuana in his \npresence. He claims they respect his decision not to use marijuana any longer. Applicant \nwas aware that marijuana use violated his company\u2019s drug policy and that using \nmarijuana was illegal in the state where he was using it. He now lives in a state where \nmarijuana use is legal under state law. His wife works for the same employer and also \nholds a security clearance. She did not and does not use marijuana and was unhappy \nabout Applicant\u2019s use of it. He continued to use marijuana until approximately October \n2017, when he stopped using it. He testified that there was no monumental event that led \nto his cessation of marijuana use. Shortly thereafter, he reported his marijuana use to his \nemployer. In April 2018, he received a letter of reprimand for violating the company\u2019s drug \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npolicy.

(Tr. 23, 26-33, 41-43; SOR \nAnswer; AE E-G) \nApplicant admitted that he knowingly falsified his 2013 SCA by not listing his \nmarijuana use. He claims he was embarrassed to disclose this information at the time \nand he knew his use of marijuana was wrong. He continued to use marijuana after \ncompleting this SCA. After his disclosure to his employer in 2017-2018, he completed an \nSCA in March of 2018 where he disclosed his previous marijuana use. (Tr. 31-33; GE 1, \n5) \n \nApplicant is involved in community activities such as coaching youth activities, \nhelping out at school activities, and serving as a substitute teacher. His volunteer work at \nhis children\u2019s school was commended by the school principal and assistant principal. \nApplicant was characterized as a valuable school asset and positive influence. He \nprovided letters of support from two work supervisors who describe Applicant as honest, \ntrustworthy, and very remorseful for his conduct that led to this point. They recommend \nhim for a position of trust. Applicant also provided letters of commendation where he was \nrecognized for his contributions to team successes. His work evaluations from 2003 to \n2020 characterize him as follows: satisfactory contributor (2003), h\n igh contributor (2004-\n2006), exceptional (2007-2011), 20% (2012), exceeded (2015, 2018), significantly \nexceeded (2013-2014, 2016-2017, 2019-2020). (Tr. 22-23; AE B-D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s use and possession of marijuana, between 2007 and 2017 is supported \nby his admissions and other evidence. He used marijuana after being granted a security \nclearance in 2004. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana 20 to 60 times between 2007 and 2017. Given his \npattern of use, his claimed abstinence beginning in 2017 is not sufficient to overcome his \nprolonged marijuana use. Although he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all future illegal drug use, he remains in contact with marijuana users who continue \nto use the substance in his presence. Applicant\u2019s claimed abstinence is insufficient to \nconvince me that recurrence is unlikely. The frequency and recency of his past use, and \nhis uses while holding a security clearance, and after he completed a second SCA in \n2013 cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) does not apply, but AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on his 2013 SCA \nbecause he knew his marijuana use was wrong. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he was granted a security clearance and his \nfailure to disclose his continued use of marijuana to his employer for over ten years \ncauses significant concern. He was well aware of his responsibilities to disclose his drug \nuse in 2013 when he completed his SCA, but he failed to do so because of personal \nconcerns. He did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous falsifications. \nDeliberately providing false information on a SCA is not a minor offense. It strikes at the \nheart of the security clearance investigation process. These actions raise questions about \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Although Applicant claims he will \nnot use illegal drugs in the future, he remains in contact with drug-using friends. Also, he \nhas not obtained counseling to help correct his aberrant behavior. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), \nand 17(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s work record, his \nletters of support, and his community involvement. However, I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of marijuana use and his continued use after obtaining a security clearance. He \nalso deliberately falsified his 2013 SCA in order to retain a security clearance. Applicant \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement and personal \nconduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has three alcohol-related criminal offenses. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has not had any arrests or charges since the 2018 arrest. He stated \nthat he drinks infrequently. When he does drink, it is responsibly, and he never drinks \nand drives. I believe Applicant may be on the right track. However, three incidents in \nabout five years cause me to have doubts, and AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d None of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to \novercome concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

The second to last sentence in SOR \u00b6 1.c reads, in \npart, as follows: \u201cHowever, you did admit . . . despite knowing she did [not] want you to \ncontact her.\u201d The word \"not\" is missing. While I conclude this is a clerical error, I also \nconclude that good cause is established to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c so that it conforms to the \nrecord evidence on a matter critical to the reading of the allegation. I do so, sua sponte, \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, amend the second to last sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.c so that \nit reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \nHowever, you did admit to the investigating police officer that you had sent \nyour former co-worker text messages despite knowing she did not want you \nto contact her. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c and denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, and 1.e.

He graduated from high \nschool in 2008 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting in 2014. He is unmarried \nand he does not have any children. (Answer; Tr. at 17-25; GE 1) \nApplicant worked for a previous DOD contractor (company A) from April 2015 until \nJune 2018. Since then and as of the date of the hearing, he worked as a data analyst for \nhis employer, also a DOD contractor (company B). He was first granted a security \nclearance in March 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 6, 17-26, 111-113; GE 1, 3, 7) \n2 \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant resigned from employment with company A in \nJune 2018, in lieu of being fired, after company A concluded that he engaged in repeated \nunwanted and unprofessional communication with a female co-worker (CW1), even after \ncompany A counseled him to cease communication, and that he is not eligible for rehire \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). The SOR also alleged that after Applicant\u2019s 2018 resignation in lieu of firing: \n(1) Applicant was seen in and around the exterior of company A\u2019s headquarters, where \nCW1 continued to work, on at least three occasions; he continued to engage in unwanted \ncommunication with CW1; and company A consequently sent him a notice to cease \ntrespassing on its property (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and (2) CW1 and CW1\u2019s spouse reported to the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his January 2019 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), in response to \u201cSection 13A - Employment \nActivities,\u201d \u201cReason for Leaving.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e). \nThe SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions; June 2018 \nemployment records from company A; an October 2018 adverse action report, submitted \nby company A to the Defense Security Service (DSS); a December 2018 Joint Personnel \nAdjudication System (JPAS) incident history report, submitted by company A to the DSS, \nconcerning an incident that occurred on June 5, 2018; Applicant\u2019s January 2019 SCA; a \nMarch 2019 police report concerning a suspicious event that occurred on June 13, 2018; \nreports of background interviews conducted in April and May 2019; and records of \nApplicant\u2019s communications to CW1 between approximately 2017 and 2019. (Answer; Tr. \nat 27-153; GE 1-8) \nApplicant and CW 1 became colleagues at company A when she was assigned, in \nmid to late 2017, to a project he was working on. Applicant testified that he considered \nher, over time, to be a \u201cgood friend,\u201d but he never pursued or had any other kind of \nrelationship with her. He acknowledged that in approximately late September 2017, she \nrequested, in response to a text he sent her, that he stop texting her. He continued to text \nher, from his personal cellular phone to hers, through January 2018; she never \nresponded. When CW1 contacted the police on June 13, 2018, as further discussed \nbelow, she reported that Applicant had been harassing her at work \u201cfor the past year.\u201d \n(Tr. at 27-52, 113-114; GE 1-7) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisors and senior human resources staff at company A \ninstructed him to cease his unwanted social contact with CW1. Applicant disregarded \ntheir instructions and continued his conduct. An October 2018 adverse action report, \nsubmitted by company A to the DSS, reflects that Applicant received such instruction over \nthe course of at least four counseling sessions. Applicant testified that he was only \ncounseled once by company A, in mid-January 2018.

The record further reflects that Applicant \u201cconfirmed his \nunderstanding of this expectation and agreed that he would not make any further contact.\u201d \nApplicant testified that other than in-person communications with CW1 regarding work, \u201cI \ndon\u2019t recall like a text, but I don\u2019t think I sent any texts after that meeting, that was non \nwork related.\u201d The record also contains an undated letter from Applicant to CW1 in which \nApplicant acknowledged a potential for his termination from company A if he continued \ncontacting CW1. He wrote, in part: \nI overlooked your wishes when I was emotionally drowning so I\u2019m going to \nignore it one more time and reach out to let you know that I cannot stand on \na side knowing that someone that I know is going through grief and I\u2019m not \nthere to help or support.

Applicant maintained that he \nvoluntarily resigned from employment with company A; he acknowledged that he did so \nwithout providing a two-week notice and that his managers did not inquire as to why he \nchose to voluntarily resign.

He testified both that: (1) he did not recall company A ever telling him he was \ngoing to be fired, and (2) company A never told him he was going to be fired. He testified \nthat at the time he left company A, he believed he was eligible for rehire as he was never \ngiven any paperwork stating otherwise. As such, Applicant maintained that he did not \nfalsify his responses to section 13A of his 2019 SCA. (Answer; Tr. at 53-80, 121-127, \n142-152; GE 1, 7, 8; AE B) \nAfter he was terminated by company A, Applicant continued to contact CW1 on \nnumerous occasions, via e-mails, text messages, and telephone calls, which she reported \nto the police. One email, dated June 12, 2018, contains, in part, the following subject line: \n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize friendship requires apologies. I have ask[ed] myself could I love someone \nthis much . . . ?\u201d CW1 and her spouse also reported to the police on June 13, 2018, that \nthey believed Applicant appeared in his car outside their residence; a police officer \nconfirmed that the license plate provided by CW1\u2019s spouse belonged to Applicant. \nApplicant denied, when questioned by the police and at hearing, that he had driven by \nCW1\u2019s residence, but he admitted that he had sent her unwanted text messages. He told \nthe police, \u201ceven though he knew [CW1] didn\u2019t want him to text[,] he didn\u2019t want [CW1] to \nthink he had abandoned her when he \u2018resigned.\u2019\u201d He testified and indicated during his \nApril 2019 background interview that he wanted closure from CW1 as to why she no \nlonger wanted contact, it was hard for him to grasp that he had lost a friend due to gossip, \nand he wanted to let her know that he did not hold any hard feelings towards her and was \nstill amenable to their friendship. The police issued him a trespass notice on June 13, \n2018, barring him from CW1\u2019s residence. (Tr. at 80-106, 127-152; GE 2-7) \nFollowing his employment separation from company A, Applicant was seen on at \nleast three occasions in and around the exterior of company A\u2019s headquarters, where \nCW1 continued to work, despite having no known need to be in the area of company A\u2019s \nheadquarters during normal business hours. He testified that he normally exercised in the \narea where company A is located, and his new employer was also located in the same \nvicinity. Company A sent him a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d letter via certified mail on June 18, 2018, \nnotifying him that he was banned from all of its state-wide properties, and company A \nfiled a copy of the letter with the police department in the county where its headquarters \nis located. Applicant acknowledged during his April 2019 background interview that \nbecause he was banned from company A\u2019s property, he was not eligible for rehire with \ncompany A. (Answer; Tr. at 80-106, 127-142; GE 7, 8) \nApplicant continued to contact CW1. He testified that he wanted to confirm whether \nit was her, and not company A, who filed the June 13, 2018 trespass notice, and he \nwanted to invite her to a housewarming party. He emailed her on July 30, 2018, with the \nsubject line, \u201cI challenge you.\u201d He emailed her twice in August 2018. He emailed her in \nOctober 2018, after finding out that she was working for another employer (company C), \nto inquire about company C\u2019s hiring event. He emailed her in November 2018, to notify \nher that he was running the same marathon he knew she was running. He emailed her in \nJanuary and February 2019. He testified that he last contacted CW1 when one of her \nfriends contacted him in around March 2019 and asked him to stop. His communications \nwith CW1 persisted even after she sent him this text in July 2018: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nI don\u2019t want to talk to you.

Although he testified \nthat \u201c. . . in terms of facing that situation, that probably will never happen again,\u201d he also \nstated, \u201c. . . at this point, I\u2019m kind of struggling on how to -- how to approach a situation \nlike that again . . . .\u201d He felt his intention of being a friend was misconstrued. A former \nsupervisor of Applicant from company A, for whom Applicant worked from around 2015 \nto 2017, stated that he did not have any direct, firsthand knowledge of the incidents \nreferenced in the SOR and had never witnessed Applicant engage in any illegal, \ninappropriate or unprofessional conduct. He described Applicant as a \u201csolid and \ndependable performer,\u201d and he did not have any concerns with Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness and ability to conduct himself professionally. Another individual from \ncompany A, who referred to Applicant as a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d in November 2017, wrote \nthat she knew Applicant for two years and described him as an \u201casset\u201d to the team. (Tr. \nat 25-27, 106-110; AE A, C). \nA managing director at company B, who referred to Applicant as a \u201cbusiness \nassociate\u201d in November 2020, wrote that she knew Applicant for three years and \ndescribed him as \u201chelpful,\u201d \u201creliable,\u201d and \u201cwell-respected.\u201d Another managing director at \ncompany B, who was Applicant\u2019s previous direct supervisor when Applicant started \nworking for company B and who has maintained \u201cfrequent\u201d contact with him, described \nApplicant as a \u201cpleasure to work with\u201d and an individual who has \u201cexcellent working \nrelationships with those at all levels at [company B].\u201d His \u201cimmediate manager\u201d as of \nNovember 2020 referred to Applicant as her \u201cmost trusted senior on the audit,\u201d and an \nindividual of \u201cexemplary character.\u201d Finally, a co-worker from company B wrote, in \nNovember 2020, that he had worked with Applicant for just over a year and she \nconsidered him to be a valuable resource to their team. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     . . .

This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; . . . . \nApplicant resigned from employment with company A in June 2018, in lieu of being \nfired, after company A concluded that he engaged in repeated unwanted and \nunprofessional communication with CW1, even after company A counseled him to cease \ncommunication. He is not eligible for rehire with company A. After his resignation in lieu \nof termination, Applicant was seen in and around the exterior of company A\u2019s \nheadquarters, where CW1 continued to work, on at least three occasions. He also \ncontinued to engage in unwanted communication with CW1. Company A consequently \nsent him a notice to cease trespassing on its property. In addition, CW1 and CW1\u2019s \nspouse reported to the police that they believed Applicant appeared outside their \nresidence. Although he denied it upon police questioning, he admitted that he had sent \nCW1 unwanted text messages, and the police consequently issued him a trespass notice. \nApplicant also falsified material facts on his January 2019 SCA when he deliberately failed \nto disclose that he voluntarily resigned from his employment with company A, in lieu of \nbeing fired, for the reasons previously discussed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(d)(2) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s underlying conduct that led to his resignation from company A, in lieu \nof being fired, occurred over three years ago, and he has, thus far, proven his \nprofessionalism at company B. However, both the record evidence and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony continue to raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. I did not find Applicant to be candid or credible at the hearing. His conduct \ntoward CW1 was inappropriate and continued after CW1 asked him to stop; after \ncompany A warned him that such continued conduct would result in his termination; and \nafter he resigned from company A in lieu of being fired. His testimony concerning such \nconduct was inconsistent and in contradiction of the record evidence, to include records \nof his communication with her. Applicant\u2019s testimony that he voluntarily resigned from \ncompany A, without providing a two-week notice, solely because of an unacceptable \nworkplace culture that stemmed from a misunderstood relationship between him and \nCW1, as well as his acceptance of company B\u2019s offer of employment, was also not \ncredible in light of the record evidence. Applicant\u2019s failure to truthfully disclose the nature \nof his termination from company A on his SCA weighs against any mitigation, \nrehabilitation, and favorable conclusions concerning his credibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), (b), (c), \nand 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 49 years old and is divorced with one child. He has a high school diploma and military training. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Maintenance Technician. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to twelve creditors totaling approximately $60,0000, for delinquent accounts that have either been placed for collection or charged off. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated May 10, 2018; May 14, 2019; and January 7, 2021, confirm the indebtedness.

Applicant submitted no response to the FORM. DOHA assigned \nthe case to me on August 9, 2022. Items 1 through 7 will hereinafter be referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 49 years old and is divorced with one child. He has a high school \ndiploma and military training. \nHe is employed by a defense contractor as a \nMaintenance Technician. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to twelve creditors totaling \napproximately $60,0000, for delinquent accounts that have either been placed for \ncollection or charged off. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated May 10, 2018; May 14, 2019; and January 7, 2021, \nconfirm the indebtedness. \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1992 to 1996, and received an honorable \ndischarge. \nHe then attended a University from 1996 to 2000, without receiving a \ndegree. He rejoined the military, this time serving in the Army on active duty from 2005 \nto 2016, and is now in the reserves. While in the Army, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance, and it was denied due to financial issues. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant \ngot married in 2010, and divorced in 2012. Since 2016, Applicant has lived with his \ngirlfriend, and they have one child born in 2014. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in March 2018. He applied for \na security clearance on May 1, 2018, and disclosed in his application that he has had \nnumerous delinquent accounts in the last seven years. (Government Exhibit 2.) During \nhis subject interview, as part of his background investigation, Applicant stated that he \nplanned to contact his creditors and set up payment plans. (Government Exhibit 3.) In \nhis interrogatories, he stated that he is working with the Veteran\u2019s Administration \nservices to set up debt counseling to get his finances in order. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nNo further information was or has been provided in this regard. \nApplicant attributes his financial delinquencies to multiple issues. His divorce in \n2012, relocation costs, limited funds available to support himself, and child support \ncommitments. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant failed to provide any documentary \nevidence to support his contentions or any actions taken to resolve his delinquent debts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a.

There is no evidence to show that Applicant has \ndone anything to resolve the debt. The debt remains owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts totaling approximately $60,000. These \naccounts have either been charged off or placed for collection. \nThe evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR. \nHe has failed to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation. He states that his divorce in \n2012, relocation costs, and child support commitments have contributed to his financial \ndifficulties, but provides nothing more. He gives no reasonable excuse for his excessive \nindebtedness, or why it still exists when his divorce was ten years ago. Furthermore, \nthe record indicates that this is not his first time being denied a security clearance for \nfinancial issues. Applicant has known for some time that his financial delinquencies and \nnumerous unpaid bills pose a threat to his security clearance eligibility, and he has done \nnothing to resolve the issue. \nHis debts remain delinquent and owing. \nApplicant \nexpresses a desire to resolve them, but has done nothing about it. Applicant\u2019s inaction \nfor so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nAccordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.l.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $50,656 for ten past-due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). The debts alleged at SOR 1.f \u2013 1.h are for unpaid medical bills. Also alleged are unpaid federal (SOR 1.i) and state (SOR 1.j) taxes for the 2016 tax year. The debt at SOR 1.a is for past-due child support payments, and SOR 1.c \u2013 1.c address delinquent credit card accounts. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation all of the Guideline F allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 51 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by his employer, a federal contractor, for whom he has worked since August 2005. He has held a security clearance since 2007. He was married between 2004 and 2013, when he was divorced. Applicant and his ex-wife have two children for whom he is obligated to pay $370 weekly in child support. According to an October 2018 credit report, Applicant owed $13,035 in past-due child support payments that had been referred for collection. A November 2019 credit report showed that delinquency had been reduced to $11,691 as alleged in SOR 1.a.

Based on the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) could not, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, \nand by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, make an affirmative \ndetermination that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for \nApplicant to continue to have access to classified information. \nOn June 30, 2020, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).

On February 18, 2022, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) containing eight exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 8) on which the \nGovernment relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant received the FORM on March 3, 2022, and was informed he had 30 days \nfrom receipt of the FORM to submit additional information. He did not submit anything \nfurther and the record closed on April 3, 2022. I received the case for decision on May \n13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $50,656 for ten past-due \nor delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). The debts alleged at SOR 1.f \u2013 1.h are for unpaid \nmedical bills. Also alleged are unpaid federal (SOR 1.i) and state (SOR 1.j) taxes for the \n2016 tax year. The debt at SOR 1.a is for past-due child support payments, and SOR 1.c \n\u2013 1.c address delinquent credit card accounts. In response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted with explanation all of the Guideline F allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by his employer, \na federal contractor, for whom he has worked since August 2005. He has held a security \nclearance since 2007. He was married between 2004 and 2013, when he was divorced. \nApplicant and his ex-wife have two children for whom he is obligated to pay $370 weekly \nin child support. According to an October 2018 credit report, Applicant owed $13,035 in \npast-due child support payments that had been referred for collection. A November 2019 \ncredit report showed that delinquency had been reduced to $11,691 as alleged in SOR \n1.a. In response to the SOR, Applicant averred he had reduced that obligation to $4,500 \nbut he did not provide any corroboration of that claim. (FORM, Items 2, 3, 6, and 7) \nIn his most recent e-QIP (FORM, Item 3), he disclosed several of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. All of the debts alleged in the SOR are further documented by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions thereto, and by the documents provided by Department Counsel with the \nFORM. (Items 2 \u2013 7) Applicant has asserted in response to SOR 1.b \u2013 1.h that he will pay \nthose debts after he has satisfied his child support delinquency. He also claimed that he \nhas paid the 2016 federal and state income tax debts. He did not provide any support for \nhis responses. (FORM, Item 2) \nApplicant asserted that his financial problems are the result of his 2013 divorce, a \nfailed business, unplanned house repairs, and excessive child support obligations. He \nalso cited medical costs stemming from an emergency room visit, surgery, and other \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical procedures and treatments as causes for his financial problems. He did not \nprovide any further detail about those circumstances or other information to support his \nclaims. \nAs to any financial counseling or other corrective measures, Applicant asserted in \nhis e-QIP that he was consulting an attorney and intended to file for bankruptcy protection \nto resolve his debts. Again, there is nothing in the record to support or expound on this \nclaim. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See ----\nEgan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows, despite the claims made in his Answer, that Applicant \nowes more than $50,000 for ten delinquent debts. It appears from this record that most, \nif not all, of the debts alleged remain unresolved. This information reasonably raises the \nsecurity concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Government\u2019s information presented a prima facie case for disqualification. \nAccordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. He did not do so. The \nrecord does not support any of the cited mitigating conditions. His debts are multiple and \nrecent, as it was not established they have been paid. While his divorce may qualify as a \ncircumstance beyond his control, Applicant did not establish that he has acted responsibly \nin the face of those circumstances. There is no information that supports his claims of \npayment or that shows when those payments may have been made. As for his tax debts, \nhe did not support his claims that those have been paid. In summary, Applicant did not \nmeet his burden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification \nfrom access to classified information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \npresents unresolved doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. His ongoing financial problems leave him at risk of engaging in unacceptable \nconduct to resolve his debts. Further, his apparent lack of action in addressing his \nfinancial problems reflects adversely on his judgment and reliability. Because protection \nof the national interest is the principal focus in these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved against allowing access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In May 2022, the case was settled \nfor $20,500; however, the medical bills have not been settled according to his lawyer\u2019s \nJuly 2022 email. (AE G) Applicant said some of the medical debts in the SOR relate to \nhis accident. (Tr. 38) During a September 2019 interview with an investigator, Applicant \nsaid his lawyer had advised him not to pay the medical bills until the case is settled. (GE \n2 at 5) \nA week prior to his accident, Applicant\u2019s wife had a stroke and was hospitalized for \na couple weeks. While recovering, she had a heart attack. At the time of her stroke, she \nhad been earning about $50,000 to $60,000 annually. Her medical condition prevented \nher from returning to work and she lost her position. For the first year after his accident \nand her stroke, both of them spent time in the hospital. She continued to be hospitalized \nperiodically for the next couple of years. (Tr. 39-43) His wife handled their finances prior \nto her hospitalization. After her stroke, he had to manage the bills and was late paying \nthem at times. (Tr. 39) The loss of her income and reduction in his income had a \ndevastating effect on their finances. (Tr. 43; GE 2 at 6) Applicant\u2019s wife finally returned to \nwork three or four months ago. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrior to his accident, Applicant paid one student loan for $22,112 in June 2015. \n(GE 3 at 6) Subsequently, in January 2018, he paid and settled three student loans, which \ntotaled $23,030. (Tr. 44-45; GE 2 at 4; AE E, AE F) \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from September 2019, February 2020, and \nJune 2022, the SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling about $41,905, which became \ndelinquent between 2015 and 2019. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) The status of each debt is as \nfollows: \n1. The alleged student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $19,367 and the student loan in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n for $17,659 were consolidated. According to the June 2022 CBR, the balance \nis $31,174. Applicant made monthly payments of $144 from August 2020 to June \n2022. He continues to make those payments. (Tr. 50, 53; GE 3 at 5; AE D; AE I-1 \nthrough I-33) They are being resolved. \n2. The $1,454 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a judgment for three credit \ncards owed to the same creditor. Applicant said he settled the judgment for $500 \nand paid it 2015 or 2016. He submitted two credit card statements from August and \nSeptember 2015, both of which show smaller amounts past due. Since receiving \nthe SOR, he called the creditor, who told him the account is closed. (Tr. 58-60; AE \nH-3 and H-4) There is insufficient evidence to conclude that it is resolved. \n3. The $389 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was paid post-hearing. It was a \nmedical debt from 2015. (AE H-1) It is resolved. \n4.

The $166 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was paid post-hearing. It was a \nmedical debt from 2015. (AE H-2) It is resolved. \n6. Nine SOR alleged medical debts are unresolved: \u00b6\u00b6 1.d for $213; 1.f for $140; 1.g \nfor $140; 1.h for $129; 1.i for $1,294; 1.j for 561; 1.k for $108; 1.l for $72; and 1.m \nfor $213. They were opened between 2015 and 2017. They total $2,870 and they \nwere reported as collection accounts in September 2019. Some or all of these debts \nmay be pending resolution through Applicant\u2019s personal injury lawsuit. Applicant \nthinks he may have paid some. (Tr. 68-69; GE at 5; AE G) \nApplicant has resolved or is resolving $37,581 of the $41,905 alleged debt. Nine \nmedical debts, totaling $2,870, may be related to his accident, and are yet to be resolved. \nThe $1,454 credit card debt is not resolved. He stated that if any of these reported debts \nwere found to be his, he would pay them. (Tr. 78) \nApplicant submitted his budget. His net monthly income is $6,868 and includes his \nwife\u2019s income. Their expenses total $2,585 and payments on debts, including a mortgage \nand student loans, are $3,205.

He denied that he intentionally failed to disclose that \ninformation or attempted to deceive the Government. \nDuring his September 2019 interview, Applicant said he misunderstood the \nfinancial questions. He told the investigator that he had recently learned of some student \nloans with which he was unfamiliar. He was disputing them because he paid them, but \nthey had switched creditors. In his March 2021 Answer to the SOR, Applicant again \ndenied that he intentionally attempted to deceive the Government about his finances. He \ntestified that he believed he had paid his debts and his accounts were current when he \nsubmitted his SCA. He said that he also had found debts on his credit report that were \nnot his. (Tr. 71-73; GE 2 at 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The \nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-\nperson concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and experienced financial problems, \nbeginning in 2015, some of which continue into the present. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt, which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts occurred under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Those circumstances entailed \nsignificant medical problems that both Applicant and his wife encountered in 2016, and \nwere clearly beyond his control. He managed to resolve some student loans in 2015 and \n2018. He has been making payments on two other student loans since 2020. His medical \ndebts accumulated between 2015 and 2019, some of which are related to his shoulder \ninjury. In 2018, he paid a student loan, indicating that he was attempting to manage his \nstudent loans. Some medical bills may be resolved through his personal injury lawsuit. \nThere is sufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant has not participated in budget or credit counseling, but there is sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial situation is under control, as demonstrated by his \nresolution of a large portion of the alleged debt. Applicant paid and resolved the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. He is resolving the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.n through a payment plan. The evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) \nand AG \u00b6 20(d). According to Applicant\u2019s lawyer, there is a reasonable basis for Applicant \nto delay payment of the nine alleged debts, as they may not be his legal responsibility. \nThe evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e). \nApplicant documented that he has made sufficient progress in resolving his debts. \nHe has a valid legal reason for not resolving nine medical debts at this time. He stated \nthat he would pay any outstanding debt that is found to be his responsibility. There is \nsatisfactory assurance that his financial problems are being responsibly resolved. Under \nall the circumstances, he established sufficient mitigation of financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant acknowledged that he did not disclose the delinquent debts alleged in \nthe August 2019 SCA, but denied that he deliberately omitted them with intent to deceive \nthe Government. He was confused by the questions and believed that he had paid or \nresolved his debts and student loans at the time he completed his SCA. After listening to \nhim testify and observing his demeanor, I find Applicant\u2019s explanations credible. \nBased on his denials, his confusion about the status of his student loans and \nmedical debts at the time he submitted his 2019 SCA, and his resolution of student loans \nin 2015 and 2018, the Government failed to prove by substantial evidence that Applicant \ndeliberately concealed information from the Government. He refuted the allegation under \nthis guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is a 48-year old \nveteran who honorably served in the Army for 15 or more years and has held a security \nclearance since then without incident. He has been continuously employed with the same \nemployer since 2010. He gave credible testimony. In 2016, he and his wife simultaneously \nsuffered serious health problems, which led to a significant decrease in their income. In \nspite of those hardships, Applicant has established a record of responsibly managing \ndebts as demonstrated by his actions. Within the last three months, his wife returned to \nwork, which is improving their finances. There is sufficient evidence to resolve my \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He mitigated the security \nconcerns raised under the financial considerations guideline. He refuted those raised \nunder the personal conduct guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.n:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 2.a: \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She was married from 2014 until her divorce was \nfinalized in July 2019, and she has no children. She graduated from college in 1995, and \nreceived a master\u2019s degree in 2018. Applicant has worked for her current employer since \nJuly 2001, and in February 2020, she was promoted to a senior level manager. (Items 1-\n4) \nApplicant started consuming alcohol when she was 16. In 2011, she underwent \ngastric bypass surgery. As a result of the surgery, her body processed alcohol differently, \nand she also started consuming it in larger quantities. In subsequent years, her unhappy \nmarriage and the stress of graduate school contributed to her desire to consume more \nalcohol. (Items 1-6) \nIn late 2015, Applicant was referred by her primary care physician to a psychiatrist \nspecializing in geriatric psychiatry and addiction medicine \u201cto determine if medication \ncould assist with this behavioral issue\u201d. Starting on December 16, 2015, Applicant met \nwith Dr. X weekly for 1 month. He diagnosed her with, Adjustment Disorder with Mixed \nAnxiety and Depressed Mood (Active); Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe (Active); and \nInsomnia Due to a Medical Condition (Active). Dr. X prescribed her with Revia and Vivitrol, \nwhich are used to prevent alcohol and drug relapses and Desyrel, an antidepressant. He \nrecommended that she attend 90 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings in 90 days and \nreferred her to a therapist. Their meetings decreased to monthly and then every six to \neight weeks. \nApplicant provided copies of the Dr. X\u2019s treatment records in response to DOHA\u2019s \ninterrogatory request. For periods of time between December 2015 and March 13, 2020 \n(the most recent record provided), she claimed to be sober, but was often combining \nalcohol with her alcohol-cessation medication. She drank as much as a box of wine at \nnight, and frequently she consumed two bottles of wine a night. Applicant continued to \nconsume alcohol against her physician\u2019s advice to cope with the stress of her job, \ngraduate school, and her unhappy marriage. She admitted to binge drinking due to stress; \nbinge drinking while on medication; binge drinking over the holidays; and an unwillingness \nto go to AA meetings. Additionally, it was noted that because she worked from home, \nprior to the COVID 19 pandemic, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption blended from day into \nevening; she sometimes drank in the morning; and she suffered from blackouts. (Item 6) \nWhile Applicant was being treated by Dr. X, her drinking escalated to the point that \nshe voluntarily sought inpatient treatment. At the time that she was admitted to Facility \nA\u2019s detox unit on June 24, 2017, she was consuming two bottles of wine nightly. She \nsought treatment, in part, because the medication she had been prescribed, including \ndouble doses of Antabuse, was not working. At Facility A she was initially diagnosed with \nAlcohol Dependence, and it was noted in her treatment records that her potential for \nrelapse was \u201cat a high risk without residential treatment for Addiction.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nUpon her discharge from Facility A on July 5, 2017, the treating health care \nprovider recommended that Applicant avoid alcohol and all addictive mood-altering drugs; \nmaintain abstinence; continued integration of 12-step recovery; and obtain a sponsor \nwithin two weeks of discharge. Additionally, she had a discharge intake appointment with \na psychologist and was enrolled in a continued connection program with a referral to AA. \nHer diagnosis at discharge was, in part, Alcohol Dependence with withdrawal, \nuncomplicated and Alcoholic liver disease, unspecified. (Item 5) \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant complied with Facility A\u2019s \ntreatment recommendations to attend AA meetings. She admitted to Dr. X on July 29, \n2017, at her appointment following her release from Facility A, that despite receiving \nsome follow-up psychological treatment upon leaving Facility A, she had relapsed and \nconsumed alcohol. Applicant\u2019s extensive treatment records from Dr. X indicate that she \ncontinued to consume alcohol up until March 13, 2020 (the most recent record provided) \ndespite his ongoing recommendation that she refrain from consumption, seek therapy, \nand attend AA meetings. As of March 13, 2020, Dr. X\u2019s diagnosis was, Persistent \nDepressive Disorder with intermittent major depressive depression (Active); Alcohol Use \nDisorder, Moderate (Active); and Insomnia Due to Medical Condition. (Items 5-6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s July 15, 2019 personal subject interview, she admitted that she \nwas continuing to consume six to eight cans of beer nightly, but she believed that once \nher divorce was finalized her alcohol consumption would decrease. In her April 20, 2020 \nresponse to DOHA\u2019s interrogatory request, she provided updated information regarding \nher consumption of alcohol. At that time, she was consuming six to seven 12 ounce cans \nof hard seltzers every night of the week, and she had last consumed alcohol the night \nbefore she completed her response. (Item 4) \nIn her December 2020 response to the SOR, Applicant asserted that her drinking \nhad improved after she started attending therapy in 2020. However, she provided no \nadditional details as to how frequently she attended therapy, nor did she provide an \nexplanation as to why she had not previously attended therapy, as recommended to her \nsince 2015. She did not provide supporting documentation from her therapist in her SOR \nresponse, nor did she provide a response to the FORM. Additionally, she admitted that \nthe longest period of sobriety that she was able to maintain was six weeks, but did not \nprovide details as to when this period occurred. She also claimed that she no longer drank \ndaily and described her drinking as a \u201chabit\u201d that she uses as a \u201cwind down period from \na busy day.\u201d (Items 1, 6) \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant described herself as \u201ca very highly \nfunctioning person\u201d and denied that her alcohol-related issues raised concerns regarding \nher reliability and trustworthiness. However, she did admit that she drinks \u201ctoo much, and \nit impacts [her] health and cognitive ability.\u201d She provided documentation related to her \nwork performance, reflecting that she is a valued employee who consistently exceeds \nexpectations in her performance ratings.

The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will \napply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the \nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.) \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdministrative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2 (a). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns raised \nunder this guideline. Three are potentially applicable: \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nestablished a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npatter \nof \nmodified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has been diagnosed multiple times with an alcohol-use disorder by duly \nqualified medical professionals. Despite receiving treatment from a psychiatrist since \nDecember 2015, and inpatient detox treatment in June and July 2017, she continues to \nconsume alcohol against multiple physicians\u2019 advice. \nIn her December 2020 response to the SOR, Applicant claimed that had she \nmodified her consumption of alcohol and was no longer consuming it on a daily basis, but \nfailed to provide documentary evidence to support her claim. Nor did she provide a \nresponse to the FORM. Due to a lack of substantiation to support her claims, Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy history of alcohol abuse has not been mitigated. \nApplicant provided evidence of treatment with Dr. X and at Facility A; however, the \nrecords also reflect relapses and minimal periods of sobriety. She self-admitted that her \nlongest period of abstinence was six weeks. Additionally, her treating physicians \nrecommended that she abstain from alcohol completely, and she has failed to follow these \nrecommendations. After consideration of the whole record, I conclude there is not \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns about her alcohol \nconsumption given her history of diagnoses, treatment, relapses, and continued \nconsumption of alcohol against treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), 23(c), and \n23(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable work history and performance \nrecord. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position.

She worked for a \ncompany subcontracting for her current employer from 2014 until she was hired by her \ncurrent employer in 2015. She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held \nsince about 2015. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree that she earned in 2013. She married in \nSeptember 2012, separated for a period in 2016, reconciled, separated permanently in \n2020, and divorced in 2021. She remarried in February 2022. She has a five-year-old \nchild from her first marriage. ((Tr.) at 24, 29-33, 43, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 2) \nApplicant was in a car accident in about 2010 or 2011 in which her leased car \nwas rear-ended and pushed into the car in front of hers. She sustained medical injuries. \nShe had to hire a lawyer to assist in collecting her damages. The case was settled \nabout three years later, but her finances suffered in the interim. (Tr. at 21-22; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant was harassed by another employee in about 2011. She brought it to \nthe attention of her employer who did nothing about it. She quit because she did not feel \nsafe. She was denied unemployment compensation because she quit. She did not find \nsuitable employment immediately, which led to more financial problems. (Tr. at 18-23 \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in June 2012. There were no \nsecured claims or unsecured priority claims. There were $22,431 in unsecured \nnonpriority claims. Her debts were discharged in October 2012, shortly after she \nmarried her first husband. She completed credit counseling and financial management \ncourses as a requirement of her bankruptcy. (Tr. at 18, 22, 34; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1, 2, 5) \nApplicant and her first husband had marital difficulties in 2016. The family\u2019s \nfinances contributed to the difficulties. Applicant is organized about her finances, and \nher ex-husband is not. He opened some accounts without her knowledge. They \nseparated in 2016 when he essentially kicked her out of the house. (Tr. at 24-26, 35-36; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband could not pay the bills on his own while they were \nseparated, and he decided to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Applicant did not want \nto file bankruptcy again, and she was likely precluded from filing because of her 2012 \nbankruptcy, but it was his choice to make. She has happy with her bankruptcy attorney \nin 2012, so she recommended him to her husband. (Tr. at 24-26, 36-40, 49; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in February 2016. He \nreported that he had two vehicles and two motorcycles. Under Schedule D: Creditors \nWho Have Claims Secured by Property, the petition listed a mortgage loan and loans \nfor the two vehicles and two motorcycles.

He \ndecided to surrender the two vehicles and one of the motorcycles, and he reaffirmed the \nloan for the second motorcycle. His dischargeable debts were discharged in June 2016. \n(Tr. at 27-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s 2012 bankruptcy and four charged-off debts totaling \nabout $42,900. The debts are all joint debts with Applicant\u2019s ex-husband. Three of the \ndebts consist of the deficiency balances owed on the loans for the two vehicles and the \nmotorcycle that her ex-husband returned as part of his bankruptcy. The fourth debt is a \njoint credit card debt. All of the debts were listed in her ex-husband\u2019s bankruptcy petition \nand discharged against him. (Tr. at 24-27; GE 6) \nApplicant discovered during their separation that she was pregnant with her and \nher ex-husband\u2019s child. They reconciled after about four to five months and had a child \ntogether. They lived in a community property state. As such, in general, a bankruptcy \nfiled by one spouse prevents the creditors from collecting against the other spouse, \neven if the other spouse was not a party to the bankruptcy. This was relayed to her by \nthe bankruptcy attorney, who knew she had been through her own bankruptcy in 2012. \n(Tr. at 26-29, 39c, 54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nThe discharge order signed by the bankruptcy court judge contains the following \nlanguage: \nIn a case involving community property: Special rules protect certain \ncommunity property owned by the debtor\u2019s spouse, even if that spouse did \nnot file a bankruptcy case.  \nThe order also contained the following: \nThis information is only a general summary of the bankruptcy discharge: \nsome exceptions exist. Because the law is complicated, you should \nconsult an attorney to determine the exact effect of the discharge in this \ncase. (GE 6)  \nIn June 2020, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s bankruptcy lawyer wrote a letter about \nthe SOR debts: \nAlthough [Applicant] was not included as a party on her husband\u2019s \nbankruptcy, she avails herself of the \u201ccommunity discharge.\u201d In community \nproperty states like [Applicant\u2019s state], after a married person files for \nbankruptcy, pre-petition creditors are enjoined from seeking recovery \nagainst the non-filing spouse, except for the spouse\u2019s separate property. \nAs long as [ex-husband] and [Applicant] remain married to each other, \n[Applicant\u2019s] income and all community assets are not attachable by any \npre-petition creditor discharged in [ex-husband\u2019s] bankruptcy. As a \npractical matter, because [Applicant] has no separate property and her \nincome is a community asset, pre-petition creditors such as those listed \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabove are enjoined from levying or garnishing anything from [Applicant]. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nIn layperson\u2019s terms, what this means is that in a community property state (such \nas Applicant\u2019s), the non-filing spouse\u2019s debts are not discharged in bankruptcy, but the \nnon-filing spouse\u2019s community property is protected from creditors. That is a subtle \ndifference that may be lost on most laypeople (and some non-bankruptcy attorneys). \nLanguage such as \u201ccommunity discharge\u201d only serves to make it more confusing. To \nfurther complicate matters, there may be an exception if the non-filing spouse filed a \nbankruptcy within the previous six years. \nApplicant relied on the statements by her ex-husband\u2019s bankruptcy attorney and \nbelieved the debts were discharged or the functional equivalent of a discharge, and she \nmade no effort to pay them. The creditors likely also considered the debts discharged or \nat least uncollectable. She never heard from any of the creditors after the bankruptcy. \nNone of the debts are reported to have been transferred to a collection company. (Tr. at \n39-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s finances are otherwise in good shape. As indicated above, she was \nthe financially responsible one in her first marriage. She has accrued no new delinquent \ndebts since her ex-husband\u2019s bankruptcy. She has a good and stable job. Her new \nhusband owns an e-commerce business and has no debt except their mortgage. (Tr. at \n30-31, 45-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A) \nApplicant submitted a letter from a work colleague and friend attesting to her \nimpeccable moral character and positive job performance. She is praised for her work \nethic, dedication, and trustworthiness. (AE B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a 2012 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge and delinquent debts that she held jointly with her ex-husband. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 bankruptcy on its own has little current security significance. It is \nmitigated. Regarding her more recent financial issues and the SOR debts, this is an \nunusual case. Applicant\u2019s ex-husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case while they \nwere separated. She did not want to file bankruptcy again, and she was likely precluded \nfrom filing because of her 2012 bankruptcy, but it was his choice to make. \nThey lived in a community property state and his bankruptcy attorney, who was \nalso her bankruptcy attorney on her 2012 case, told her that the \u201ccommunity discharge\u201d \nprotected her. She believed the debts were discharged or the functional equivalent of a \ndischarge, and made no effort to pay them. The creditors likely also considered the \ndebts discharged or at least uncollectable. She never heard from any of the creditors \nafter the bankruptcy. Because of her previous bankruptcy, the creditors may have been \nable to pursue Applicant, but she did not know that, and it is likely the creditors did not \nknow it either. I do not expect Applicant to understand the intricacies of bankruptcy law, \nparticularly when she followed the advice of a bankruptcy attorney. With the exception \nof the SOR debts, her current finances are sound. She and her new husband are on a \nsound financial footing. \nThe SOR debts have not been paid. However, a security clearance adjudication \nis not a debt collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n21, 2010). I believe that Applicant\u2019s actions, under the limited circumstance of this case, \nwere reasonable and responsible. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were largely beyond her control and she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. They occurred under such unique \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur. Her finances do not cast doubt on her \ncurrent judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 3.a-d, and 3.f-h. He denied allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.e. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He served in the Army National Guard from 1994-2000, and received an honorable discharge. He has taken some college courses, but has not earned a degree. He has held a security clearance since 2001, and his last clearance application was granted in 2011. He was married in 2005 and divorced in 2015. He has worked in IT for a large defense contractor since 2014. (Item 3) After Applicants divorce, he pursued relationships with women he met through online dating sites. Some of these women were foreign nationals living in other countries. He would communicate with these women through email and video calls. There were occasions where he would use his work email address to correspond with them. He did not report his contacts with foreign women through the appropriate security channels at work. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6) Although Applicant attempted to meet these women in person, there is no evidence in the record that he was successful.

He \ndenied allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.e. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the Army National Guard from 1994-2000, \nand received an honorable discharge. He has taken some college courses, but has not \nearned a degree. He has held a security clearance since 2001, and his last clearance \napplication was granted in 2011. He was married in 2005 and divorced in 2015. He has \nworked in IT for a large defense contractor since 2014. (Item 3) \nAfter Applicants divorce, he pursued relationships with women he met through \nonline dating sites. Some of these women were foreign nationals living in other countries. \nHe would communicate with these women through email and video calls. There were \noccasions where he would use his work email address to correspond with them. He did \nnot report his contacts with foreign women through the appropriate security channels at \nwork. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6) \nAlthough Applicant attempted to meet these women in person, there is no evidence \nin the record that he was successful. In his most substantial online dating relationship, \nthe woman repeatedly withdrew right before the meetings were scheduled to take place. \nIn a four-month period in 2016, he submitted about twelve vacation notices, which he \ncanceled shortly before or after the start of his scheduled leave. This unusual behavior \nwas noticed at work. He also shared details of these relationships with co-workers, \nincluding that he had met a Russian woman online. They notified security personnel out \nof concern for Applicant, and because of the potential security risk posed by his online \nactivities. (Item 4, 5, 6) \nAfter receiving reports about Applicant\u2019s contact with foreign women, his employer \nlaunched an investigation. It found that he failed to report his contact with foreign \nnationals, and that he was deliberately deceptive with investigators. Co-workers reported \nthat he told them that he was talking to two Russian women, a women from Colombia, \nand a woman from Costa Rica. Security personnel were concerned that he may be \ndivulging too much information to these women, and that he may be targeted. They did \nan analysis of his work computer, and found that he used his work email account to \ncorrespond with two women, one who was a Russian national, the other was located in \nSouth Africa. Although he claimed that the Russian woman was like a pen pal, the \ninvestigation found correspondence stating that Applicant wanted her to come live with \nhim, and discussed the potential of marriage. They also found blank immigration forms \non his computer. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant asserted that the woman in South Africa was a U.S. citizen because she \nshowed him her passport on a video call. He claimed that she was a fashion designer \nfrom Beverly Hills, who resided in South Africa for work. He claimed that she was unable \nto return to the U.S. because of passport and visa issues.

He later learned that she had been deceiving him, and claims to have ended \nthe relationship in 2016. (Item 4, 6) \nIn 2016, Applicant told security officials that he would stop all communications if \nhe discovered the women he met online were foreign nationals. However, the record \nshows that he continued to contact foreign women until at least 2018. After the \ninvestigation concluded in June 2016, he was suspended for two days without pay. He \nwas fired in 2018 for mischarging time. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6) \nIn his 2019 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant did not \nreport that he was fired from his job. He told the investigator that he resigned so that he \ncould take another job, and left on good terms. After the interview concluded, he sent an \nemail later that day to the investigator and admitted that he had not been truthful about \nleaving his employment, and informed them that he had been terminated because of a \ntime charging audit. (Item 4) \nApplicant has about $72,000 in charged-off debt. He stated that his financial \nproblems started in late 2015, after meeting a woman online. The record shows that he \nis referring to the woman in South Africa. He reported that he took out personal loans to \nsend her money for living expenses and materials to design clothes. He asserted that she \nwas supposed to pay him back, but did not. (Answer; Item 4) \nApplicant stated that he made mistakes that were neither in his best interest, nor \nthat of his employer or the government. He asserted that it was not his intent to meet \nforeign women online, and it was not his intent to use his email for personal use outside \nof work. He claimed that he did not receive training from his employer about meeting \nforeign nationals on dating websites, and that he had no experience with foreign nationals \nprior to this time. He asserted that he did not discuss classified information with anyone \noutside of his job. He claimed that when he was terminated in 2018, he was told that it \nwas an internal incident and could not be reported to the government. He stated that since \nthe investigator did not discuss his termination in his background interview, he did not \nmention it first. He claims that he had no intent to deceive the government. He stated that \nfor 27 years he has been in either the military or working as a contractor supporting the \nmilitary, and he will do whatever it takes to continue to serve in this role. He reports that \nhe has been married since November 2020, and has learned from his past indiscretions \n(Answer; Response) \nThe SOR allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant was the subject of an investigation by his employer in 2016, \nwhich confirmed that he used his work email address to correspond with foreign nationals \nthat he encountered on dating websites, including two women who identified themselves \nas Russian nationals.

He \ndenied the allegation. In his Answer, he claimed that the woman was a U.S. citizen who \nwas living in California when they met. He claimed that although she did some work in \nSouth Africa, her permanent address was in California. He admitted taking out personal \nloans to assist her clothing design business. He claimed that some of the money from the \nloans was wired to her, and the rest he used for his personal expenses. He reported that \nthey dated in 2016, but he terminated the relationship after finding out she was a liar and \ndishonest about her business practices. He claimed that he is working on paying his debt. \n(Item 4, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant was fired from his job in about 2018 for time mischarging. He \nadmitted the allegation. (Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant falsified material facts in his January 2019 background \ninterview with a government investigator by stating that he resigned his job on good terms \nto accept another offer, and deliberately sought to conceal that he was fired in 2018 for \ntime mischarging. He denied the allegation. In his Answer, he claimed that it was not his \nintent to conceal his termination. He thought that the government would have already \nknown about his termination, since it occurred five months prior. He claimed that he was \nembarrassed and ashamed, but he should have been truthful. He claims that he wrote a \nletter of amendment immediately afterwards and sent it to the investigator, to inform them \nof his misinformation. (Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as a foreign influence security \nconcern. He denied the allegation. In his Answer, he stated that he was not aware of the \nreporting policies regarding online dating and reporting foreign contacts. He claimed that \nhe had no experience with foreign nationals prior to this time. (Item 4, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is a charged-off account for $10,352.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following is potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record of Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16 (b) and (c) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(a) partially applies. Applicant did make a prompt effort to correct his \nconcealment and falsification. However, his explanation for his falsification is not credible. \nAlso, considering the fact that his employer\u2019s investigation found that he was deliberately \ndeceptive with investigators, he has shown multiple instances of lack of candor when he \nis being investigated. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. Providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information concerning relevant facts is not minor. This is the second instance \nin the record where Applicant was deceptive in an investigation. He has repeatedly \ndemonstrated questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. There is insufficient evidence to find there is mitigation by the passage of \ntime, the behavior is infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant maintains contact with any foreign \nnationals. He stated that he was remarried in 2020. He is not meeting foreign nationals \non dating websites anymore. There is insufficient evidence to establish AG \u00b6 7(a), so \nSOR \u00b6 2(a) is found for Applicant. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nSOR \u00b6 3.e was resolved in February 2021, and is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply to the remaining SOR debts. Applicant failed to provide sufficient \nevidence showing that any of the remaining SOR debts are resolved, or that they became \ndelinquent under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of his current financial situation, or evidence which might establish his \nability to address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his delinquent debt is recent, \nongoing, and not isolated. His failure to meet his financial obligations continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to find that \nthe conditions that resulted in his charged-off accounts were largely beyond his control, \nand that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation of \npayment arrangements or of any payments made on his debts, other than for SOR \u00b6 3.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service. I also considered that he \nwas deliberately deceptive with investigators on at least two occasions. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines E, B, and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct and delinquent debts under Guidelines E and F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.f - 3.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(GE 5, 6) \nJordan \nIn AN 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of January 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Jordan and the current \nconditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Amman as being a high threat \nlocation for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Local, \nregional, and transnational terrorist groups and individual extremists have demonstrated \na willingness and capacity to plan and execute attacks in Jordan. \nJordan continues to face a threat of persistent terrorist activity, both domestically \nand along it borders. Part of the threat is due to its proximity to the conflicts in Syria and \nIraq, as well as its rejection of the Salafi-Jihadi interpretations of Islam. \nViolent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including ISIS, have conducted or \nsupported attacks in Jordan, and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and \nwestern interests, and soft public targets. \nJordan has taken a prominent role in the coalition to defeat ISIS. However, regional \nissues and U.S involvement in the region can inflame anti-U.S./western sentiment. \nRecent surveys show that more than 80% of the population holds an unfavorable view of \nthe U.S. government. \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Jordan. The government has \ntaken some limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed \nabuses. \nLebanon \nIn AN 2, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of January 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Lebanon and the current \nconditions in county. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \nThe U.S. Department of State has urged U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to \nLebanon due to crime, terrorism, armed conflict, civil unrest, kidnapping, and our \nembassy\u2019s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. It advises a \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d \nwarning to the border and refugee areas due to the potential for armed conflict. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Syrian conflict has affected the county economically and socially. More than \na million Syrian refugees have strained the country\u2019s weak infrastructure and ability to \ndeliver social services.  \nTerrorist groups operating in Lebanon include ISIS, and Hizballah, which is closely \nallied with Iran. Hizballah has a strong influence in the country and actively participates \nin the political system and runs social programs. \nHizballah has been responsible for terrorist attacks that have killed U.S. citizens \nand military personnel. Its presence continues to impede effective government action \nagainst terrorist incidents. \nThe U.S. has recently prosecuted several persons connected to Lebanon and \nHizballah for espionage, terrorism, and export violations. \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Lebanon, although the \ngovernment structure exists to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses, \ngovernment officials enjoyed a measure of impunity. \nTurkey \nIn AN 3, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of January 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Turkey and the current \nconditions in county. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \nTurkey is a NATO ally, a regional partner, and an important security partner. The \nU.S. has committed to improving its relationship with Turkey.  \nThe U.S. Department of State urges travelers to exercise increased caution due to \nterrorism and arbitrary detentions. Parts of Turkey have increased risk, including areas \nnear the Syrian border. Terrorist attacks have occurred in Turkey over the last several \nyears. \nTerror groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists have \npreviously attacked U.S. interests in Turkey, including the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, the \nU.S. Consulate General in Istanbul, and the U.S. Consulate in Adana.  \nThe U.S. has sanctioned Turkey\u2019s defense industry for engaging in transactions \nwith a Russian arms export entity.  \nTurkey is a member of the coalition to defeat ISIS. It has provided air space and \nfacilities for coalition operations in Iraq and Syria. \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Turkey. The government has \nused anti-terror legislation to restrict freedoms and compromise the rule of law. There \nhave been politically motivated reprisals, including violence and threats of violence \nagainst persons in opposition to or critical of the government. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKuwait \nIn AN 4, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of January 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Kuwait and the current \nconditions in county. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \nThe U.S. and Kuwait have a long history of friendship and cooperation. In 1991, \nthe U.S. led a multinational coalition to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. In 2003, \nKuwait provided a platform for operations in Iraq, and has played a similar role in the fight \nto defeat ISIS. Kuwait is also a partner in U.S counterterrorism efforts. \nIn the 2021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices issued by the U.S. \nDepartment of State, it identified human rights concerns in Kuwait. The concerns included \ncredible reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by \ngovernment agents; arbitrary arrest; serious restrictions on free expression, the internet, and \nthe media; and substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom \nof association. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology;  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and foreign contacts are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nA heightened security risk in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Kuwait is established \nby the administratively noticed facts in the record. The security risks include the risk of \nterrorism and the human-rights records of these countries. \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters and two friends, with whom he maintains close and \ncontinuing contact, are citizens or residents of countries with a heightened security risk. \nOne of these friends has ties to an official of high rank in a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s \nlongstanding connection to Kuwait presents a conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \napply. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and   \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant failed provide sufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant and his family has lived in the U.S. since 2017, he failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence to find that there is no conflict of interest between his sense \nof loyalty or obligation to his foreign contacts, his allegiance and connection to Kuwait is \nminimal, and that he has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in the favor of the U.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that his contact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. He maintains frequent \ncontact with his sisters, and he continues to have a close bond of affection and obligation \nfor them. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not present sufficient \nevidence of his ties to the United States to overcome the concerns about his interest and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nties to Kuwait.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 18, 2022, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

He did not respond to the FORM, and the case was \nassigned to me on October 3, 2022. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 10 delinquent debts \nexceeding $119,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the alleged delinquent \ndebts with explanations. He claimed he faced challenging conditions in his personal life, \ninclusive of having a difficult deployment schedule during his military tour of duty, a \nlengthy legal separation, and a loss of all of his properties and assets in his name, \nattributable to a hurricane. He also claimed he used poor judgment in managing his \nfinances; he has received debt counseling from his military services; and he has \nexplored legal options to settle his debts. He claimed, too, that as a last resort he is \nconsidering bankruptcy to resolve the debts he cannot otherwise pay. Finally, he \nclaimed he accepts full responsibility for his financial mistakes and understands the \nreasons for questioning his clearance eligibility. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

His manifest failure to address these debts raises trust, reliability, \nand judgment concerns about his current and future ability to manage his finances \nsafely and responsibly. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201dinability to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each \nof these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debt accumulations require no independent proof \nto substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debt accruals are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n                              \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent accounts are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-\n00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).  \nWithout any evidence of payment or other successful resolution of his cited \ndelinquent debts, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions are available to \nApplicant. In the past, the Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens \non applicants to provide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial \nproblems, whether the issues relate to consumer, medical, or other debts and accounts. \nSee ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-\n01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). \n \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of accumulation of delinquent debts over \nconsiderable period of time is fully compatible with minimum standards for holding a \nsecurity clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his military service and work \nin the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his repeated \nfailures or inability to address his delinquent accounts in a timely way over the course of \nmany years. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been \nestablished. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for him to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with his finances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security \nclearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 62-year-old instrument repairer employed by a defense contractor since September 1982. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1978 to August 1982. He married in November 1990. Applicant received a security clearance shortly after he was hired by a defense contractor in September 1982. (GX 5 at 2.) He applied to continue his clearance in June 2008. His application was denied in September 2008 after a hearing by an administrative judge. (GX 5.) He applied again in March 2012, and his application was denied. (GX 1 at 32.). After he reapplied in 2013, his security clearance was reinstated. In January 1990, Applicant was charged with felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. At the hearing, he testified that he was riding in a car with two other individuals, but he did not know that the driver had marijuana in the car. (Tr. 33-34.) The record indicates that he was represented by an attorney and pleaded guilty to a 2 misdemeanor to avoid risking a jail sentence. He was convicted of misdemeanor possession of marijuana and was fined. (GX 5 at 2.) In October 1994, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana. He testified that he was visiting a young woman outside an apartment comp",

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 21, \n2021. Scheduling of the hearing was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The case was \nassigned to me on December 21, 2021. \nOn January 10, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on \nJanuary 27, 2022. The hearing was cancelled on January 25, 2022, after Applicant \ncontracted COVID. It was rescheduled for February 3, 2022, but it was cancelled again \ndue to technical difficulties with the video teleconference system. The hearing was \nrescheduled to be conducted in person on March 8, 2022. I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D and \nadmitted without objection. \nI kept the record open until March 22, 2020, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E through J, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 16, 2022. \nAmendment of SOR \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 4.a, alleging \nfalsification of the SCA, by striking the words \u201c1.a through 1.c and,\u201d because the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c occurred after the SCA was submitted. I granted the \nmotion. (Tr. 10.) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.g, \n2.a-2.d, 3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 4.a and 4.b. His admissions in \nhis answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old instrument repairer employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 1982. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1978 to \nAugust 1982. He married in November 1990. \nApplicant received a security clearance shortly after he was hired by a defense \ncontractor in September 1982. (GX 5 at 2.) He applied to continue his clearance in June \n2008. His application was denied in September 2008 after a hearing by an administrative \njudge. (GX 5.) He applied again in March 2012, and his application was denied. (GX 1 at \n32.). After he reapplied in 2013, his security clearance was reinstated. \nIn January 1990, Applicant was charged with felony possession of marijuana with \nintent to distribute. At the hearing, he testified that he was riding in a car with two other \nindividuals, but he did not know that the driver had marijuana in the car. (Tr. 33-34.)

He was convicted of misdemeanor \npossession of marijuana and was fined. (GX 5 at 2.) \nIn October 1994, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana. He testified \nthat he was visiting a young woman outside an apartment complex. He gave the woman \nhis jacket because it was cold. She walked inside the apartment complex and then \nreturned, wearing the jacket. While she was inside, security guards challenged Applicant \nfor being in the apartment complex and asked for identification. His identification was in \nhis car, but he responded that he did not have any identification. After Applicant was \narrested for trespassing, the young woman gave his jacket to the police, who found \nmarijuana in the pocket. (Tr. 35-39.) Court records reflect that he pleaded guilty to \nmisdemeanor possession of marijuana. Although he testified that he was also convicted \nof trespassing, a trespassing charge is not reflected in the record. He was sentenced to \n30 days in jail (suspended) and fined $100 (GX 4 at 13.) \nIn August 1998, Applicant was stopped for making an illegal stop on a highway to \nlet a passenger out of his vehicle. His arrest occurred during a time that a labor strike was \nongoing. He submitted to a breathalyzer and was charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol (DUI). (Tr. 41-42.) He was convicted and required to attend an alcohol-\neducation program once a week for six months. (GX 5 at 3.) He completed the program \nas required. (Tr. 42.) \nIn September 2000, Applicant was charged with felony possession of cocaine. \nDuring his September 2019 security interview, he told an investigator that a bag \ncontaining a few rocks of cocaine was found nearby in a parking lot. During the interview \nand at his hearing, he denied that the cocaine was his. (GX 2 at 15; Tr. 42-43.) He pleaded \nnot guilty, but he was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail (suspended) and one \nyear of supervised probation. (GX 4 at 11.) \nIn July 2009, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana, drunk in public \nand felony assault on a law enforcement officer. He testified that one of his sons had \nhidden a marijuana cigarette in the garage. When he found it, he confronted his son while \nholding it in his hand. He had consumed alcohol and admitted that he was \u201ca little irate.\u201d \nA police officer approached and told Applicant he needed to go into the house. The record \ndoes not reflect what caused the police officer to approach the house. Applicant told the \npolice officer that he was in his own yard and that he would not go into the house. The \nfactual basis for charging him with felony assault on a law enforcement officer is not \nreflected in the record. The charges of marijuana possession and drunk in public were \ndisposed of by nolle prosequi. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he was convicted of \nmisdemeanor assault and battery and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 160 days \nsuspended. (GX 4 at 5.) He served his jail time on weekends. He testified that the charge \nof felony assault was in retribution for \u201ctalking back\u201d to the police officer, and his guilty \nplea to misdemeanor assault and battery was a non-negotiable element of his plea \nagreement.

At the hearing, he testified that he hit a broken drainage grate in the road and ran \ninto a retaining wall. The airbags went off and he was stunned. He had no memory of \nrefusing a blood or breath test. He told a security investigator that he requested a blood \ntest, which was refused. (GX 2 at 12.) He pleaded guilty to reckless driving and was \nsentenced to 12 months in jail (suspended), unsupervised probation for two years, and a \n$250 fine. He was required to participate in 26-week substance-abuse program, which he \ncompleted. (GX 2 at 10; GX 4 at 1-2.) The charge of refusing a blood or breath test was \ndisposed of by nolle prosequi. (GX 4 at 3) He testified that he did not inform his employer \nabout this incident because he was convicted only of reckless driving and not an alcohol-\nrelated conviction. \nApplicant testified that he usually consumed two or three beers a day before the \nMarch 2016 incident. Now that he has started attending church, he seldom drinks beer, \nbut when he does, it is not more than two beers. He last consumed two beers at a wedding \non the weekend before his hearing. He has not received any treatment for alcohol use \nsince he completed the court-ordered 26-week program after his conviction in March \n2016. The program included attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but he did \nnot actively participate in the meetings or continue his attendance after completing the \nprogram. (Tr. 60-63.) \nOn July 4, 2019, Applicant used cocaine at a party, and he subsequently tested \npositive for cocaine on a urinalysis test. He held an active security clearance at the time. \nDuring a security interview in September 2019, he told an investigator that he had invited \nfriends to join him for a July 4 party, that a friend brought cocaine to the party, and that \nhe snorted two lines of his friend\u2019s cocaine at the party. At the hearing, Applicant testified \nthat his use of cocaine was not due to peer pressure, but \u201cjust a little stupidity\u201d on his part. \n(Tr. 68-69.) After he tested positive in the urinalysis, he was referred to the Employee \nAssistance Program. He was enrolled in a six-week program at a behavioral health \nfacility, which he successfully completed. (GX 2 at 14) The SOR alleges that he was \ndiagnosed with cocaine use disorder (moderate), and Applicant admitted the allegation-\nin his answer to the SOR. However, at the hearing, he testified that he was unaware of \nany diagnosis. There is no evidence of a diagnosis in the record. Applicant testified that \nthe friend who brought cocaine to the party lives in another area and it has been years \nsince they have had any contact. (Tr. 68.) He testified that he no longer associates with \ndrug-users. (Tr. 92.) \nWhen Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in February 2019, he answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to the questions in Section 22, which included asking if he had ever been charged \nwith any felony offense and if he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol \nor drugs. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the questions in Section 23, asking if he had illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, if he had ever used or \notherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security \nclearance, and if he had ever been ordered, advised or asked to seek counseling or \ntreatment as a result of illegal use of drugs or controlled substances.

However, the following facts were established. Applicant was generally familiar with \nthe security-clearance process. He received a security clearance around 1983. He had \npreviously submitted two paper versions of the SCA in 2006 and 2008 and two electronic \nversions in 2013 and 2019. He found the completion of an SCA \u201creally hard stuff\u201d and he \nhad been \u201cpinged\u201d by an administrative judge in 2008 for not disclosing all his criminal \nconduct. (Tr. 78; GX 5 at 3.) He had admitted during his 2008 hearing that he did not \nreport his criminal conduct because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 44; GX 5 at 3.) The record \ndoes not reflect what Applicant disclosed in the SCAs he submitted in 2012 and 2013. He \ntestified that when he was filling out the 2019 SCA, he asked a woman, whose identity \nand duties are not reflected in the record, whether he needed to \u201cgo all the way back.\u201d \nThe woman replied that she did not know. Applicant testified that he believed that \u201cthe \ngovernment\u201d already knew about his criminal record, and so he did not disclose it in the \nSCA. (Tr. 73-75.). \nDuring a follow-up interview in September 2019, Applicant initially denied any \nillegal drug use during the past seven years. After the investigator asked him about \ninvolvement in any drug incidents at work, he disclosed his cocaine use and positive \nurinalysis in July 2019. (GX 2 at 14; Tr. 89.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed some of his criminal record to racism, resulting \nin arrests and charges that would otherwise have not occurred. (Tr. 19-24.) I have \nconsidered his concern, especially with respect to his arrest for marijuana possession in \nJanuary 1990, his arrest for trespassing in October 1994, his arrest for making an illegal \nstop on a highway in 1998, and his arrest for being drunk in public in July 2009. \nIn May 2019, Applicant was selected by his employer as an \u201cExcellence in Action\u201d \nhonoree for his outstanding performance of duty. (AX F.) In September 2020, he received \nan \u201con-the-spot\u201d recognition certificate for \u201chonesty and integrity when no one was \nlooking.\u201d He had raised a \u201cred flag\u201d on a ship\u2019s hull after noticing that cables were \ndamaged. (AX A.) \nApplicant\u2019s general foreman attested to his unquestionable integrity, technical \nknowledge, deck-plate experience, and leadership. (AX E.) A coworker who has known \nApplicant for almost 40 years describes him as dependable, responsible, honest, \ntalented, and patriotic. (AX G.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges the following conduct by Applicant: \n\uf0b7 He used cocaine in July 2019 while having access to classified information \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), tested positive in a urinalysis (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and received \noutpatient treatment from July 2019 to September 2019 for cocaine use\u2014 \nmoderate (SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.c).  \n\uf0b7 He was charged with marijuana possession in July 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n\uf0b7 He was arrested and charged in September 2000 for felony possession of \ncocaine and sentenced to five years\u2019 confinement (suspended), 10 years\u2019 \nunsupervised probation, one year of supervised probation, and court costs \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n\uf0b7 He was arrested and charged in October 1994 with marijuana possession, \npleaded guilty, and was sentenced to confinement for 30 days (suspended) \nand fined $100 plus court costs (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n\uf0b7 He was arrested and charged in January 1990 with felony possession of \nmarijuana with intent to distribute and convicted of misdemeanor \npossession of marijuana and fined.

I have noted the \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant\u2019s treatment for cocaine use. The treatment was a \nconsequence of his cocaine use, but not a separate disqualifying act. Therefore, I have \nresolved SOR 1.c for Applicant. The remaining allegations under this guideline are \nestablished.  \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAt the hearing, Applicant asserted that he was not guilty of felony possession of \ncocaine in September 2000, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and cross-alleged under Guideline J in \nSOR \u00b6 3.b. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, he is estopped from denying his guilt \nof this felony conviction. The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA \nhearings and precludes applicants from contending that they did not engage in criminal \nacts for which they were convicted. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, \n1997). There are exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect to misdemeanor \nconvictions based on guilty pleas, but they are not applicable to this felony conviction. \nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel does not preclude applicants from explaining their \nconduct and presenting it in a meaningful context, in an effort to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by it. ISCR Case No. 11-00180 at 7 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. The first prong of this mitigating condition of AG \u00b6 \n26(a) (happened so long ago) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. \nThere are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant \nperiod of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an administrative \njudge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances \nor conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).

His drug involvement \nhas been frequent and did not occur under unusual circumstances. He admits that his \nuse of cocaine while holding a security clearance was an act of stupidity. His use of \ncocaine while holding a security clearance and while a decision was pending on his \napplication to continue his clearance was a grave breach of trust that casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established.

An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established. Applicant had considerable experience with completing \nan SCA. He has a history of attempting to conceal his drug involvement in order to protect \nhis security clearance. He knew that the literal meaning of the questions required him to \ndisclose his drug involvement. His negative answers to some of the questions in Section \n23 were correct, because he had not been involved with drugs during the seven years \npreceding his SCA, and his only drug-related treatment was after he submitted the SCA. \nHowever, Applicant first received a security clearance around 1983, and he was \ncharged with multiple felonies, drug-related offenses, and alcohol-related offenses while \nholding a clearance. His answers to the two questions in Section 22 were false, but \nfalsifying the answers to the Section 22 questions was not alleged. Thus, Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of the Section 22 questions may not be a basis for revoking his clearance, but \nI will consider it for the limited purposes of deciding whether a particular adjudicative \nguideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; to consider whether an Applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and as part of my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at \n4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his answers in Section 23 are sufficient to establish AG \n\u00b6 16(a).

However, one of the questions in Section 23 was whether he had \never used or otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while \npossessing and security clearance. He falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question and did not \ndisclose the drug-related arrests that occurred between about 1983 and 2008, while he \nheld a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) is established. During the follow-up interview in September 2019, \nApplicant denied any illegal drug use during the last seven years. He did not disclose the \npositive urinalysis until the investigator asked him about drug involvement at work, which \napparently caused Applicant to believe that the security investigator knew about it. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.; \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct his omissions \nfrom the SCA until seven months later, after he realized that a security investigator \nprobably knew about his positive urinalysis. Similarly, he did not \u201ccorrect\u201d his false answer \nto the investigator\u2019s questions in September 2019 until he was asked about drug \ninvolvement at work. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Falsification during the security-clearance process \nis not \u201cminor.\u201d It \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications have not occurred \nunder unique circumstances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, G, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. I have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and \nhis long service as a contractor employee. I have considered the accolades he has \nreceived for his technical expertise, loyalty, and dependability. I have considered his \nrecent involvement in his church and the reputation that he has developed in the church \ncommunity. However, his serious breach of trust by using cocaine while holding a security \nclearance and while a decision on his most recent SCA was pending, combined with his \nlack of candor during the security-clearance process, leave me with grave doubts about \nhis trustworthiness and good judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines H, G, J, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis alcohol consumption, but he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndrug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (drugs): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g; \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (alcohol): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (criminal conduct) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E (personal conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred eight delinquent debts, the majority of which remain unpaid. I \nfind both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although he paid two \nof the smaller debts and made two payments towards another debt, he failed to document \nany payments toward the remaining debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s underemployment and his wife\u2019s unemployment were circumstances \nbeyond his control. However, he did not act responsibly concerning the debts when he \nfailed to attempt to resolve them in a timely fashion. The two debt payments he made \nwere after the issuance of the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant presented some evidence of financial counseling. However, his track \nrecord to date does not support a good financial picture and his admission about living \npaycheck to paycheck does not bode well for the future. While he did resolve two small \ndebts and make one payment toward a larger debt, these actions are too little, too late. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployment, his \nunderemployment and his wife\u2019s unemployment, and his supervisor\u2019s letter of support. \nHowever, I also considered that he has not adequately addressed the majority of his \ndelinquent debt. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt management, \nwhich causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts in the future.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1d, 1.f-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.e, 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "full_text": "1 \n    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n     DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \n______________ \n______________ \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n) \nISCR Case No. 20-00898 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Bryan Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Orest J. Jowyk, Esq. \n03/25/2022 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M. Administrative Judge: \nApplicant was terminated from his employment in May 2017 after a company \ninvestigation determined that he had accessed, downloaded, or stored pornography on \ncompany computer systems, in violation of company policy. Applicant acknowledged an \ninterest in pornography, but denied accessing any pornography on company computers. \nHe believes instead that such evidence was fabricated in an attempt to manufacture a \nreason for his termination. During that employment, Applicant also engaged in a romantic \nrelationship with a subordinate employee for a period of time, which was found to be \nadditional grounds for his termination. While Guideline D security concerns are mitigated, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns under \nGuidelines M and E. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 25, 2018. \nOn March 15, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline D (sexual conduct), Guideline \n\n2 \n \nM (use of information technology), and Guideline E (personal conduct). DOD issued the \nSOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017.  \n \nThrough his original counsel, Applicant answered the SOR allegations on April 1, \n2021, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case was assigned to me on September 7, 2021. On \nDecember 10, 2021, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for January 20, 2022.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. It was conducted via video-teleconference \nthrough an online platform. Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, all of which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nan affidavit, which was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without \nobjection. Two other witnesses also testified for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 1, 2022.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, and the cross-allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.b), \nApplicant admitted that his employment was terminated as alleged, but he otherwise \ndenied the allegations. He denied the allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.b. His answers also included \nnarrative explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and explanations are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 65 years old. He and his second wife married in 1991. She moved \nacross the country to take a new job in summer 2011; he filed for divorce in June 2012, \nand moved out of the marital home soon thereafter. (AE A at \u00b6 16; Tr. 26, 76-77, 105-106) \nThey divorced in September 2014. (GE 1 at 22-23; Tr. 75-76) Applicant remarried in June \n2017. (GE 1 at 21) \n \nApplicant has a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D., both in nuclear engineering. (Tr. 24) \nHe has been employed in the defense industry, with security clearances, for most of the \nlast 35 years, since at least 1987. (GE 1 at 14-17, 53-54, Tr. 25) He said he did not hold a \nclearance at the time of the hearing. (Tr. 8)  \n \nFrom 2002 until May 2017 when he was terminated, Applicant worked for company \n1. At the time, Applicant was the company\u2019s chief strategy and technology officer, as well \nas acting senior vice president and general manager. (GE 1; Tr. 98) Applicant has worked \nfor his current employer since July 2018, and is now the chief operating officer. (GE 1 at \n14; Tr. 102) \n\n3 \n \n \nIn September 2015, company 1 was acquired by a venture capital firm. A month \nlater, half of Applicant\u2019s responsibilities were re-organized under someone else. He came \nto believe he was being undermined. In January 2016, Applicant refused to sign an annual \nethics certification because he believed the business plan submitted to the venture capital \nfirm was inaccurate. The company\u2019s general counsel, Mr. F., requested that Applicant file a \nconfidential ethics complaint. The company\u2019s human resources (HR) director nonetheless \nsoon learned about it. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 20-28; Tr. 29-31) \n \nApplicant then offered his resignation but was soon promoted to chief strategy and \ntechnology officer, with primary responsibility for company 1\u2019s business with the U.S. Navy. \nAE A at \u00b6\u00b6 29-31; Tr. 72-73, 103) At the height of his responsibilities, Applicant had 900 \nfull-time and part-time employees. (Tr. 74) In the process, another employee, Mr. C, was \ndemoted, and Applicant became Mr. C\u2019s supervisor. (AE A at \u00b6 34; Tr. 31-32) For the next \nseveral months, Applicant had a dispute with his superiors over the fairness of his \nperformance bonus and salary increase, especially compared with Mr. C. He also sought to \nremove Mr. C due to ethics violations and sexual harassment complaints against Mr. C \nmade by female employees. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 34-50; Tr. 32-36) \n \n \nIn May 2017, company 1 conducted an investigation into Applicant\u2019s workplace \nconduct, including a romantic relationship with a subordinate employee in Applicant\u2019s chain \nof command, and the company\u2019s discovery that Applicant had accessed and downloaded \nan extensive collection of pornography on company computer systems. (GE 4) This alleged \nconduct, as detailed in GE 4, is the basis for the allegations and cross-allegations in the \nSOR. The Government offered GE 4 with redactions, as they received it from company 1. \n(Tr. 18)  \n \n \nGovernment Exhibit 4 was prepared by company 1\u2019s general counsel, Mr. F. Review \nof the report indicates that the investigation was initiated when Mr. F learned of the \nrelationship between Applicant and the subordinate employee in 2017, after the employee \nraised concerns about working for Applicant, given their prior romantic involvement. (GE 4 \nat 2) \n \n \nThe company\u2019s investigation concluded that Applicant had pursued and engaged in \na long-term relationship with a subordinate employee through early 2016. The report noted \nthat e-mails between Applicant and the employee also showed at various points that he \nexpressed his love for her, pressed her to commit to him, and provided her gifts, such as \nflowers and jewelry. (GE 4 at 4) The company concluded that he did not report the \nrelationship to the company, and did not take other steps to mitigate any risks to the \ncompany, such as potential claims of sexual harassment or a hostile workplace \nenvironment, or favoritism towards the subordinate employee in the promotion process, \neither real or perceived. (GE 4 at 1-2, 4)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that between August and December 2012, he had a \nconsensual sexual relationship with S, an administrative assistant at company 1. He said S \nreported to a manager who reported to Applicant. He said that S initiated the relationship. \n\n4 \n \nHe said the sexual relationship lasted between August and December 2012, and did not \nresume after that. (AE A at \u00b6 2-3; Tr. 26, 48, 77-78, 81-82, 84, 104-105) \n \n \nApplicant said that he was never S\u2019s direct supervisor, but he said he approved \npromotions or raises recommended to him by her direct supervisor. (AE A at \u00b6 14; Tr. 27, \n49, 79-81) Applicant said that S remained in his chain of command until he was promoted \nout of the organization. (Tr. 50) He is not aware of a company 1 policy prohibiting a \nromantic relationship such as between himself and S. (Tr. 89) \n  \n \nApplicant said he confirmed the relationship to company 1\u2019s human resources \ndirector in 2013 once he was asked about it. He said that that the CEO told him that he \nshould not have mentioned the relationship to a former company 1 employee, but that the \ncompany took no disciplinary action against Applicant at the time. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7; Tr. 27, \n52-53, 81, 103-104)  \n \n \nTo separate himself from S, Applicant moved to another branch office in the area for \nabout nine months; he also moved to another area office on two occasions, also to avoid \nS. Applicant testified that their sexual relationship did not extend beyond late 2012, though \nhe said that both parties later sought to renew the relationship, for different reasons, \nbetween 2013 and 2015. Applicant testified that he wanted a more public relationship, and \nwhile she at times sought to renew their affair, she wished to remain married. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 \n8-13; Tr. 28, 52-54, 81-86, 106-111)  \n \n \n \n Applicant and his third wife met online in about 2015, became serious by early 2016 \nand married in 2017. (Tr. 89-90) They now live in a state across the country from where \nApplicant lived when he was at company 1, and are happily married. Applicant regrets the \nrelationship with S and says there is no chance it will recur. (Tr. 47) \n \n \nThe rest of GE 4 concerns company 1\u2019s discovery that Applicant had downloaded, \naccessed, or stored \u201can extensive collection of pornography\u201d on company-owned computer \nsystems. Mr. F reported that on Tuesday, May 2, 2017, he entered Applicant\u2019s office during \nnormal business hours while Applicant was travelling and found an external hard drive \n(EHD) on Applicant\u2019s desk. The report indicates that Mr. F opened the drive and viewed, or \nattempted to view, its contents. (GE 4 at 2) \n \nIn GE 4, Mr. F reported that the contents of three directories on the drive included \nover 100 playlists and over 100 video clips, saved to the directory in 2009 or 2010, many \nwith sexually suggestive file names, as well as several hundred files, in Microsoft Word or \nAcrobat PDF format, some of an \u201cexplicit sexual nature,\u201d saved to the directory between \n2007 and 2012. (GE 4 at 2-3)  \n \nThe report indicates that Mr. F found these materials on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (GE \n4 at 2) The report also indicates that \u201cbased on these preliminary findings, on Monday, May \n1, 2017, [sic] [Mr. F] asked the IT department to remotely access Applicant\u2019s [company 1-\nprovided] computer\u201d for additional evidence of risk to the company. (GE 4 at 3) (In seeking \nto undermine GE 4. Applicant and his counsel drew attention to this date discrepancy, \n\n5 \n \nnoting that Mr. F could not have sought assistance from the IT department the day before \nhe found the inappropriate materials on the EHD. This date discrepancy is unexplained) \n \nOn May 3, 2017, Company 1\u2019s IT department notified Mr. F that they had found 50 \ngigabytes of \u201csuspect video and movie files\u201d found to contain file names suggesting they \ncontained pornographic images, videos, and documents. Later that day, they notified Mr. F \nthat \u201cthe offending files had been deleted by someone.\u201d The IT department also found a \nspreadsheet titled \u201cRecent Downloads list 4-8-17\u201d and a document detailing Applicant\u2019s \npersonal account information for his membership on an adult website, sent to his personal \ne-mail address. Mr. F printed the spreadsheet, which identified 280 unique files, identified \nby words and descriptors that \u201cstrongly suggest the existence of hardcore pornography.\u201d \nGE 4 at 3) According to GE 4, a review of Applicant\u2019s e-mail files also showed that from his \ncompany account to his personal email, he sent \u201ca 50-page document titled \u2018movielist.txt\u2019 \nthat identified the contents of an additional portable device containing more than 1,300 \nfiles,\u201d many with file names containing explicit pornographic terms. (GE 4 at 4) The memo \nfrom Mr. F is in the record (GE 4), but the underlying computer data is not.  \n \nCompany 1\u2019s internet policy prohibited \u201cbrowsing explicit pornographic . . . or other \nsites determined to be inappropriate\u201d and \u201cposting, sending, or acquiring sexually explicit or \nsexually oriented . . . or other material determined to be inappropriate.\u201d (GE 4 at 4) \nApplicant testified that he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d aware of that policy, since he had reviewed it, \ncommented on it, and approved it. (Tr. 97-98)  \n \nOn May 8, 2017, Applicant attended a morning meeting in a conference room at \ncompany 1\u2019s offices. (Tr. 40) He also had an office there. He believes that, when he left his \noffice for the meeting, his personal EHD was in his briefcase. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 60-62; Tr. 40-41) \nWhen Applicant arrived at the meeting, Mr. C was there, though he left the room for 10-15 \nminutes before coming back. (AE A at \u00b6 62; Tr. 41)  \n \nApplicant was away from his office all day, until about 6 PM. When he returned, the \ncompany general counsel, Mr. F, and the chief operating officer, Mr. S., entered his office \nto talk to him. They told him that a large amount of pornography had been found on his \ncompany tablet. They did not show him evidence of what they had found. AE A at \u00b6 65; Tr. \n42-43)  \n \n Applicant noticed that both his personal EHD and the company EHD were on his \ndesk. (Tr. 42) He said Mr. F picked up both the personal and company EHD, saw a label \non the personal item and put it down. (Tr. 71, 94) Applicant\u2019s company tablet and company \nEHD were seized, but they did not access the personal EHD at that time. (Tr. 71) Applicant \nwas told he was being placed on administrative leave. He packed his personal items and \nwas escorted from the building. (AE A at \u00b6 65; Tr. 43-44)  \n \n \nThe May 13, 2017 company 1 report concluded that \u201cas the senior-most manager \nleading a significant share of [company 1\u2019s] business, [Applicant\u2019s] behavior and judgment \nsets the wrong example and tone at the top, violates our Policies and Code, and exposes \n[company 1] to significant legal and reputational risk.\u201d (GE 4 at 4) Mr. F\u2019s conclusion, \n\n6 \n \nfollowing consultation with outside employment counsel, was that Applicant should be \nimmediately terminated for cause. (GE 4 at 4) \n \nApplicant was called to a meeting on May 15, 2017, with all of the company\u2019s \nexecutive managers. Mr. F told him that \u201cthey found a large amount of pornographic \nmaterial on my [company 1] tablet\u201d and that he was being dismissed as a result. (Tr. 44) \nThen and subsequently, Applicant requested to be shown what was found but was \nrebuffed. (Tr. 45) The record does not include a termination letter from company 1, but it is \nreasonable to infer that he was terminated for cause given the findings and conclusions in \nin GE 4 and the fact that he was terminated soon thereafter.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination led to an incident report in the Defense Department\u2019s JPAS. \n(GE 3). I therefore infer that he had a clearance at the time, as otherwise an incident report \nin JPAS would not have been made.  \n \nApplicant testified that company 1 had issued him a Microsoft \u201ctablet\u201d computer, as \nwell as a company-issued external hard drive (EHD), to back up the tablet and to provide \nspace for an e-mail archive. The tablet was not suitable for working at home, so he used \nhis personal computer. He also used a personal EHD to transfer company 1 information \n(work files) between his personal home computer and his work tablet. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 51-55; \nTr. 36-38, 55-58, 96, 107-108)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal EHD and the company-issued EHD looked alike, so he labeled \nthe personal EHD as such. (AE A at \u00b6 56, Tr. 58) He would connect the personal EHD to \nthe company tablet only when transferring company data to work on at home, or when \ntransferring company data back to his company tablet after he did so. Otherwise, he kept \nhis personal EHD in his briefcase. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58; Tr. 38-39, 64) He said he was careful \nto delete proprietary information from both his personal EHD and his personal home \ncomputer. (Tr. 59)  \n \nApplicant testified that he was asked to keep the company EHD at his office and not \n\u201ccarry it around\u201d because it contained company proprietary information. (Tr. 37) He \nacknowledged transporting the company EHD between his various company workspaces \n(he had three offices) but did not take it home or on travel. (Tr. 55-56, 59, 107-108) He was \nnot comfortable using a \u201cthumb drive\u201d for fear of losing it. (Tr. 60-61)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged viewing pornography on his personal computer beginning \nafter he and his second wife separated in 2011. He said he did so only at home. (Tr. 95, \n107) He testified that he did not use his personal EHD for that purpose. (Tr. 91-92). \nHowever, in AE A, his affidavit, Applicant stated that, \u201con my personal EHD, I stored \nimages that could be described as pornographic\u201d but not illegal. (AE A at \u00b6 55)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that he had transferred or \ndownloaded pornographic files from his personal computer to his personal EHD. He \ntestified, \u201cI don\u2019t specifically recall purposely doing it, but I ran backups. It was possible that \nthe scope of the backup included some of those files. . . . I can\u2019t say for certain that I did \n\n7 \n \nnot.\u201d (Tr. 61-62) \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible. I certainly didn\u2019t do it intentionally.\u201d (Tr. 96-97) He \nmaintained a \u201crobust firewall\u201d for virus and malware protection on his personal computer \nand believed it to be better than what the company used. (Tr. 62) Applicant acknowledged \nthat he could have accessed his personal files from the company tablet. (Tr. 65)  \n \nApplicant denied storing pornography on company assets: \u201cAll I can say is I did not \nput it there.\u201d (Tr. 95-96) He denied downloading and saving pornographic content on \ncompany assets during working hours. (Tr. 65) Applicant \u201cabsolutely\u201d denied using a \ncompany 1 computer, tablet, or EHD to view pornography. (Tr. 92) \u201cI did not put \npornography on [company 1\u2019s] owned tablet,\u201d or on any piece of company computing \nequipment. (Tr. 38, 47-48, 66) Applicant \u201cnever stored or accessed any inappropriate \npersonal images, videos, or documents\u201d on the company 1 tablet, the company EHD, or \nthrough any company technology. (AE A at \u00b6 59; Tr. 54-55)  \n \n \nApplicant did not recall e-mailing a 50-page movie list file from his work e-mail to his \npersonal e-mail (as noted in GE 4) and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019d do it. . . . It just doesn\u2019t \nmake sense to me.\u201d (Tr. 98-99) He testified that he would have no reason to put files such \nas \u201crecent downloads list 4/8/17\u201d or \u201cmovielist.txt\u201d on the company 1 tablet. (Tr. 67) He \nacknowledged, however that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that he had a movie list file or a recent \ndownload file concerning pornographic video or imagery on his personal computer, and \nthat he \u201cmay have\u201d maintained such a list on his personal computer, but did not recall \nspecifically. \u201cBecause certainly in 2017 I was living with my current wife. So there may well \nhave been files created at an earlier date. Say before June of 2016.\u201d (Tr. 67-68) He said he \ndid not remember creating such a document, and did not know why it would be on his work \ncomputer. (Tr. 99, 100) He acknowledged, however, that \u201cI might have created a \u2013 a file \nthat had an earlier date, or no date at all, but . . . only on my personal computer.\u201d (Tr. 100) \n \nApplicant did not recall having a membership to a specific adult website, or visiting \nthat specific website on his personal computer; that website was listed in GE 4 as having \nbeen discovered on his work computer. He said it was possible that the company\u2019s firewall \nlet some inappropriate e-mails through and he clicked on them by mistake, but deleted \nthem quickly. He recalled asking company IT to \u201cbeef up\u201d their e-mail firewall to stop such \ne-mails and access to such sites. (Tr. 69-70, 99) \n \nApplicant no longer uses a company EHD to transfer professional files between \nhome and work. He has a work laptop with a docking station at home that he uses instead. \nHe does not keep work or proprietary files on his personal computer. (Tr. 109-110) \n \nApplicant has not been in counseling or therapy with respect to pornography. (Tr. \n101) He continues to view pornography at home, including occasionally with his wife. (Tr. \n91, 100)  \n \nApplicant believes that other employees of company 1 had professional access to \nadministrative passwords, as he did, and \u201ceasily could access any [company 1] laptop or \ntablet and insert files onto that computing equipment.\u201d (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 69-71; Tr. 45-47) He \nbelieves that company 1 \u201ceither invented any \u2018evidence\u2019 it claimed that it had, or, while I \n\n8 \n \nwas away from my desk, someone connected that personal [EHD] to the tablet and \nuploaded pornographic images from that personally owned external drive to the tablet.\u201d (AE \nA at \u00b6 72) He believes that the real reason he was terminated was \u201cbecause I had called \nout several instances of unethical behavior and business practices in the company.\u201d (AE A \nat \u00b6 77) \n \nOn his September 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had been fired from \ncompany 1 for \u201calleged misuse of computer\u201d and \u201cI was told that pornographic files had \nbeen found on computer equipment in my possession.\u201d He also noted that this was shortly \nafter he had filed formal complaints about another employee for sexual harassment of \nfemale employees \u201cand lying to me about statements made by my staff.\u201d (GE 1 at 16, 17) \n  \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question on his SCA concerning \nunauthorized or unlawful use of information technology systems:  \n \nIn the last seven (7) years have you introduced, removed, or used \nhardware, software, or media in connection with any information technology \nsystem without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations or attempted any of the above? (GE 1 \nat 57) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s July 2019 background interview summary reflects that he was confronted \nwith apparent evidence, through an interview with a coworker, of the fact that an \ninvestigation of Applicant\u2019s laptop found pornography linked to Applicant\u2019s username, \npassword, and times and dates when he was logged in to the computer. (GE 2 at 2) The \ncoworker is not identified and no specifics are provided, let alone documented, in GE 2. In \nthe interview, Applicant denied any knowledge of the images. (GE 2 at 2) The remainder of \nApplicant\u2019s background interview largely concerns the sexual harassment allegations \nagainst Mr. C and Applicant\u2019s efforts to bring them to light; the May 2017 meeting with \ncompany officials that led to Applicant\u2019s termination; Applicant\u2019s assumption that Mr. C had \nsomething to do with transferring pornographic files onto Applicant\u2019s computer, and \nApplicant\u2019s discussion of his affair with S. (GE 2 at 2) \n \nWork and Character References \n \n \nJ testified both as a character witness and a fact witness for Applicant. He has been \na lawyer for almost 40 years, with about 17-18 years as general counsel for various \ndefense contractors. He was general counsel for company 1 from 2004 to February 2010, \nwhen Applicant was there, and has known him since then. (Tr. 124-126, 137) J is now in \nprivate practice. (He was also Applicant\u2019s original counsel in this case, and filed Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, though he did not testify in that capacity). (Tr. 142-143) \n \n \nAs an in-house general counsel, J handled many company investigations of \npornography on company computers. As such, J in his testimony took issue with company \n1\u2019s handing of the investigation in this case. He testified that such investigations are \ntypically discovered and investigated by HR and not by the legal department, though the \n\n9 \n \nlegal department would review the findings. (Tr. 127-128, 133-134) He also believes that \ncompany 1\u2019s legal department should have considered recusing itself from the investigation \nbecause the subject of the investigation was a senior company officer, as were others \npotentially involved. (Tr. 135) J also questioned the findings of the report, that there was \nevidence of pornography on work computers and any download of such materials during \nwork hours, to support the conclusions in GE 4 that such conduct was established. (Tr. \n135-136)  \n \n \nJ acknowledged, however, that if it were confirmed that pornography was found on \nan employee\u2019s work computer, it was best practice, even \u201cessential,\u201d to escort that \nemployee from the building immediately and place the employee on either paid or unpaid \nleave. (Tr. 128) He also said where there was reasonable basis to believe such employee \nmisconduct had taken place, \u201cit\u2019s not a high bar.\u201d (Tr. 128) \n \n \nJ described Applicant as a brilliant intellectual, with both an engineering background \nand a \u201ccommon sense\u201d notion of how a business runs. (Tr. 138-139) He said Applicant has \nimpeccable moral character, and an excellent sense of ethics, including as company 1\u2019s \nchief ethics officer. He is highly trustworthy and warrants being granted clearance eligibility. \n(Tr. 140-141, 145-146) Prior to his legal representation of Applicant, J was not aware of \nApplicant\u2019s sexual relationship with a subordinate employee. J has never put false \ninformation into an investigative report, nor would he ever do so. (Tr. 143-144) \n \n \nMr. M is a retired U.S. Navy captain and naval aviator, and a former employee of \ncompany 1. He was a company vice president who reported directly to Applicant. They had \ndaily interaction, and often travelled together for work. They worked together for several \nmonths, about five years ago. They had met previously when Mr. M ran another company. \n(Tr. 115-119)  \n \n \nMr. M was with Applicant the day Applicant was escorted out of the building. Mr. M \nheard days later that this happened because pornography had been found on a company \nlaptop, \u201cwhich struck me as really weird for a guy like [Applicant] who is smart as heck to \ndo something so stupid, but he was gone, so I just let it go at that.\u201d (Tr. 120) Mr. M left \ncompany 1 about two months after Applicant was terminated. (Tr. 120) \n \n \nMr. M regards Applicant as someone of the highest intellect, one of the \u201ctop five\u201d \npeople in terms of intellect that he has met in 40 years of professional and military \nexperience. He testified to Applicant\u2019s intelligence and \u201cflawless\u201d character, and attested \nthat his judgment and trustworthiness were \u201cbeyond reproach.\u201d He was not aware of \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with S at the time it was occurring (Mr. M also was not working \nthere at the time). (Tr. 117-119) Mr. M regards Applicant as a great American and an \nintellectual asset to the country. The fact that he may have had \u201csomething stupid on his \ncomputer is completely out of character.\u201d (Tr. 121-122) \n \n \nMr. M also testified that he was aware of a sexual harassment claim made against \nMr. C by a woman who worked for Mr. M. Mr. M directed that she should report the matter \nto HR. He also reported it to Applicant. (Tr. 116)  \n\n10 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant\u2019s employer conducted an investigation into his workplace \nconduct, including a romantic relationship with a subordinate employee in Applicant\u2019s chain \nof command, and the company\u2019s discovery of an extensive collection of pornography on \nApplicant\u2019s company computer systems.  \n\n11 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he had a sexual relationship with S for several months \nin 2012, and acknowledged he later had an interest in renewing the relationship and taking \nit public, though this did not come to pass. He testified that company officials knew of the \nrelationship in 2013, after it had ended. He said he was verbally reprimanded, but also \nsubsequently promoted. GE 4 indicates that the affair came to light in 2017 when the \nsubordinate employee raised concerns about working for Applicant, given their prior \ninvolvement. Both may well be true. While there was no company policy against the \nrelationship, it was included as part of the company\u2019s rationale for terminating him because \nhe did not report the relationship, and because it \u201cset the wrong example and tone at the \ntop\u201d and potentially exposed the company to \u201csignificant legal and reputational risk\u201d \nincluding possible claims of sexual harassment, a hostile workplace, and real or perceived \nfavoritism. The relationship and interaction with S is long over, he expressed regret for it, \nand he has since remarried and moved across the country.  \n \n \nThe allegations regarding the discovery of pornography on Applicant\u2019s company \ncomputers are more complex, largely since he not only does not admit it, but largely \nbelieves it to be fabricated in an attempt to get him fired (which worked, if that is what \nhappened). Applicant acknowledges that he was terminated, but steadfastly and repeatedly \ndenies that he knowingly and deliberately accessed, viewed, transferred, or stored any \npornographic materials, images, or videos on any company computer system. He said he \nwas not even aware of any inadvertent transfer, though he acknowledges that this is at \nleast possible, given his history of viewing and storing pornography at home on his \npersonal computer, since at least 2011, and because he transferred work files to and from \nhis personal computer and his work tablet through a personal EHD. He denied e-mailing a \nlist of pornographic movie files from his work e-mail account to his personal e-mail and \ndenied having any \u201crecent downloads\u201d file. But he acknowledged that he may have \nmaintained such a list on his personal computer. He denied being a member of a specific \npornographic website.  \n \nApplicant repeatedly surmised, without corroboration, that his disputes with the \ncompany in general, and with Mr. C in particular, led to his termination. He indicated, at \nleast in his affidavit, that others in the company had the knowledge and ability to install \npornography on his company computer tablet or EHD, and might even have actually done \nso in an attempt to set him up and get him fired. At hearing, he did not go quite that far, \nsaying only that he did not do so himself.  \n \nThere are several problems with this. First, Applicant readily acknowledges a long \nhistory of accessing, viewing and storing pornography on his personal computer at home. \nUnless others at the company either knew this and used that information to set him up \n(which is not established), or were trying to set him up and looked at his personal EHD and \ngot lucky by finding pornography (which is also not established), his acknowledged history \nof downloading pornography in his personal life at home makes it all the more likely that it \nwas Applicant who was responsible for the pornography found on his work computer \nsystems, regardless of how it got there. And it even makes it more likely than not that \nApplicant was viewing, accessing, and storing pornography at work and does not want to \nadmit it. And if Applicant is to be fully believed, his uncorroborated theory leaves one to \n\n12 \n \nwonder whether company officials had reason to know of his history of personal \npornography use and used it against him at work, or, if they did not know, how they \ndecided to put pornography on his work computers anyway. Further, if they went on \npornographic websites to set him up and used company computers to do it, they would \nhave had to violate their own company policy prohibiting accessing pornography.  \n \nIn addition, company 1\u2019s findings and conclusions in GE 4 must be given some \ndeference, as do the company\u2019s decisions about them. (ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 26. 2012)). The Appeal Board has held that such deference extends to an \nemployer\u2019s internal investigation. (ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan, 6, 2021 \n(citing ISCR 18-00496 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019)). I make this conclusion \nnotwithstanding the fact that GE 4 contains an unexplained error as to the sequence and \ntiming of events, in that Mr. F\u2019s initial discovery of pornography could not have taken place \non May 2, 2017 if it led him to ask IT to take action on May 1, 2017.  \n \nDespite this unexplained discrepancy, GE 4 establishes that, following an \ninvestigation, company 1 found an extensive collection of pornography on Applicant\u2019s work \ncomputers. Much of the collection was years old even in 2017 but some (such as the \n\u201cRecent downloads 4-8-17\u201d) suggest more recent activity. Given the extensive and quite \nspecific evidence addressed in GE 4, and the fact that I am required to give that evidence \nsome deference, that puts the burden on Applicant to disprove and mitigate it.  \n \nMoreover, the fact remains that Applicant was terminated for cause in May 2017 \nafter an extensive collection of pornography was found on his work computer systems \nfollowing a company investigation, as detailed in GE 4. As Applicant\u2019s own witness \nacknowledged, the company did not have a \u201chigh bar\u201d to clear to find grounds for his \nimmediate termination in the best interests of the company. Applicant has the burden of \nrebutting the record evidence supporting his termination for cause. \n \nI must weigh Applicant\u2019s credibility against the documentary evidence supporting the \nSOR allegations. Once security concerns are established, Applicant has the burdens of \nproduction and persuasion in establishing sufficient mitigation to overcome the security \nconcerns raised as to his clearance eligibility. With that backdrop, I now turn to analysis of \nthese findings under the three guidelines alleged. \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concerns for sexual conduct: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \n\n13 \n \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \n \nThe definition of sexual behavior under the Guideline D general concern \u201cincludes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written transmission.\u201d I find \nthat viewing, accessing, and storing pornography satisfies this definition.  \n \nI find that AG \u00b6 13(c) applies, as does AG \u00b6 13(d), both as to the public nature of the \nbehavior (on work computers) and since it reflects a lack of discretion or judgment. At the \nvery least, particularly given his education and professional position as chief technology \nofficer, Applicant exercised poor discretion and judgment in taking action (backing up work \nfiles he was working on at home, on a personal computer he used to access pornography), \nwhich conceivably led to the transfer of pornography onto his work computers. Applicant\u2019s \nsexual relationship with a subordinate is not alleged under Guideline D, so no disqualifying \nconditions apply to that circumstance.  \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 14, the following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.  \n \n \nApplicant has already felt the consequences of his behavior, in that he was \nterminated upon its discovery by his employer. His behavior no longer serves as a basis for \ncoercion, exploitation or duress, and AG \u00b6 14(c) applies. Applicant\u2019s use of pornography \n\n14 \n \nwas intended to be strictly private and discreet. AG \u00b6 14(d) also applies.  \n \n \nThe security concern with respect to Applicant\u2019s use of pornography is not the use \nitself, but rather the fact that an extensive collection of pornography was discovered on his \nwork computers, leading to his termination. That circumstance suggests poor judgment and \nfailure or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, particularly ones he had \nresponsibility to follow in his high-level position. The evidence (GE 4) indicates that many \nof the videos and images were from 2010 to 2012, though there is also reference to \u201crecent \ndownloads\u201d of pornography in April 2017, shortly before he was terminated. Even that \nevidence is now five years old. While his use was not infrequent, it also largely occurred \nduring and after a period of separation and divorce as his second marriage was ending. \nApplicant has now remarried and begun a new life. His interest in pornography itself, in his \npersonal life in more recent years, does not itself suggest a security concern. With respect \nto SOR \u00b6 1.a, AG \u00b6 14(b) applies.  \n \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \n \nThe security concerns about use of information technology are set forth in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining \nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into the question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. This includes any component, whether integrated into a larger \nsystem or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to enable or \nfacilitate these operations. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and   \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \n \nThe evidence of an extensive collection of pornography on Applicant\u2019s work \ncomputers, in violation of company policy establishes AG \u00b6 40(e), as well as AG \u00b6 40(f), as \nintroduction of prohibited media, since company 1 specifically prohibited browsing \npornographic sites and posting, sending, or acquiring sexually oriented material.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 41, the following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n15 \n \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; and  \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41(b) does not apply. The collection of pornography found on Applicant\u2019s \ncompany computers was extensive and therefore not minor. Applicant\u2019s misuse of an \ninformation technology system was serious because of the potential harm that can occur \nfrom accessing images from unapproved websites, such as pornographic websites. It can \nlead to inadvertent and unknowing insertion of a computer virus or malware on an \ninformation technology system. Applicant, as the chief strategy and technology officer for \ncompany 1 at the time, would know this better than many people.  \n \nEven if the presence of the pornography on his company computers systems were \ninadvertent, it stands to reason that it got there during a transfer (or transfers) of data \nbetween Applicant\u2019s home and work computers, through his personal EHD. In his position \nas chief technology officer, Applicant should have known that this might happen. He also \nmade no attempt to bring such information to the attention of appropriate personnel (of \nwhich, in his position, he was one). AG \u00b6 41(c) does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41(a) has some application due to the age of the conduct, and the fact that \nmuch of the use here took place, albeit over a long period, when Applicant was \nexperiencing marital instability. However, as noted above under Guideline D, the current \nsecurity concern is not so much the pornography use itself, but its extensive presence on \nApplicant\u2019s company computers, in violation of a policy that he not only knew about but \nhelped to draft, as the company\u2019s chief technology officer.  \n \nIn contrast to his relationship with S, Applicant does not acknowledge any \nwrongdoing with respect to the pornography found on his company computers. Indeed, \nmuch of his defense hinges on his belief that he was essentially set up by people at the \ncompany seeking to remove him. As noted, once security concerns are established, it is \nApplicant\u2019s burden to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate those concerns. In order to do \nthat here, he must overcome GE 4, and company 1\u2019s reliance on it in terminating him for \ncause. Further, in order for AG \u00b6 41(a) to fully apply, Applicant must show that the \ncircumstances that led to his termination were unusual, are unlikely to recur, and no longer \ncast doubt on his individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I cannot \nconclude that to be the case. Applicant tellingly does not acknowledge wrongdoing with \nrespect to his computer conduct in the face of credible, detailed evidence from company 1 \ndetailing their findings and conclusions that he engaged in the conduct. AG \u00b6 41(a) does \nnot fully apply.  \n \n \n\n16 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. . . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with S was not alleged under Guideline D, but is alleged \nunder Guideline E. While there was no company policy against the relationship, it was part \nof the company\u2019s rationale for terminating him because he did not report it and because it \n\u201cset the wrong example and tone at the top,\u201d potentially exposing the company to \n\u201csignificant legal and reputational risk\u201d including possible claims of sexual harassment, a \nhostile workplace, and real or perceived favoritism. Applicant\u2019s relationship with S, a \nsubordinate employee within his area of responsibility, satisfies AG \u00b6 16(2) (any disruptive \nor inappropriate behavior); AG \u00b6 16(e)(1); as well as the general security concern in AG \u00b6 \n15 (questionable judgment). \n \n \nThe evidence of pornography on Applicant\u2019s work computer systems, as cross-\nalleged under Guideline E, satisfies multiple disqualifying conditions, including AG \u00b6 \n\n17 \n \n16(d)(2) (any inappropriate behavior); AG \u00b616(d)(3) (pattern of rule violations); AG \n\u00b616(d)(4) (evidence of significant misuse of employer\u2019s time or resources); AG \u00b6 16(e)(1); \nas well as the general security concern in AG \u00b6 15 (questionable judgment).  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \n \nAs to AG \u00b617(f), Applicant argues that GE 4 was of questionable reliability, as in his \nview it was not created through best practices, is insufficiently supported, and contains an \nunexplained date discrepancy. However, as noted, I am required to give significant \ndeference to an employer\u2019s actions, and, as J noted in his testimony, when pornography is \nfound on an employer\u2019s work computer, it is not a \u201chigh bar\u201d to conclude that immediate \ntermination is appropriate. AG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply.  \n \n \nAs to the pornography, AG \u00b6 17(e) applies under the same rationale as AG \u00b6 14(c) \nabove under Guideline D. Applicant has already felt the consequences of his behavior, in \nthat he was terminated upon its discovery by his employer. His behavior no longer serves \nas a basis for coercion, exploitation or duress. As to the relationship with S, AG \u00b6 17(e) \nalso applies. The relationship is long over, he expressed regret for it, and he has since \nremarried and moved across the country.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) can be addressed together. As discussed, I am required to \ngive deference to the employer\u2019s actions and rationale for terminating Applicant, and do so. \nOnce a security concern is established, it is Applicant\u2019s burden of production and \npersuasion to establish mitigation.  \n \n \nTo overcome GE 4 requires me to rely heavily on Applicant\u2019s credibility, and to lend \nsignificant credence to his version of events. To believe that, I have to accept not only that \nhis employer wanted to terminate him but that they manufactured evidence of pornography \non his company computers as grounds by which to do so. Such evidence is \nuncorroborated. Applicant\u2019s testimony, and that of his witnesses, is insufficient in this \n\n18 \n \nregard to overcome the company\u2019s conclusions. In short, I find it very difficult to believe that \ncompany 1 manufactured evidence against Applicant, and in doing so, exploited a vice that \nApplicant happened to engage in privately. It is far more likely that, the company\u2019s report is \naccurate in many particulars \u2013 none of which Applicant has admitted. In short, I do not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations credible, when balanced against the Government\u2019s evidence, \nparticularly when he has a long history of viewing pornography in his private life. \n \n \nAs noted, the events in this case are now several years old. However, what is most \nconcerning here is that Applicant has not acknowledged any wrongdoing with respect to \nthe pornography allegation, in the face of quite strong evidence from company 1. This \nweighs against its mitigation, because his explanations are speculative, not sufficiently \ncorroborated, and not credible. His position continues to cast doubt on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. I therefore cannot conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) fully \napply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analyses under Guidelines D, M and E are incorporated \nin my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under \nthose guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe security concern at this point is not the pornography. The security concern here \nis Applicant\u2019s judgment, his violation of company policy, and the fact that, in the face of \nstrong evidence of his misconduct, his failure to acknowledge wrongdoing with respect to \nthe pornography.  \n \nApplicant is a highly educated, very intelligent professional, working at a senior level \nin a technical field. He has a long career in the defense industry with a clearance, as \nevidenced not only by his own evidence and testimony but also his witnesses. I gave due \nconsideration to this evidence in mitigation and under the whole-person concept. \n \nAs noted, it is Applicant\u2019s burden to overcome the security concerns once \nestablished. The conduct at issue here is quite dated, as it is now about five years old. But \nI am troubled most by Applicant\u2019s attempts to avoid blame for his conduct, and to seek to \nattach blame to others, in a highly speculative and self-serving manner, with insufficient \ncorroborating evidence. His position is not credible and, in the face of reasonable, \nsubstantial, and specific evidence that he engaged in the conduct. this makes it difficult to \nconclude that circumstances have changed, or that Applicant would appropriately accept \nblame for future actions, rather than attempting to shift it to others, in a future situation of \nsecurity significance.  \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is well settled that once a \n\n19 \n \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted above, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 3.b:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nBraden M.

Subparagraph 1.a \nis a delinquent car note. The balance of the account is approximately $27,000, and \nApplicant, as of the date of the SOR, was one month behind on the monthly payments of \n$730. (Answer at 1) SOR subparagraph 1.b is a credit card account totaling $16,148. \nApplicant began using this credit card to make cash advances when he was unemployed. \nThe debt in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b is held by the same creditor. \nApplicant is no longer behind on the delinquent car note alleged in subparagraph 1.a \nand it is not in default.

Applicant \nwas unaware of this debt. Specifically, after registering for a class with the university, he \ndropped it and did not think he would owe the tuition for the entire semester. (Tr. 20) After \nthe hearing, Applicant arranged a payment plan. Under the plan he was make $100 \npayments, beginning December 20, 2021. (AE E) He submitted AE E on January 7, 2022, \nbut provided no proof that he had made the first payment. Applicant had earlier promised \nto make payment arrangements with this creditor, in response to interrogatories of June \n2020. Applicant noted that he was going to contact the creditor.

(Tr. 20) He has been attempting to contact the creditor, but has thus far \nbeen unsuccessful. (Tr. 20) It remains unresolved. \nSOR subparagraph 1.e totals $1,032. After the hearing, Applicant contacted the \ncreditor and negotiated an agreement to satisfy the debt in the reduced amount of $671, \npayable by February 14, 2022. (Tr. 23; AE C) \nSOR subparagraph 1.f, totaling $502, is an allegedly delinquent phone bill. Applicant \ndisputes this bill. (Tr. 24) He provided no evidence substantiating the basis of the dispute. \nSOR subparagraph 1.g, totaling $81, is a delinquent satellite television bill. Before \nthe beginning of the investigative process, Applicant was unaware of this debt. (Answer at \n2) Applicant satisfied this bill in December 2021. (AE D) \nApplicant earns an annual salary ranging from $56,000 to $65,000, depending on \nhow much overtime he works. (Tr. 16) He and his wife have approximately $4,000 \ndeposited in a joint checking account. (Tr. 40) Applicant testified that he maintains a \nbudget. (Tr. 22) He has approximately $1,000 of monthly discretionary income after bills \nare paid. (Tr. 22) He did not provide a copy of his budget. In December 2020, Applicant \nretained a credit repair agency to help him with his finances. (AE A; Tr. 42) He did not \nelaborate about the services they have provided since he hired them. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2018. \nSubparagraph 2.a alleges that he falsified his SCA by failing to list his delinquent debts in \nresponse to Section 26, which reads as follows: \nOther than previously listed, have any of the following happened? In the past \nseven years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? In the \npast seven years, you had any account or credit card suspended, charged \noff, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had been making car payments on the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a, \nbut was running one month behind. Subparagraph 1.b had been charged off when \nApplicant completed the SCA. Applicant was unaware that he owed the debts listed in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.c and 1.g. He denied SOR subparagraph 1.f. Although the debts listed in \nsubparagraphs 1.d through 1.f were delinquent when Applicant completed the security \nclearance application, there is no record evidence that they had been turned over to \ncollection, or charged off, and the record evidence is unclear as to whether they were more \nthan 180 days overdue when Applicant completed the SCA. (GE 3 at 2-4) \nApplicant contends that he did not include the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a \nand 1.b because he electronically submitted an earlier SCA without double checking the \nresponses. (Tr. 47) Applicant had an opportunity to correct these discrepancies in 2018 \nwhen an investigative agent interviewed him and asked him whether he had ever been \nmore than 180 days late on debt payment in the past seven years. (Answer at 2) Applicant \nfailed to do so until confronted. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s incurrence of delinquent debts triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after a three-month period of unemployment in 2018. \nSince then, he has caught up on the car payment, alleged in subparagraph 1.a and he has \npaid the delinquent satellite television bill, alleged in subparagraph 1.g. I resolve these \nsubparagraphs in his favor. \nIn addition to satisfying or getting current on the debts, as discussed in the previous \nparagraph, Applicant has retained a credit repair agency to help him manage his finances, \nand he has negotiated payment plans with the creditors of the debts set forth in \nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, and negotiated a settlement for the debt alleged subparagraph \n1.e. Conversely, he did not make any plans to resolve these debts until approximately ten \nmonths after the issuance of the SOR and one week after the hearing. Under these \ncircumstances, 20(a) does not apply. Moreover, payments were supposed to begin on \nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c by the end of December 2022. Applicant submitted the \nagreements in January 2022, but provided no evidence that he made the first payments, as \nset forth in the settlement agreements. Under these circumstances, the cause of \nApplicant\u2019s debts relates to an event beyond his control, but he did not establish that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Only the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nGiven that Applicant did not provide proof that he initiated the payment plans for the \ndebts set forth in subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, any presumption that he paid the debt \nalleged in subparagraph 1.e in February 2022, as promised, is speculative. Furthermore, \nhe failed to elaborate upon, or document the services that the credit repair agency has \nbeen providing to him. Consequently, the hiring of credit repair agency triggers the first \nprong of AG \u00b6 20(c), but the second prong with respect to there being clear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or under control is inapplicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs for AG \u00b6 20(d), Applicant initiated a good-faith payment plan to satisfy his \ndelinquent debt; however, he provided no evidence that he made the first scheduled \npayments under the arranged payment plans. Consequently, I cannot conclude that he is \nadhering to the plans. AG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially applicable. \nApplicant disputed the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, but did not provide any \nevidence substantiating the basis of his contention. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nIn conclusion, Applicant deserves credit for getting caught up on his car payment, \nalleged in subparagraph 1.a. He has taken additional steps such as retaining a credit repair \nagency and negotiating settlements with creditors. However, he provided no proof that he \nmade the first payments under the settlement agreements, and the basis of dispute for one \nof the SOR debs is unsubstantiated. Under these circumstances, he has not met his \nburden of proving that the debts are under control or that they will be resolved, as \npromised. Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack kof candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose delinquent debts in response to Section 26 of his 2018 \nSCA raises the question of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. It is unclear from the record \nwhether Applicant was behind on his car note (subparagraph 1.a) when he completed his \nSCA. Consequently, I cannot conclude that he falsified the SCA when he did not include it \nin response to Section 26. \nApplicant believed in good faith that he did not owe any money for the semester \nwhen he withdrew from college. Under these circumstances, he did not falsify his SCA \nwhen he did not include the delinquent loan alleged in subparagraph 1.c. Although the \ndebts listed in subparagraphs 1.d through 1.f were delinquent when Applicant completed \nthe security clearance application, there is no record evidence that they had been turned \nover to collection, or charged off, and the record evidence is unclear as to whether they \nwere more than 180 days overdue when Applicant completed the SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.b is \nmore problematic. Assuming for the sake of argument that his explanation that it was a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncareless oversight that stemmed from turning in a previously-completed SCA without \nupdating it, he had an opportunity to correct the oversight when he met with an \ninvestigative agent a few months later, and did not disclose it until confronted. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s omission of the delinquent car note, as \nalleged in subparagraph 1.b, and his later failure to disclose it to an agent triggers the \nunmitigated application of AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation; or concealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official competent medical or mental health professional \ninvolved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative.\u201d In sum, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law no longer lives in Nigeria and is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s relationship with her does not generate \na foreign influence security concern. I resolve subparagraph 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law remains a Nigerian citizen and resident. Given \nNigeria\u2019s troubled history of terrorism, Applicant\u2019s contact with his father-in-law could create \n\u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 7(a)) \nApplicant\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law are typically two to three minutes in \nlength, once every three to four weeks, and are limited to exchanging pleasantries. Under \nthese circumstances, the mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d applies. Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nGiven the length of time that elapsed before Applicant began attempting to resolve \nhis debts, and his intentional omission of relevant financial information during the \ninvestigative process, I conclude that Applicant did not carry the burden of establishing that \nhe is not a security risk. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 55 years old and has married and divorced twice. His most recent divorce was in 2015. He has no children. He served in the U.S. Navy for twenty years (1992 to 2012) and received an Honorable discharge. He graduated from high school in 1986 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014.

Paragraph 1 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct In paragraph 1 of the SOR, the Government listed three allegations under Guideline E and asserted a fourth allegation in the Amendment. The first allegation is that Applicant\u2019s employment with Company A was involuntarily terminated in 2016 for violating company policy, which prohibited dating active duty military personnel (SOR 1.a). In his Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation. The second is that his employment with Company B was involuntarily terminated in October 2017 for threatening gun violence against a co-worker, who worked for Company C (SOR 1.b). He admitted this allegation though he explained that no guns were involved.

This action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nafter June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on November 16, 2021, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On January 26, 2022, Department \nCounsel amended the SOR to add new allegations under the existing guidelines. She \nwas prepared to proceed on the same date. Applicant did not respond to the Amendment \nto the Statement of Reasons (Amendment). The case was assigned to me on February \n8, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing on April 25, 2022. The case was heard as scheduled on May 23, \n2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel also presented for administrative notice \npurposes a copy of a criminal statute of State 1, which I marked as AN I. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. He had attached \ntwo documents to his Answer, which I marked as AE D through E. All of Applicant\u2019s \nexhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 1, 2022. (Tr. at 13-19, 21-23, 49-50.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 55 years old and has married and divorced twice. His most recent \ndivorce was in 2015. He has no children. He served in the U.S. Navy for twenty years \n(1992 to 2012) and received an Honorable discharge. He graduated from high school in \n1986 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. At the time of the hearing, Applicant was \nattending classes to earn a certification. He works for a Defense Department contractor \nas a mechanic. He is a first-time applicant seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nrelation to his employment. (Tr. at 24-25, 28; GE 1 at 7, 21-22, 24-25, 28; AE C.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nIn paragraph 1 of the SOR, the Government listed three allegations under \nGuideline E and asserted a fourth allegation in the Amendment. The first allegation is that \nApplicant\u2019s employment with Company A was involuntarily terminated in 2016 for violating \ncompany policy, which prohibited dating active duty military personnel (SOR 1.a). In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this allegation. The second is that his employment with \nCompany B was involuntarily terminated in October 2017 for threatening gun violence \nagainst a co-worker, who worked for Company C (SOR 1.b). He admitted this allegation \nthough he explained that no guns were involved. The third is that in November 2017 \nCompany C obtained a court restraining order prohibiting Applicant from having any \ncontact with employees of Company C for three years (SOR 1.c). In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted this allegation. In the Amendment the Government alleged that Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his response to a question in Section 22 about his criminal record by \nfailing to disclose the November 2017 criminal charges against Applicant arising out of \nthe workplace threat incident alleged in SOR 1.b (SOR 1.d). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nThe details of the personal conduct issues raised in the SOR are the following: \n1.a Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that his employment with Company A was \nterminated in May 2016 because he had a relationship with an active duty military member \nworking in the same command as Applicant, which was against the employer\u2019s policy. \nApplicant was working on a military base as a civilian. He testified that he was unaware \nof such a policy at that time. The Commanding Officer of the base asked his employer to \nterminate Applicant for his actions. Applicant testified that the woman involved was \ndivorced. He claimed at the hearing that he only \u201csaw her a couple of times.\u201d He provided \ninconsistent information about her marital status and the length and nature of their \nrelationship in his background interview. (Tr. at 29-31; GE 1 at 18-19; GE 2 at 9-10.)    \n1.b Applicant was fired from his next job in October 2017. He testified that a co-\nworker had loudly made an insulting sexual comment about Applicant\u2019s mother in an open \nspace of their workplace in front of others, including his supervisor and a U.S. \nGovernment client. Applicant was unable to explain why the co-worker would publicly \ninsult him in that way. Applicant reacted angrily and made a threatening comment about \na gun and walked off the job, which was located on a military base where a third \ncontractor, Company C, operated. As he was leaving, he made a pointed-finger hand \ngesture at the employee of Company C who insulted him as though he was firing a gun. \nHe admitted at the hearing that he also made a comment suggesting that he was going \nto get his guns. He explained further that he responded to the co-worker by saying \u201cI\u2019d \nlike to go get a gun and go shooting.\u201d He testified, however, that he does not own any \nguns. He was later questioned by law enforcement about pictures on his social media \npage in which he was depicted with guns. He insisted that the people who heard his \ncomments took them \u201cthe wrong way.\u201d He was terminated the same day. (Tr. at 31-36, \n56-58; GE 1 at 17-18.) \n1.c On October 31, 2017, Company C brought a civil lawsuit against Applicant \nseeking a restraining order. The lawsuit was based upon the comments Applicant made \nto the employees of Company C earlier that month. Applicant hired an attorney and \nattended the hearing in November 2017. Two witnesses to the incident appeared in court \nand Company C took the position that its employees were at risk of being harmed by \nApplicant. The court issued a three-year restraining order prohibiting Applicant from \nhaving contact with Company C and four of its employees. He was also ordered to sell \nany firearm he possessed to a licensed gun dealer or to turn it or them into the police \nwithin 24 hours. The restraining order expired in November 2020. Applicant testified in \nthe DOHA proceeding that he did not own any firearms at the time of the workplace \nincident or at the time of the court hearing. After the court hearing, Applicant was required \nto undergo a mental evaluation at a military hospital. He was accompanied by base police \nand local city police officers, indicating that a criminal investigation into the incident was \nongoing. As discussed below, a criminal charge was filed in court against Applicant on \nNovember 28, 2017.

The questions asked if \nhe had \u201cbeen issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal \nproceeding against [him]\u201d in the prior seven years and if he had been \u201ccharged, convicted, \nor sentenced of a crime in any court\u201d in the past seven years. The Government alleged \nthat Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate. Applicant did not respond to this allegation in \nthe Government\u2019s Amendment. As a result, I regard his non-response as a denial. (SOR \n1.d; GE 1 at 33.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant at first claimed he misunderstood the e-QIP questions. \nOn further examination, he testified that he was not aware of the warrant or the criminal \ncharge until he received the SOR. There is no evidence in the record to contradict his \ntestimony. In fact, the investigator\u2019s summary of Applicant\u2019s multiple interviews in 2019 \n(GE 2) makes no mention of any criminal citation or charge. Applicant is reported to have \ndiscussed at length during the interview the civil restraining order court proceeding. This \nexhibit suggests that even the interviewer was unaware of the pending criminal \nproceeding because he or she asked no questions about it. (Tr. at 37-48; GE 2 at 2-4.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleged in this single allegation that in November 2017 Applicant \nwas charged with the offense of Criminal Threat of Death or Great Bodily Injury and then \nfailed to appear in court as required. The SOR further alleged that the warrant remained \noutstanding as of the date of the SOR, i.e., September 1, 2020 (SOR 2.a). In his Answer, \nhe admitted this allegation, but asserted that the warrant was subsequently resolved. The \ndetails are as follows: \n2.a After Applicant\u2019s October 2017 verbal altercation with a co-worker and his \ntermination from Company B, the police interviewed Applicant at his residential facility. \nAs noted, he was taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation in November 2017. On \nNovember 28, 2017, a criminal charge was filed in court against Applicant. He was \ncharged with the crime of Criminal Threat of Death or Great Bodily Injury. On March 15, \n2018, Applicant failed to appear in court to respond to the charge and an arrest warrant \nwas issued on March 20, 2018. His bail was set at $15,000. He testified that he was never \nadvised that he had to appear in court. He clarified his testimony by stating that he was \nnever advised of the charge against him and he was never given a summons to appear \nin court on a criminal charge. He claimed that he first learned about the warrant when he \nreceived the SOR. He then hired an attorney, paid his bail, and received a court date. He \nprovided with his Answer a court document (AE D) that reflects that his attorney appeared \nin court on June 3, 2021, over three years after the original court date. The exhibit also \nprovides that the charge filed against Applicant was as stated above. The State 1 criminal \nstatute and related information provided by the Government for administrative notice \npurposes established that this charge was a misdemeanor. AE D further evidences that \nhe pled guilty to a different charge. Applicant testified that he pled guilty to Breach of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPeace. He paid a fine of $149 on June 16, 2021. The arrest warrant was resolved with \nhis guilty plea. He testified that he has had no subsequent issues with the police. (Tr. at \n37-47; GE 5 at 2-4; AN I at 1-2; AE D.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentifies six past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $35,500 \n(SOR 3.a through 3.f). In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations and \nprovided some additional information. The Government alleged two additional debts in \nthe Amendment (SOR 3.g and 3.h) totaling an additional amount of about $21,000. The \nexistence and amounts of all eight debts are supported by the Government\u2019s credit \nreports in the record, dated January 20, 2022; April 23, 2020; and June 8, 2019. The \ncurrent status of each of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is the following: \n3.a Auto loan account charged off in the approximate amount of $20,174. \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed after he stopped paying on the auto loan due to lack \nof income. After his discharge from the Navy in 2012, Applicant was attending college \nclasses full time and was living off his military pension, monthly VA disability payments, \nand the GI Bill payments. He was homeless for a long period and was going through a \ndivorce. The debt was charged off in 2014. Applicant has made no efforts to repay the \ndebt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 59-62; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4.) \n3.b Internet/TV account charged off in the approximate amount of $1,530. \nThis debt arose for cable services provided to a house Applicant shared with a girlfriend \n(Woman A) and her two children. He was deployed for three months as a civilian and sent \nWoman A money every month to pay the rent and the cable bill. She used the money for \nother purposes and left the bill for Applicant to pay, even though her name was on the \naccount. She vacated the rental property and took the cable equipment. The debt was \ncharged off in 2014. Applicant has made no effort to repay the debt. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. at 62-66; GE 8 at 2.) \n3.c Rental account in collection in the approximate amount of $11,537. \nApplicant was evicted after Woman A had vacated the property they shared. He was \nunsure of the timing of the eviction. He explained that he and Woman A had a \u201cbad falling \nout\u201d and he could not afford to pay the past-due rent. Applicant did not believe he should \nhave to pay this entire bill for rent since Woman A had also signed the lease. He has \nmade no payments on the debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 64-69; GE 8 at 7.) \n3.d Cellphone account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,664. \nApplicant shared this account with Woman A. She purchased phones for her children. He \ndid not want to pay a bill that she should have paid.

Applicant was unable to pay it at that time. In \nFebruary 2021, he paid the bill. He attached proof of payment to his Answer. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. at 71-7, 742; GE 7 at 1; GE 8 at 8; AE E.) \n3.f Medical account in collection in the approximate amount of $260. This bill \nfor ambulance services arose in 2014 or 2015. Applicant was unable to pay it at that time. \nIn February 2021, he paid the bill. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 73; GE 8 at 8.) \n3.g Loan account charged off in the approximate amount of $11,799. In April \n2021 Applicant was attempting to purchase a house and borrowed funds to buy furniture \nfor the house. He stopped repaying the loan and is attempting to negotiate a settlement. \nThis debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 73-77; GE 6 at 4.) \n3.h Loan account charged off in the approximate amount of $9,548. Applicant \ntook out this personal loan in 2021 to pay for vehicle repairs. He testified that he is trying \nto contact the creditor to make payment arrangements, but he has not yet been \nsuccessful. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 77-80; GE 6 at 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nApplicant has twice been terminated from his employment. The first time in 2016 \nwas for violating company policy (SOR 1.a), which establishes AG 16(d)(1). The second \ntime in October 2017 was for making criminal threats, which resulted in both his \nimmediate termination and criminal charges. AG 16(c) applies to SOR 1.b. SOR 1.c does \nnot allege any separate personal conduct by Applicant. Instead, it alleges the actions \ntaken by Company C to protect its employees and its workplace. That allegation is not \ncognizable under Guideline E. Also, the record evidence does not establish that the 2017 \ncriminal summons or citation and later the warrant for failure to appear was ever served \non Applicant. In the absence of evidence that Applicant received actual notice of the \ncriminal summons and charge, the Government\u2019s evidence does not support the \napplication of AG 16(a), i.e., that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the summons \nand charge in his 2019 e-QIP (SOR 1.d). \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the established \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG 17(c) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s conduct is not minor or infrequent and his \nactions did not occur under any unique circumstances or very long ago.

Also, his threatening \nbehavior in the workplace was totally inappropriate. Disagreements among co-workers \nare common and need to be addressed through proper channels. Threatening violence \nin response to an insult reveals a serious lack of judgment, which may be repeated under \nother \ncircumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s \nmisconduct \ncasts \ndoubt \non \nhis \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAs discussed, the Government provided no evidence that the law enforcement \nauthorities actually served Applicant with a summons or citation to appear in court on the \nthreat charge. Accordingly, there is no evidence that Applicant knowingly failed to appear \nat his court date that gave rise to the issuance of an arrest warrant. Applicant denies that \nhe was aware of either the initial court date or the warrant. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 31(a) has \nnot been established because the one criminal offense for which Applicant was charged \ndoes not constitute a pattern of minor offenses. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 31(b). This evidence shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. AG \u00b6 32 sets \nforth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following two mitigating conditions \nhave possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions have been sufficiently established to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s threatening conduct in a Government \nworkplace. His employer took Applicant\u2019s threat so seriously that it fired him the same \nday. Company C went to court to obtain a restraining order to prevent the potential for \nviolence in its workplace presented by Applicant\u2019s threat. Some time has passed since \nthe criminal conduct, but not enough time has passed to convincingly permit a conclusion \nthat Applicant will not lose his temper again in the workplace or elsewhere and engage in \ncriminal behavior. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nMoreover, Applicant presented little evidence of his rehabilitation. In fact, he does not \neven concede that he did anything wrong. He believes that others simply took his \nstatements \u201cthe wrong way.\u201d There can be no successful rehabilitation if the Applicant \ndoes not even acknowledge the criminal behavior.   \nParagraph 3 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed approximately $57,000 for \neight past-due debts, including one automobile repossession, substantial past-due rent, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand two recent unpaid personal loans. These facts establish the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has both substantial old and recent debts. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that future debts will be avoided. Applicant\u2019s history of \nmany years of unpaid and unresolved financial indebtedness casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Several of Applicant\u2019s debts arose when he had \nlimited income following his retirement from the Navy. He was attending college classes \nfull time and was unable to meet all of his financial obligations while he was unemployed. \nHe experienced homelessness and a divorce. Once he became employed, his actions \nwere not responsible under the circumstances. He made no effort to try to repay his \ndelinquent debts, with the exception of two minor debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) has limited application. Applicant has only repaid two of the SOR debts. \nBoth payments were made after he received the SOR. Moreover, he has incurred two \nnew significant debts since receiving the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) also has limited application. Applicant has claimed that he has disputed \nsome of the SOR debts, but he provided no documentary evidence to substantiate that \nhe has a reasonable the basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debts. The mere fact that \nan old debt has been removed from a credit report is not evidence that it has been \nsuccessfully disputed. Debts are removed from credit reports for several possible reasons \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the fact that a debt is more than seven years old and has been deleted is not evidence \nthat the debt has been resolved in a responsible manner, such as negotiation and \npayment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe concerns under any of the three guidelines set forth in the SOR. The evidence under \nany one of the guidelines would alone be disqualifying. Taken together, the record \nevidence presents an applicant who has significant flaws in his judgment and cannot be \nconsidered to be reliable and trustworthy. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.e and 3.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.g and 3.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He worked \nfrom February 2017 to October 2017; unemployed December 2015 to February 2017, \nand was employed from June 2005 to December 2015. He left this job to go to college. \nHe attended college from May 2015 to May 2018. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he \nindicated he was currently employed. The dates of his employment are unknown. (Item \n2) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts. In December 2018, Applicant was \ninterviewed by a government investigator. He was confronted with the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($28,862), which he acknowledged. The account was opened during his first \nmarriage. Applicant assumed payments on a trailer from the owners. He stopped making \nthe payments after his wife left. He did not recall the amount of the delinquency. He told \nthe investigator that he made payments of $50 and one of the payments was returned so \nhe assumed the matter was settled. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he said that he \nattempted to contact the creditor, but was unable to locate the creditor. He also said that \nthe debt is over 10 years old and therefore the statute of limitations has run. (Items 2,6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview Applicant acknowledged the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($747) and 1.c ($114). He said he did not know that he owed \nmoney on the accounts. He was going to research them and intended on resolving them \nin 2019. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($908), he told the investigator that he did not \nknow what the debt was for or if it belonged to him, but he would contact the government \ninvestigator later to confirm the information. (item 6) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was interviewed again by the government investigator. \nHe said the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c became delinquent because he did not have the \nmoney to pay them. He anticipated resolving the debts by the end of 2019.

(Item 6) \nApplicant\u2019s December 2018 credit report reflects the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b. and 1.c as charged off. The account in SOR \u00b6 1.d is listed as a voluntary \nsurrender with a delinquent balance owed of $28,862. Applicant\u2019s November 2021 credit \nreport does not reflect the alleged debts. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nIn response to Government interrogatories from January 2020, Applicant stated \nthat he attempted to resolve the SOR debts, but received no response from his inquires \nand that the debts no longer appear on his credit report. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c \nand stated that he was unable to confirm their status with the creditor and the three \naccounts \u201care nearly 10 years old and therefore exceed the statute of limitations.\u201d (Item \n2) \nApplicant further stated in his SOR answer that he has turned his life around. He \nsettled multiple outstanding debts, including five credit card debts, student loans, and a \ndebt for television services. He said he completed years of college and obtained a security \ncertificate that allowed him to obtain better job opportunities, which has allowed him to \nlive within his means. He is trusted with sensitive information and maintains a clean \nlifestyle. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has four delinquent debts that began accumulating more than ten years \nago that he was unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant acknowledged to the government investigator in 2018, all of the debts \nalleged in the SOR. He indicated he was unable to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and \n1.c because he did not have the money. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d he said he \nmade $50 payments, one was returned, so he assumed the debt was resolved. His lack \nof initiative to contact the creditor to verify the status of the debt is irresponsible. Applicant \nprovided no documentary evidence to show he has done anything to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. He says he made inquiries about the accounts, but received no \nresponse.

There is no evidence of financial counseling or a good-\nfaith effort to pay the creditors or resolve the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant stated he did not have the money to pay the debts. He had periods of \nunemployment, which may have been beyond his control, but he offered no evidence that \nhe took meaningful action to resolve the debts. AG 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debts for 10 years does not create a \nmitigation windfall. Under the circumstances, I cannot find that his behavior occurred \nunder unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThe Appeal Board provides a summary regarding \u201cnon-collectable\u201d debts: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitations, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in making a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan 19, 2011) \nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the statute of limitations to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts is misguided. Insufficient evidence was provided, and he \nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DOHA received the \nDCS VTC hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 8, 2021. (Tr. at 28-13, 52-53) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations in her Answer. She is 40 years \nold, single, and has a minor child. As of the date of the DCS VTC hearing, she \ncohabitated with her fianc\u00e9 of three years since 2010. (Answer; Tr. at 13-15, 23; GE 1; \nAE L) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1999. She earned an associate\u2019s degree \nin 2001, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003, and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. As of the date of \nthe hearing, she worked as an engineer for her employer, a DOD contractor, since \n2010. She was first granted access to sensitive information in 2009. (Tr. at 5-6, 15-16, \n51-52; GE 1; AE D, E, F) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to pay her federal income taxes, as \nrequired, for tax years (TY) 2012 through 2018, and she owed the U.S. Government \napproximately $17,685 in unpaid taxes for those tax years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b). The SOR \nallegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, her December \n2018 security clearance application (SCA), her adopted 2019 background interviews, \nand her July 2020 response to interrogatories. (Tr. at 16-19; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant attributed her failure to pay her federal income taxes for TY 2012 \nthrough 2018 to her inability to pay due to minimal income. After she and her fianc\u00e9 \nrelocated in 2010, her fianc\u00e9 had difficulty finding employment, and she was the primary \nbreadwinner. She prioritized their basic living expenses, to include child care. Her fianc\u00e9 \nworked for many years in a part time or temporary capacity, and he obtained full-time \nemployment in approximately 2017. (Tr. at 16-32, 45-46; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant indicated in her April 2019 background interview that she established \nan installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2013 of $190 \nmonthly, to resolve her outstanding taxes. In her July 2020 response to interrogatories, \nshe provided documentation reflecting that she made the following payments to the IRS \nfor her outstanding taxes: (1) four payments totaling $546 between May 2018 and July \n2020 for TY 2012; (2) a payment of $149 in May 2018 for TY 2018; and (3) a payment \nof $149 in June 2020 for TY 2020. In 2020, the IRS revised her installment agreement \nto $262 monthly. Due to financial assistance from her mother, in part, she made \nadditional payments to the IRS of approximately $3,612 and $1,296 toward TY 2012 \nand 2013 in November 2020, respectively, and $1,000 and $764 in March 2021 toward \nTY 2013 and 2018, respectively.

She provided documentation reflecting that as of September \n2021, she owed the IRS a total of $11,537, and she was current on her monthly \npayments. (Tr. at 16-32, 38-44, 48, 51-52; GE 1, 2; AE A, B, C, G, H, M, N) \nApplicant testified that she received financial counseling online in approximately \n2020. She also intends to consult with a tax advisor. She provided a copy of her budget, \nreflecting a total monthly household income of $6,700 and a monthly net remainder of \napproximately $1,481, which provides her with sufficient disposable income to meet her \nfinancial obligations. Her annual performance reviews reflect that her employer rated \nher performance as \u201c[c]onsistently meets expectations\u201d from 2017 to 2019 and \u201cstrong \nperformance\u201d in 2020, and her employer gave her a star award in appreciation of her \nefforts on a project in April 2021. A co-worker of over 10 years described Applicant as \nreliable, professional, and trustworthy. (Tr. at 23, 32-38, 41, 46-51; GE 2; AE D, I, J, K, \nN) \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to pay her federal income taxes from TY 2012 through 2018. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as disqualifying \nconditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Before she received the SOR, she established an installment \nagreement with the IRS in approximately 2013, and she made payments totaling $844 \ntoward her outstanding taxes for TY 2012, 2018, and 2020 between May 2018 and June \n2020. Since the IRS revised her installment agreement in 2020, Applicant has kept \ncurrent on her monthly payments of $262, and she has also made several additional \npayments toward her outstanding taxes. She has paid her outstanding taxes for TY \n2012 and 2013. As of September 2021, she owed the IRS a total of $11,537. She \nreceived financial counseling in 2020, and intends to consult with a tax advisor. Her \nmonthly household net remainder provides her with sufficient disposable income to \ncontinue to resolve her outstanding taxes and meet her financial obligations. I find that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d) and 20(g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

The context of the hospitalization was \nmedication noncompliance. He was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Disorganized Type. \nIn 2012, Applicant was 18 years old and a freshman in college. (Tr. 36) He was \nreceiving mental-health treatment. (Tr. 92) His grades for the first semester were As and \nBs.

(Tr. 36, 94) He told his mental-health \nprovider that he was in fact taking his medications. (Tr. 48) He rationalized that he did \nnot like the stigma of having a mental-health disorder; he did not like the side effects of \nthe medication; and he believed he would be fine without the medication.

He began displaying symptoms of psychosis, including homicidal \nideations. He was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, disorganized, chronic. \nAfter Applicant received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016, he was doing well \nprofessionally, and he was stable. (Tr. 39) He was living with his parents. (Tr. 96) His \nprimary side effects from his medication were some drowsiness and a little weight gain. \n(Tr. 52-53) The main reason he wanted to stop taking the medication was because of the \nstigma associated with his mental-health disorder. (Tr. 54) His treating physician \nrecommended no change in his medication; however, Applicant wanted to see whether \nthe medication was necessary. (Tr. 39) He gradually reduced his medication level until \nhe had completely stopped taking his medication. (Tr. 39) The previous time he stopped \ntaking his medication abruptly, and he believed if he gradually tapered off his medication, \nhe might not have any problems. (Tr. 51) He started the tapering process with the \nassistance of his doctor, and then he quit \u201ccold turkey\u201d without his doctor\u2019s agreement. \n(Tr. 108) \nIn July 2017, Applicant was unable to sleep for five consecutive days.

(Tr. 40) He went to the \nemergency room, and told the doctor about his homicidal thought. He was admitted for \nmental-health treatment on July 9, 2017, for the fifth time. (Tr. 40) He said he has been \ntaking 15 to 20 milligrams of Zyprexa daily ever since July 2017. (Tr. 41, 49-50, 73) He \nmight miss a day occasionally because he wants to ensure he wakes up on time and is \nnot drowsy. (Tr. 73) He is currently taking 15 milligrams of Zyprexa at night. (Tr. 50) He \nhas not been hospitalized for mental-health treatment since 2017. (Tr. 41)  \nApplicant\u2019s mother characterized his thoughts about shooting up a mall as a \n\u201cpassive ideation\u201d because he lacked a firearm, ammunition, and a detailed plan to \neffectuate this objective. (Tr. 98) He has not had any suicidal or homicidal ideations since \nJuly 2017.

Applicant\u2019s prognosis was guarded because \nhe had stopped taking his medications in the past and Dr. B was not confident that he \nwas receiving proper treatment for Schizophrenic and Bipolar symptoms. \nThe DCSA CAF asked Dr. B to provide a mental-health assessment of Applicant. \n(GE 2) Dr. B is a licensed clinical psychologist and a board-certified neuropsychologist. \nId. at 4. Dr. B reviewed Applicant\u2019s mental-health records, conducted a Personality \nAssessment Inventory, interviewed Applicant\u2019s treating nurse practitioner, and \ninterviewed Applicant. Id. at 1. Dr. B concluded: \nAlthough [Applicant] was pleasant and seemed honest in his report of \nsymptoms (and in his honest inability to report his own history, at times), my \ninterview of his treating provider suggests [that] he has not fully disclosed \nhis history to her. She has diagnosed him only with delusional disorder, and \nwas unaware of a history of hallucinations, mania, or homicidal ideation. Of \ncourse, I am not certain if this was an intentional effort to hide information \nor if his provider did not thoroughly gather historical information. His treating \nprovider also indicated that he is medication compliant and symptom-free, \nbut his presentation suggests he still has some slightly cloudiness of \nthought that is likely a symptom. He stated that he is medication compliant, \nbut is prescribed only Zyprexa. I would classify his prognosis as guarded at \nthis time because he has stopped his medications in the past and I am not \nconfident that he is receiving proper treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar \nsymptoms (rather he is only being treated for delusion disorder). Therefore, \nI do have some concerns regarding his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not \nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline.

No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security /concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), and 28(d). Further details will \nbe discussed in the mitigation analysis, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant had manic or psychotic episodes in 2011, 2012, and 2017. He was \nhospitalized twice in 2011, twice in 2012, and once in 2017. He had suicidal and \nhomicidal ideations without plans in that he expressed an intent to kill himself and shoot \nup a mall. In 2019, a clinical psychologist diagnosed him with Schizoaffective disorder, \nBipolar type. Applicant admitted that he was hospitalized five times for a mental-health \ndisorder, failed to follow medical advice concerning taking prescribed medicine, and \nthreatened to shoot up a mall. He admitted in 2012 he falsely told his mental-health \nprovider that he was taking his prescribed medication. \nA manic or psychotic episode may result in behavior: that casts doubt on an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, and it may result in an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible \nbehavior or self-harm. A person in the throes of a manic or psychotic episode might \njeopardize national security. \nApplicant failed to prove he took actions necessary to mitigate security concerns \nin this case over the previous three years. First, he failed to prove that he consistently \nand regularly met with a qualified mental-health provider and accurately provided \ninformation about his past and current mental-health situation. Second, he failed to prove \nthat he followed the mental-health provider\u2019s treatment recommendations. \nApplicant provided billing records that showed significant periods in which he did \nnot see a mental-health provider for more than three months. When he missed \nappointments, he said he made up the missed appointment as soon as an appointment \nbecame available. This is incorrect. He missed appointments on January 10, 2022, and \n10 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \non January 25, 2022, and he did not go to an appointment until April 21, 2022, with a \ndifferent health-care provider. Applicant did not provide accurate and complete \ninformation about his medical history to his provider. Dr. B said his provider in 2019 \u201chas \ndiagnosed him only with delusional disorder, and was unaware of a history of \nhallucinations, mania, or homicidal ideation.\u201d (GE 2 at 3) It is unclear whether his current \nprovider has accurate about Applicant\u2019s mental-health history. Applicant may be \nreceiving treatment for a delusion disorder when he actually needs treatment for \nSchizoaffective disorder, Bipolar type. His quarterly appointments may not be frequent \nenough to safeguard classified information and may not be optimum to protect his mental \nhealth. \nThe April 22, 2022 statement of Nurse S states \u201c[Applicant] has consistently taken \nmedication since 2011.\u201d This is incorrect. When he failed to take medication in violation \nof medical recommendations, a psychotic or manic episode was triggered. \nAfter a careful review of the evidence, I believe Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis \nare the most accurate and reliable. Lingering concerns that Applicant\u2019s mental-health \ncondition may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness remain. He \nmay miss appointments, start to believe the diagnosis is incorrect, elect to stop taking \nprescribed medication, and a psychotic or manic episode may result. Security concerns \nunder Guideline I are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of Applicant\u2019s acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline I are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old software engineer, who has worked for a DOD \ncontractor since early 2019. In 2011, he received an Eagle Boy Scout award. In 2016, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering with a minor in mathematics; and \nin 2022, he completed seven of ten courses towards a master\u2019s degree in aerospace \nsystems engineering. He is in an engineering honor society which is limited to the top 20 \npercent of the engineering class. He is exceptionally intelligent. \nApplicant believes he has a good job, is doing well in his master\u2019s degree program, \nand enjoys his social community. In 2019 and 2020, his employer lauded his performance \nin his evaluations. He has assisted multiple volunteer organizations in his community. \nHe plays several sports, and he attends church. He is a gifted musician. He has \nnumerous friends. \nApplicant had manic or psychotic episodes in 2011, 2012, and 2017. He was \nhospitalized twice in 2011, twice in 2012, and once in 2017 to treat psychotic or manic \nepisodes. He expressed an intent to kill himself and shoot up a mall. Dr. B correctly \ndiagnosed him with Schizoaffective disorder, Bipolar type. Applicant admits that he has \na history of psychotic episodes, but does not accept that he has a Schizoaffective \ndisorder. Dr. B said her prognosis was guarded because of evidence that Applicant was \nnot fully candid with mental-health providers about his history, and sometimes stopped \ntaking prescription medication against medical advice. \nApplicant did not attend any appointments from October 12, 2021, until receiving \nan evaluation from Nurse S in April 2022. This gap in medical appointments causes \nconcern especially in light of his failure to go to two appointments in January 2022. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

(Tr. 57) He was authorized to speak to her through a third party. (Tr. \n59) Applicant went to a police station to obtain help getting his clothes from the mother of \nhis child.

(Tr. 73) Applicant understands the difference between an arrest, a charge, and \na dismissed charge. (Tr. 72-73) As to the August 2018 offense, Applicant acknowledged \nthe police arrested him for violation of the protection order, but he did not disclose it \nbecause he believed there should not have been a record of the offense and the charge \nwas dismissed. (Tr. 73-74) \nApplicant said he did not tell the person assisting him with completion of his SCA \nabout the DUI arrest in 2014. (Tr. 95-96) He told her about the arrest in 2018, and that \nthe charge was dismissed, and she said \u201cto put no and keep going.\u201d (Tr. 85) He did not \nask her for a statement corroborating her advice about not disclosing the information \nabout dismissed charges on his SCA prior to his hearing.

(Tr. 99) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. The disqualifying conditions will be \ndiscussed in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nFrom 2003 to August 2018, Applicant was charged with multiple misdemeanor-\nlevel criminal offenses, including disorderly conduct, contempt of court, and DUI. He was \nclearly not guilty of the August 2018 violation of the protection order because he went to \nthe police station to seek assistance from a police officer to ask the mother of his daughter \nfor some of his clothing. The judge dismissed this charge. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent criminal offense was disorderly conduct and failure to \ncomply in September 2015, almost seven years ago. He has been successfully employed \nin the mail room. He is more mature and responsible now. After careful assessment of \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation, I am persuaded that his criminal conduct does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant\u2019s October 2, 2018 SCA asked clear and easily understood questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s record of arrests and convictions of criminal offenses. He has two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees, and understood the information the government sought. He was \nrequired to disclose any alcohol-related arrests. Applicant said he thought about his \nanswers before he provided them, and he rationalized that he did not need to disclose \nalcohol-related arrests unless they were after October 2, 2011, and they resulted in a \nconviction. Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his alcohol-related arrests on his 2018 \nSCA as follows: 2009 (public drunkenness); 2011 (DUI); and 2013 (DUI). \nApplicant was supposed to report his arrests or citations in the previous seven \nyears in which he received a fine over $300 and for any criminal offense. Applicant \nintentionally failed to disclose on his 2018 SCA the following arrests: 2013 (Disorderly \nConduct-Failure to Comply fined $500); 2015 (Disorderly Conduct-Failure to Comply fined \n$500); and 2018, (Failure to Appear and Contempt, dismissed). \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nI find that Applicant understood the questions on his 2018 SCA about arrests for \nvarious criminal offenses, and he intentionally failed to disclose this information with intent \nto deceive. \nAs for the criminal conduct being cross-alleged under the personal conduct \nguideline, AG \u00b6 16 has three disqualifying conditions that are relevant in this case to \nassessment of SOR \u00b6 2.f. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. As indicated in the \nprevious section, Guideline J is the most appropriate guideline for Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e)(1) are established. The disqualifying conditions will be \ndiscussed in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated instances of criminal conduct from 2003 to 2015 hurt his \nreputation in the community and must be considered under the totality of the \ncircumstances. However, as indicated in the criminal conduct section, the offenses are \nnot recent, he has matured since 2015, he is living independently, and he has a good \nemployment record. SOR \u00b6 1.c is mitigated. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \narrests for alcohol-related criminal offenses and other criminal offenses in the past seven \nyears on his October 2, 2018 SCA. His denials of relevant arrests for criminal offenses \non his 2018 SCA continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines J and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old mail-room worker employed by a DOD contractor since \n2018. In 2003, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in physical education, and in 2006, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in kinesiology with a minor in psychology. Applicant is \ncurrent on his child-support responsibilities. He has not received any disciplinary action \nfrom his employer. There is no evidence of abuse of illegal drugs. He was severely injured \nin an accident in 2007, and the accident may have affected his memory. He is working \nfor a company that assists in the rehabilitation of disabled people. \nApplicant gets along well with his coworkers. He wants to provide financial support \nto his family. On March 11, 2022, the director of a company assisting the developmentally \ndisabled said Applicant \u201chas performed his work in our mail room very well. We have seen \nno personal or employment related issues and do consider him to be of good character.\u201d \n(AE A) On July 12, 2022, the director wrote that Applicant \u201chas been an excellent \nemployee\u201d and there were no known issues of concern pertaining to his security \nclearance. His sister said he is trustworthy, and he does a good job in the mail room. He \nhas matured tremendously in the last several years. \nApplicant committed multiple misdemeanor-level criminal offenses from 2003 to \n2015. He has not committed any criminal offenses since 2015. His criminal offenses are \nmitigated for the reasons described in the criminal conduct section, supra. \nThe evidence against mitigation of his false statements on his 2018 SCA is more \nconvincing. On October 2, 2018, Applicant completed an SCA, and he failed to disclose \narrests for alcohol-related criminal offenses and arrests for other criminal offenses within \nseven years. He rationalized that he should only have to disclose convictions not arrests \nand arrests with convictions within seven years. Even so, he failed to report two criminal \nconvictions within seven years that resulted in $500 fines for each one. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Criminal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns related to \nthe falsification of his 2018 SCA are not mitigated. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

(HE 3) He \nalso provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nAdditional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old former DOD-contractor employee who is seeking \nemployment for a defense contractor in the area of weapons of mass destruction \nresponse mitigation and proliferation analysis. (Tr. 7-9, 21-23; GE 1) A defense contractor \nemployed him from 1999 to March 2016. (Tr. 23) After March 2016, he worked in retail. \n(Tr. 7-9) He is exceptionally intelligent. There is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug \nabuse, or security violations. \nIn 1993, Applicant graduated from high school. (GE 1) In 1998, he received two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees in environmental science and physics from a prestigious university. \n(Tr. 7-8, 22) He has several highly technical engineering and statistics-related \ncertifications.

(Tr. 9) \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in March 2020, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder, moderate. Applicant agreed the diagnosis was accurate in March 2020. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant felt stress at work from interactions with coworkers and due to extensive \nmission-related travel. (Tr. 24-25) He left defense-related employment in March 2016 \nbecause his branch of the company was being sold.

(Tr. 31, 35) During 2020, he worked for a defense contractor for six \nmonths in his specialty, and then he was unable to work because the security levels for \nhis employment were increased. (Tr. 32-33) \nApplicant has a family history of excessive alcohol consumption and mental health \ndisorders. (Tr. 37) He acknowledged a personal predisposition to these issues. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant first consumed alcohol at age 11. (Tr. 38) He consumed alcohol in \ncollege, and drank more regularly after college. (Tr. 38) He estimated that after college \nhe consumed about six beers a week. (Tr. 38) After he started his defense-related \nemployment and was traveling, he drank four to six beers a day. (Tr. 39) \nIn the 2010 to 2011 period, the volume of Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption peaked. \n(Tr. 74) Around 2010, while Applicant was on mission-related travel, he consumed \nsufficient alcohol for an alcohol blackout. (Tr. 59-62) He did not remember how he went \nfrom the bar where he was drinking to his hotel room. (Tr. 59) He believed one of his \nMarine Corps companions at the bar drove him to his hotel. (Tr. 60) He missed the class \nhe was supposed to attend the next day. (Tr. 59-61) \nIn 2011, Applicant was consuming alcohol when he erroneously believed a bottle \nin his freezer contained vodka. He consumed about six ounces of methanol that he was \nstoring in his freezer to use to maintain his vehicle. (Tr. 55-56) He called poison control \nand an ambulance took him to the emergency room. (Tr. 56) He was hospitalized \novernight. (Tr. 57) \nIn 2015, Applicant was consuming alcohol and he slipped off of the couch, and cut \nhis toe on a knife that was on the floor. (Tr. 62) He received care at an urgent care clinic. \n(Tr. 62) The incidents in 2011 and 2015 were the only alcohol-related incidents after which \nhe received medical care. (Tr. 63) \nIn 2016, Applicant consumed alcohol, and then he went to a park (Tr. 57) He fell \nasleep in the park. (Tr. 58) It was cold and there was snow on the ground. (Tr. 57-58) His \nalarm went off; he awoke; and he walked back to his residence. (Tr. 58) He did not suffer \nfrostbite or other cold-related injury. \nAfter he left his defense-related employment in 2016, he increased his alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 29) During a five-month period in 2017, he occasionally drank 500 \nmilliliters of alcohol (tequila or gin) on more than one day during a week. (Tr. 40) The \nfrequency of his alcohol consumption peaked in 2017, and later in 2017, he reduced his \nalcohol consumption. (Tr. 43-44, 74) In 2017, he hid bottles around his residence, and \nconsumed alcohol in the middle of the night. (Tr. 44) Applicant hid his alcohol \nconsumption from his cohabitant by consuming alcohol outside of her presence, such as \nwhen she was at work.

(Tr. 64) \nApplicant attended individual therapy and group counseling from 2018 to 2020. \n(Tr. 64) He attended about 15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 72) His therapist \nmet with him on a weekly basis for 50-minute sessions which focused on treatment of his \nanxiety and replacement of alcohol as a coping mechanism with more constructive means \nof coping with stress. (Tr. 65-66) In late 2018, he began 105-minute weekly group therapy \nsessions, and he limited his alcohol consumption to three to four beers for each drinking \nsession. (Tr. 45, 66) In March 2020, he stopped meeting with a therapist because the \nCOVID-19 pandemic security protocols for video teleconferencing were not adequate. \n(Tr. 67) His therapist did not provide a written diagnosis or prognosis. (Tr. 67) Applicant \nwas never explicitly told that he should abstain from alcohol consumption; however, he \nacknowledged that during group sessions the message was that it was best to completely \nabstain from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 68-70) \nApplicant\u2019s current level of alcohol consumption is \u201calmost zero.\u201d (Tr. 46) He did \nnot drink any alcohol for about eight months in 2021. Then, during one three-day weekend \nabout one month before his hearing while visiting family, he drank nine beers. (Tr. 47, 54) \nThis was the most alcohol he consumed in the previous year. (Tr. 47) He acknowledge \nthat after consuming one drink, inhibitions are somewhat relaxed, and the next drink is \nmore of a possibility. (Tr. 75-76) He is confident that he is able to control the amount of \nalcohol he consumes. (Tr. 71-72) He lives in a drug and alcohol free community. (Tr. 73) \nOn March 5, 2020, a psychologist, Dr. B, evaluated Applicant, and she diagnosed \nalcohol use disorder (moderate). (GE 2 at 6) Dr. B said: \nGiven [Applicant\u2019s] drinking habits, his family history of substance abuse \nand mental health conditions, as well as [Personality Assessment Inventory \n(PAI)] results pointing to significant alcohol-related problems and variable \nmood, there is reason for concern. These factors, coupled with his history \nof alcohol-related incidents and lack of long term plans to abstain from \nalcohol, raise questions about his judgment.  \n \n* * * \nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the risk of future alcohol-related incidents \nseems moderate, and [Applicant\u2019s] prognosis appears guarded. Although \n[Applicant] reported that he had been consistent with individual and group \ntherapy, and he has gained insight into himself and his drinking, a medical \nopinion could not be obtained and during the investigatory process, he \nconsistently conveyed a lack of confidence in his ability to avoid relapse in \nthe face of future stressors. As such, his diagnosis could pose a risk to his \njudgment, reliability or trustworthiness concerning classified information. \n(GE at 6) (emphasis added) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the time of his March 2020 evaluation, Applicant had been sober for two months, and \nhe was concerned about \u201creversion into the past behaviors and activities.\u201d (Tr. 50) After \nhis March 2020 evaluation, he ended his alcohol-related therapies; nevertheless, he is \nnow comfortable with his current state of limited to almost zero alcohol use. (Tr. 50) \nApplicant recognized that after receiving the March 2020 evaluation he would have \na better change of approval of his access to classified information if he stopped \nconsuming alcohol. (Tr. 76-77) However, he decided to continue his alcohol consumption \nbecause complete abstinence from alcohol as not his goal or intention. (Tr. 77) He did not \nwant to stop consuming alcohol because of his security clearance. (Tr. 77) He rationalized \nthat the reason for ending his alcohol consumption should be because of his personal \ngoals and not because of security concerns related to his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 77) \nApplicant never drives after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 51) He has consumed \nsufficient alcohol over the last three years to be intoxicated three or four times. (Tr. 51) \nThe most alcohol he consumed in the previous three years was one mixed drink and five \nbeers in November 2020, when his father passed away. (Tr. 48) \nThe DSM criteria for diagnosis of alcohol-use disorder for mild (presence of 2-3 \nsymptoms), moderate (presence of 4-5 symptoms), and severe (presence of 6 or more \nsymptoms) are as follows: \nA. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant \nimpairment or distress as manifested by at least two of the following, \noccurring within a 12-month period: \n1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was \nintended. \n2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control \nalcohol use. \n3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use \nalcohol, or recover from its effects. \n4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol. \n5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations \nat work, school, or home. \n6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or \ninterpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. \n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or \nreduced because of alcohol use. \n8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. \n9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or \nrecurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been \ncaused or exacerbated by alcohol. \n10.

Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) \nis taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms \nDSM-5 at 490-491; GE 6. \nApplicant provided statements from four character witnesses. (AE A-AE D) \nThe general sense of his character statements is that he is a model employee, who \nis mature, professional, empathetic, punctual, helpful, trustworthy, responsible, and \nreliable. Two statements also described an improvement in his weight, health, and \ngeneral wellbeing in the last few years. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd.

Additional \ndiscussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily and credibly disclosed his history of \nalcohol consumption during his OPM interview, during his March 2020 evaluation, and at \nhis hearing. He attended individual and group counseling. He reduced the amount and \nfrequency of his alcohol consumption. He has never been arrested or convicted of any \nalcohol related offense.

However, his satisfaction of the DSM-\n5 criteria for sustained remission does not necessarily establish mitigation for security \nclearance requirements.  \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In 2010, Applicant \nhad an instance of alcohol-related memory loss or an alcohol blackout. The memory loss \nwas due to binge-alcohol consumption. In an alcohol blackout, a person: \nis still fully conscious. They\u2019re moving around, acting, engaging, talking, \ndancing, driving, engaging in all kinds of behavior, but because of alcohol\u2019s \ninhibition of the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term \nmemory, they simply will be unable to remember those decisions or actions \nthey made while in the blackout. \nIn United States v. Pease, 74 M.J. 763, 769 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), an expert \non the effects of alcohol intoxication, Dr. Kim Fromme, Ph.D., described the levels of \nalcohol intoxication and the impact on human behavior, cognitive abilities, and memory. \nSee also United States v.

(testimony of prosecution toxicology expert, Jon \nJemiomek). \nA person who is in a blacked-out state may still \u201cengage in voluntary behavior and \nthought processes. \u2018They might make decisions, for example, to drive home from a bar, \nor [engage in other] . . . activities which require complex cognitive abilities, but the \nindividual might not remember the next day and might, in fact, might regret it.\u2019\u201d Pease, 74 \nM.J. at 769.

A person who consumes alcohol to a blacked-out state may not remember \nhow much alcohol they consumed, or they may violate national security and have no \nrecollection of their conduct.  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn March 2020, Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder (moderate) \ndespite two months of sobriety before the evaluation. Applicant had multiple alcohol-\nrelated instances such as injury to his toe, missing a class, and mistakenly drinking about \nsix ounces of methanol. \nApplicant drank nine beers over a three-day period 30 days before his hearing. He \nhas consumed sufficient alcohol over the last three years to be intoxicated on three or \nfour occasions. A commitment to sobriety is not required under the Adjudicative \nGuidelines; however, his declination from committing to sobriety while holding a security \nclearance is inconsistent with the recommendation of the evaluating psychologist, Dr. B. \nHe attended numerous therapeutic sessions, including about 15 AA meetings, and \ncomplete sobriety as a goal is often suggested at those sessions. Nevertheless, Applicant \nhas elected to continue alcohol consumption. Moreover, if Applicant receives a security \nclearance and resumes stressful employment, there is also an increased risk he will utilize \nalcohol to address his anxiety. Applicant has not fully accepted the risk entailed in his \nstrategy of continued, albeit limited, alcohol consumption. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and plans for continued alcohol \nconsumption cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. None of \nthe mitigating conditions fully apply, and Guideline G security concerns are not mitigated \nat this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline G are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old former DOD-contractor employee who is seeking \nemployment for a defense contractor in the area of weapons of mass destruction \nresponse mitigation and proliferation analysis.

He has several highly \ntechnical engineering and statistics-related certifications. He is exceptionally intelligent. \nThere is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug abuse, or security violations. \nThe general sense of Applicant\u2019s four character statements is that he is a model \nemployee, who is mature, professional, empathetic, punctual, helpful, trustworthy, \nresponsible, and reliable. There has been an improvement in his weight, health, and \ngeneral wellbeing in the last several years. \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive. Applicant has a history of binge alcohol consumption, an alcohol blackout in \n2010, and alcohol-related instances including injury to his toe, missing a class, and \nmistakenly drinking about six ounces of methanol. In March 2020, a psychologist \ndiagnosed him with alcohol use disorder (moderate) and commented that his \u201clack of long \nterm plans to abstain from alcohol, raise questions about his judgment.\u201d Despite \ncompletion of counseling, attendance at AA meetings, and therapy, he continues to \nconsume alcohol. He did not provide an opinion from a substance abuse counselor or \npsychologist indicating a positive diagnosis or prognosis.  \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nThe SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DCSA CAS adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance, \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a\ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 10, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations, and \nrequesting a hearing. On May 18, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) assigned the case to me. On June 14, 2022, DOHA scheduled the hearing for \nJuly 25, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled.

(Tr. 35) She \nalready owned the property when she married her second husband, with whom she was \nmarried when she immigrated to the United States approximately ten years ago. When \nthey divorced in a U.S. state court, her second husband formally acknowledged that he \nhad no ownership right to the condominium.

When she \ntraveled to the PRC most recently in 2017, the PRC government agreed to allow her to \nsell the condominium if she obtained a certified copy of the divorce decree. (Tr. 46) \nApplicant\u2019s wife obtained one, but has been unable to return to the PRC since the \nCOVID crisis. (Tr. 39) While the sales process has been pending, Applicant\u2019s wife has \nbeen renting it. Applicant does not know how much his wife is receiving in rental \npayments. (Tr. 36) \nApplicant\u2019s wife intends to become a United States citizen, but is waiting until \nafter she sells the condominium. Per Applicant, if she became a U.S. citizen, it would \ncomplicate the sales process because PRC law discourages foreigners from engaging \nin PRC real estate transactions. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant\u2019s stepson is in his mid-twenties. (GE 1 at 34) He is a citizen of the \nPRC. He immigrated to the United States with his parents approximately ten years ago. \nSubsequently, he graduated from high school and college in the United States. \nCurrently, he lives in the United States in a townhouse owned by his mother and \nApplicant, and pays them rent. (Tr. 80) \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law worked for the PRC\u2019s department of agriculture. (Tr. 30) He is retired. \nApplicant is not sure what his mother-in-law did for a living. Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law \nare in extremely poor health. His wife talks to them approximately every other day and \nuses her Chinese pension to pay their medical expenses. (Tr. 41, 43) \nApplicant\u2019s wife maintains a bank account in PRC to help her parents. (Tr. 31) \nThe account has a balance of approximately $24,000. (Tr. 31) Her PRC pension is \ndeposited into this account. \nApplicant\u2019s home is worth approximately $525,000.  (Tr. 48) He has $40,000 in a \nchecking account and $6,000 deposited in a savings account. (Tr. 49) \nAdministrative Notice \nThe PRC is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party. (HE I \nat 1) is the paramount authority. (HE I at 1) The PRC is one of the most active collectors \nof illicitly gained technology in the world. (HE 1 at 1) The PRC National Intelligence law \nof 2017 forms the baseline of the modern data collection regime and compels all PRC \nfirms and entities to support, assist, and cooperate with the PRC intelligence services, \ncreating a legal obligation for those entities to turn over data collected abroad and \ndomestically to the PRC. (HE IV at 6) The PRC government has the legal and physical \ncapability to compel any Chinese citizen to turn over information.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The PRC is one of the most active practicioners of \nespionage against the U.S. government and U.S. businesses in the world. Theft of trade \nsecrets, military secrets, and intellectual property is not only encouraged by the PRC \ngovernment; it is legally authorized by the PRC National Intelligence Law of 2017. One \nmethod of espionage is the coercion of foreign nationals and their family members to \ndivulge sensitive information. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s relationship with \nhis wife, a PRC foreign national and his parents in-law, both PRC citizens and \nresidents, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of, or resident in a foreign county if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \nApplicant lives with his wife. Consequently, AG \u00b6 7(e), \u201cshared living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or  coercion,\u201d  also \napplies to their relationship. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s stepson is a citizen of the PRC, he has been living in the \nUnited States since high school, graduating from both high school and college here. I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his stepson does not trigger a security \nconcern, and resolve subparagraph 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse retired from her position as a professor at a university in the \nPRC. I resolve subparagraph 1.f in her favor. \nGiven that Applicant\u2019s father is retired from the PRC government\u2019s department of \nagriculture, and is in extremely poor health, his former employment does not increase \nthe overall security concerns. I resolve subparagraph 1.g in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe PRC, an authoritarian state, is a strategic competitor dedicated to \nundermining U.S. goals, cyber-attacking U.S. military and U.S. infrastructure, and \nstealing U.S. business\u2019 trade secrets. Consequently, AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the \nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or \nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d is inapplicable. \nApplicant worked in positions supporting the military for nearly 40 years. He has \nheld a security clearance for at least half of that time. However, \u201ceven a person of the \nhighest character can experience circumstances under which he or she can be tempted \nto place the well-being of foreign relatives over the interests of the U.S.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2019). Consequently, given the depth, scope, and \nintensity of the PRC\u2019s hostile espionage activities against the United States and U.S. \ninterests, and their history of targeting PRC foreign nationals to achieve these \nobjectives, I cannot conclude that AG  \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or \nallegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest,\u201d applies. \nThe potential that the PRC may seek to exploit Applicant through his wife\u2019s PRC \nproperty interests is equally as high as the possibility that the PRC may seek to exploit\nhim through his in-laws who are PRC citizens and residents. However, the value of his\nwife\u2019s PRC interests is minimal in relation to their U.S. property interests, and as such,\nrenders it \u201cunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure\u201d Applicant.

(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-012317 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 9, 2014) \nConsequently, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nI considered the whole-person factors when I evaluated Applicant\u2019s credibility \nunder the foreign influence section of the Decision, and they do not warrant a \nfavorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20 (e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant did not provide evidence to support his \nassertions that he had resolved his debts or had established a repayment plan. The credit \nreports reflect inaction on his part. The fact that not all debts are reflected on the May \n2022 credit report is not meaningful evidence of the disposition of the debts. See ISCR \nCase No. 18-1250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). A statement that he was working to \nresolve a debt in the future based on a loan forgiveness program is not a substitute for a \ntrack record of paying debts in a timely manner. He produced no evidence of significant \nactions to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. The three exhibits he submitted \nin August 2022, show action on other debts, but do not show action on the debts alleged. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence showing he \ndisputed the legitimacy of these debts or any actions to resolve the issue the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. The three exhibits he submitted in August 2022, show he disputed a \ndate involving account opened after he completed his SCA, but do not show action on the \ndebts alleged. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant's state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant's experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. See ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant made no effort to \n \n correct the \nomissions in his SCA until he was confronted with them during the August 2016 PSI. His \nfalsification is arguably infrequent, but it is recent and it is not \u201cminor\u201d given the amount \nof debt and that the majority of the debt was accumulated obtaining his college degree, \nwhich is not a random debt that may have been overlooked. Falsification of a security \nclearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.)

I conclude that AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and falsification of \nhis SCA. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In March 1986, while he was \non active duty in the Navy, he was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) and \nsentenced to probation for two years. (GX 1 at 30-31.) He was required to complete a six-\nweek alcohol rehabilitation program. He did not resume consuming alcohol until 1993. \n(Tr. 27-28.) \nApplicant testified that when he returned from a deployment to Iraq in 2003, he \nwas depressed and distant. He turned to alcohol in an unsuccessful attempt to escape \nfrom his depression. He started seeing a counselor in 2005, because he was struggling \nwith his feelings about his role in the taking of lives. After a shore duty assignment, he \nvolunteered to deploy again with his old unit. When he returned, he talked to his wife \nabout his depression, and her response was, \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to feel sorry for you; you \nvolunteered for this.\u201d (Tr. 30-31.) Between 2005 and 2010, he sometimes drank to excess, \nand he believed he was an alcoholic. (Tr. 33.) \nIn May 2011, Applicant\u2019s wife left him. He thought about suicide. When he told his \nprimary physician about his suicidal thoughts, his physician told him he needed treatment. \nHe completed a four-day inpatient program that he did not find helpful. His wife moved \nback into the home for a few days and then left again. In June 2011, he overdosed on a \nprescription sleep medication combined with alcohol. His wife found him unconscious \nwhen she came to the house on the following morning, and she took him to a hospital. \nApplicant was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital in July 2011 for \npsychiatric stabilization. He was discharged a week later and diagnosed with a major \ndepressive disorder, recurrent, and alcohol abuse. He was prescribed a drug to reduce \nhis craving for alcohol and a drug for his depression. His prognosis was \u201cfair if compliant \nwith the medicine.\u201d (GX 3 at 11.) \nDuring 2011 and 2012, Applicant was drinking one or two drinks in the evening \nevery day. His consumption on weekends was heavier. At the same time, he was taking \nmedications for depression, even though he was advised to not consume alcohol while \ntaking the antidepressants. (Tr. 35.) His depression and alcohol abuse worsened after his \ndivorce. (Tr. 21-22.) He saw a psychologist regularly until July 2012, when he moved to \nanother location. (Tr. 37-38.) \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption increased to five or six drinks at day. (Tr. 41.) In \nOctober 2015, he was arrested and charged with DWI. (GX 1 at 28.) He reported his \narrest to his employer, as required. (GX 2 at 6.) His case was referred to a Veteran\u2019s \nCourt, where he pleaded guilty. He was required to compete a nine-month program that \nbegan in September 2016 and involved wearing an ankle monitor for alcohol, mentoring, \ncounseling, random urinalysis, and victim impact panels. He was required to attend the \nprogram for three additional months because he consumed alcohol once during the \nprogram. He completed the program in May 2017. (AX J.) After he completed the \nprogram, the charges against him were dismissed, and record of his arrest and conviction \nwas expunged.

(Tr. \n31.) \nOn February 14, 2018, Applicant was self-admitted to a psychiatric hospital for \noutpatient treatment after he developed suicidal ideation while intoxicated. He was \ndiagnosed with a major depressive disorder. After two days, he was discharged at his \nrequest, because the treatment was not covered by his insurance. (GX 5; Tr. 52.) \nOn February 19, 2018, which would have been Applicant\u2019s 30th anniversary with \nhis ex-wife, he began feeling severely depressed. He told his son how he was feeling, \nand his son took him to a hospital for outpatient treatment. He was discharged on March \n9, 2018, at his request so that he could return to work. (GX 6.) He was advised to seek a \nmental health professional and to stop consuming alcohol. (Tr. 55.) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2018, he told \nthe investigator that he and the woman who became his second wife both enjoyed going \nto draft breweries on weekends, and he usually consumed about two beers at one of the \nbreweries. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 56.) As they approached the date of their marriage, Applicant \nincreased his alcohol consumption due to the stress of merging households. \nIn July 2019, the CAF requested that Applicant undergo a mental health \nevaluation. He was evaluated in November 2019 by a licensed psychologist. He was \ndiagnosed with a major depressive disorder, in partial remission, and an alcohol use \ndisorder, moderate. The psychologist\u2019s diagnostic impressions included the following \ncomments: \nClinical interview, psychological testing, and medical records converge to \nsuggest [Applicant] experienced intermittent depressive symptoms for \napproximately 17 years. At times, since 2011, these symptoms have been \ncoupled with suicidal ideation after his ex-wife moved out of their home. \nMore severe depressive symptoms apparently tended to occur annually in \nFebruary, the date of his previous anniversary with his ex-wife. However, \nhe denies experiencing any significant symptoms of anxiety or depression \nat the present time. His psychological testing does not indicate any \nsignificant distress. His mental health symptoms appear to be managed \npresently with [a prescription drug], and he has apparently gained insight \nand coping skills through therapy. Any depressive symptoms he may be \nexperiencing presently do not appear to be significantly impacting his \noccupational or social functioning.  \nThe psychologist stated, however, that Applicant\u2019s decision to consume beer gave \nher pause, \u201cgiven his history of alcohol abuse in conjunction with his previous treatment \nprovider\u2019s recommendation of abstinence.\u201d (GX 7 at 6.)

Her evaluation states: \nThe results of standardized testing revealed the client to have a low \nprobability of an alcohol use disorder. The client has no problematic use, \nnor is there a pattern to the use. There are no clinical effects, and there is \nno interference in the patient\u2019s life. The client has ceased all consumption \nof alcohol. \nThis evaluator determined that Applicant has no alcohol use disorder and that no \ntreatment is warranted. (AX R.) Although Department Counsel objected to consideration \nof her evaluation on the ground that she was not qualified to make it, I am satisfied that \nher credentials are sufficient to warrant consideration of her evaluation, although she may \nhave exceeded the limits of her qualifications by expressing opinions about the \napplicability of the adjudicative guidelines. \nIn late December 2020, Applicant completed an online four-hour behavior \nmodification course and an online four-hour drug and alcohol awareness course. (AX P; \nAX Q.) In June 2022, he took a PETH test to determine the presence of alcohol in his \nblood, and it was negative. (AX R.) \nApplicant suffered a stroke on February 12, 2022, which he believes was due in \npart to his alcohol abuse, failure to control his diabetes, and hypertension. Since his \nstroke, he has changed his dietary and exercise habits, takes his medicines as \nprescribed, and has not consumed alcohol. (Tr. 21-24.) He testified that his primary care \nphysician since the summer of 2013 had warned him that he had two choices: \u201cstop \ndrinking and live or keep drinking and die.\u201d When Applicant saw his primary care physician \nafter the stroke, she told him, \u201cI told you so, and I\u2019m only going to say that once.\u201d (Tr. 59. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his last drink was on February 11, 2022, the \nnight before his stroke. He did not describe the circumstances of his alcohol consumption \non that date. (Tr. 66.) His vision and hearing were still impaired by the consequences of \nthe stoke. \nApplicant has started seeing a new counselor.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The mental health evaluation obtained by the CAF \nreflects that Applicant\u2019s symptoms appear to be managed by a prescription drug and he \nhas gained insight and coping skills through therapy. However, his prognosis was only \n\u201cfair\u201d because of his continued consumption of alcohol. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and 29(e) are partially established. Applicant\u2019s depressive disorder is \nnot temporary, although it was under control when he was evaluated by the psychologist \nselected by the CAF. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d I have considered the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not applicable. Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an \nadverse determination under Guideline G and is explicitly covered under that guideline.  \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s maladaptive alcohol use is likely to affect \nhis personal, professional standing, but his struggle with depression has not affected it. \nThose who are aware of it are sympathetic and admire him for his ability to perform well \nin spite of it.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse has had devastating \nconsequences. It is recent and has been frequent. It has not occurred under unique \ncircumstances making it unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his behavior and \nobtained counseling, but insufficient time has passed to show that it is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) is not fully established. Applicant has taken positive steps to overcome \nhis alcohol problem, but it is too soon to determine if he has succeeded. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, I, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant has served with distinction for many \nyears, in and out of uniform, and he has held a security clearance during those years, \napparently without incident. He was sincere, remorseful, and candid at the hearing. His \ndepression is being controlled by medication and therapy. However, his latest episode of \nmaladaptive alcohol consumption is too recent to overcome the likelihood of recurrence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, I, and E, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his psychological condition, but he has not \nmitigated the concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",
