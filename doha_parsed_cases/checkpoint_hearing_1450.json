These debts became delinquent because he could not afford to pay \nthem on his limited income. Applicant has established a sufficient track record of \nresponsible action towards resolving them. His delinquent debts in the Statement of \nReasons (SOR) are being resolved. He is now earning enough money to address his \ndebts, and has sufficient savings to continue to do so. Though the debts are ongoing, \nhe has mitigated financial security concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 16, 2018. \nOn September 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant an SOR detailing security concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, due to his delinquent debts. The DOD CAF issued the SOR \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \n\n \n2 \n \n \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 25, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was assigned to me on December 11, 2019. On January 14, 2020, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for February 4, 2020.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I admitted without objection. Applicant \nsubmitted 11 exhibits with his Answer to the SOR, which I labelled as Answer Exhibits \n(Ans. Ex.) 1 through 11. Those documents were admitted without objection. Applicant \nsubmitted 16 additional groups of documents at his hearing, with a related exhibit list. \nFor administrative convenience, I labelled Applicant\u2019s exhibits by number, as he had \ndescribed them on his exhibit list (Hearing Exhibit (HE) III). Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 5 were identical to GE 1 through 5, so they were not included in the record. AE \n6 was the same as Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, so it, too, was not included. (HE III; \nTr. 21-24) AE 7 through AE 16 were admitted without objection. Applicant also testified. \nI held the record open to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ndocumentation. He timely submitted documents that I marked as AE 17 through AE 20. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits were admitted without objection. The record closed on \nFebruary 18, 2020. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on February 19, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, all with explanations and documents. I \nincorporate his admissions and explanations into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He and his wife married in 2016. They have two young \nchildren. (GE 1; Tr. 125-126) Applicant graduated from college in 2009, in his home \nstate, State 1. He then studied at a state university in State 2 from 2009 to 2015, \nearning his master\u2019s degree in 2011 and his doctorate in 2015, in electrical engineering. \nDuring and after his graduate education, he was also employed as a university research \nassistant, from 2009 to December 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 30, 33-34) \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant left academia and moved to State 3 for a job as an \nengineer with a large defense contractor. He has been there ever since. (Tr. 30-31). He \nhas never held a clearance before. (GE 1) He has an annual salary of about $90,000. \nHis wife does not work outside the home. (Tr. 113-114) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR debts are all student loans from Applicant\u2019s undergraduate years. (Tr. \n35, 75-78, 149-151) Applicant received a fellowship for his first year of graduate school \nbecause he was from out of state. During graduate school, he received annual stipends \nof about $20,000 a year. He also received some income as a teaching assistant and a \nresearch assistant. (Tr. 84-85, 128-129) He did not have funds available from his family \nor other sources. He \u201ctried to live as cheaply as possible,\u201d and he lived in graduate \nschool housing. (Tr. 89-91) Once he earned his Ph.D., he earned about $80,000 as a \nuniversity faculty member. (Tr. 123-124)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s graduate education was largely funded through his fellowship, and his \nwork as a teaching assistant and research assistant. (Tr. 128-129) He said he only took \nout one loan during graduate school, early in his first semester, for about $24,000. (Tr. \n88, 140) \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent during his time in graduate school. \nHe acknowledged that he did not communicate with the lenders to address them during \nthat time, nor did he attempt to defer the loans. He received calls from collectors during \ngraduate school but did not act, because he could not afford to pay them. (Tr. 85-86, \n158-160) By the time he earned his Ph.D., he owed several hundred thousand dollars in \nstudent loans. (Tr. 78-79) He said that he had \u201cso much debt that I couldn\u2019t possibly pay \nit back,\u201d and the accounts became delinquent. (Tr. 35-36, 129-130) \n  \nIn early 2017, after his father passed away, Applicant received about $100,000 \nfrom his father\u2019s life insurance policy, and about $20,000 from the sale of his late \nfather\u2019s house. (GE 1 at 79; Tr. 93-96, 141-144) Applicant first sought to confirm who \nowned his various loans, before attempting to settle them. He did not want to pay \nmoney to someone without confirming that they owed his loan. Dealing with his father\u2019s \nestate also took significant time. (Tr. 95-97) \n \n  \nWhen he prepared his SCA, in January 2018, Applicant pulled his credit reports \nand disclosed several of the debts. (GE 1 at 60-79; Tr. 36-37) He discussed them in his \nbackground interviews. (GE 5) He also provided additional information and \ndocumentation about his debts in a July 2019 interrogatory response to DOHA. (GE 2) \n \nThe five student loan debts alleged in the SOR total about $128,811. They are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by credit reports from February 2018 and \nMarch 2019. (GE 3, GE 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($45,126): Applicant had three student loan accounts with creditor N. \n(AE 10 at 1) Applicant settled two of the loans with creditor N in June 2019. (Tr. 54; AE \n10 at 15, 19, 20) The third student loan with creditor N is the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a. On \nApplicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report, the amount alleged was charged off in \nDecember 2016. (GE 3 at 3) The debt is not listed on Applicant\u2019s March 2019 credit \nreport (GE 4)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn researching his responsibility for his debts with N, Applicant ultimately \ncommunicated with an outside legal counsel representing N in a bankruptcy case \ninvolving another debtor (not Applicant). (Ans. Ex. 4 at 12). N\u2019s records initially indicated \nthat Applicant\u2019s loan was somehow related to that bankruptcy proceeding, and that, as a \nresult, N had stopped collection on the Applicant\u2019s account. (AE 11 at 12, letter from N\u2019s \ncounsel) However, N later determined that Applicant\u2019s loan is not related to the \nbankruptcy litigation. (AE 11 at 12: \u201cYou and [N] have determined that [Applicant\u2019s] Loan \nis not part of the putative class alleged in the Adversary Proceeding.\u201d)(Tr. 58-62) \n(Emphasis added), \n \nUltimately, Applicant acknowledged that SOR \u00b6 1.a is his responsibility. He also \ndeclared that he intends to settle and resolve the debt as he had with his other two \ndebts with N. (Answer; Tr. 60-64; 100-102, 133-134) It is unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($27,909) is a student loan account from a bank. According to \nApplicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report, the amount alleged was charged off in October \n2015. (GE 3 at 3) Applicant\u2019s March 2019 credit report states the account was charged \noff, with $24,735 past due. (GE 4) Applicant agreed to settle the account for $9,894 with \npayments over the next two years. (Answer; Ans. Ex. 6; AE 14 at 22; Tr. 109-113) He \nprovided documentation of several recent monthly payments of $413. (AE 17, AE 19; \nTr. 66-69, 131) The account is being resolved.  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant expressed his view that the promissory \nnotes for both loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) had been forged. He provided copies of \npromissory notes with what he argued were signatures different from his own. (Answer; \nAns. Ex. 1; Ans. Ex. 2; Ans. Ex. 5; Tr. 38-39, 53-58, 111) He believed the debt at SOR \u00b6 \n1.a was a loan taken out by his half-brother. (Tr. 53, 58, 60-61) He acknowledged, \nhowever, that forgery would be difficult to prove through litigation: \u201cI mean, there\u2019s no \nclear documentation.\u201d (Tr. 111) Moreover, Applicant admitted both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nin his Answer to the SOR and during his testimony, and has taken documented steps to \nresolve each account. In doing so, he has accepted responsibility for the accounts. His \nclaims of forgery are not established. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($12,484) is a student loan account with a bank. Applicant was \ngranted the loan in 2007, for $9,756. In a January 2019 letter to Applicant in response to \nhis inquiry, the creditor noted that the loan was charged off in 2016 in the amount \nalleged, and that it was not able to collect on the debt because the statute of limitations \nhad expired. Accordingly, the creditor cancelled the debt and issued Applicant a Form \n1099-C in 2016. (Ans. Ex. 7; Ans. Ex. 8; AE 8 at 11; Tr. 46-48, 115-118) The IRS \naccounted for the cancelled amount and adjusted Applicant\u2019s 2016 taxable income \naccordingly. (AE 8 at 14) As a result, Applicant was later assessed an additional $3,557 \nin federal income tax for 2016, which is resolved. (AE 8 at 22, 24; Tr. 48-49, 115-118) \nThe account is listed on Applicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report as having been charged \noff, but no balance is noted. (GE 3 at 4) He believes the account is resolved and closed. \n(Tr. 49, 131) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($29,095) is a student loan account with a bank. Applicant entered \ninto the loan in June 2008, for $23,155. The loan was charged off for $29,095 in May \n2014. In December 2017, the creditor cancelled the principal balance of $21,530, and \nissued a Form 1099-C to Applicant. (Answer; Ans. Ex. 9, Ans. Ex. 10; AE 9 at 19; Tr. \n49-51, 118-122) The IRS accounted for the cancelled amount and adjusted his 2017 \ntaxable income accordingly. (AE 9 at 22) As a result, Applicant was later assessed an \nadditional $7,946 in federal income tax for 2017, which is now resolved. (AE 9 at 30, 32, \n131) The account is listed on Applicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report as having been \ncharged off, but no balance is noted. (GE 3 at 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($14,197) is a student loan account with the same bank as SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nApplicant entered into the loan in August 2006. The loan was charged off for $14,197 in \nAugust 2012. In December 2013, the creditor cancelled the principal balance of $13,076 \nand issued a Form 1099-C to Applicant. (Answer; Ans. Ex. 9, Ans. Ex. 11; AE 9 at 16 \nTr. 49-51) The account is listed on Applicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report as having \nbeen charged off, but no balance is noted. (GE 3 at 4; Tr. 131) \n \nApplicant owes two other private loans totaling about $62,000. They include one \nfrom a creditor who filed suit against Applicant in State 1 court. When Applicant became \naware of the suit, he retained counsel. In January 2020, the suit was dismissed without \nprejudice. (AE 15; Tr. 70-72) He also acknowledged that he owes about $33,000 in \nfederal student loans. (Tr. 134-138) \n  \nApplicant has settled several other private student loan debts that were not \nalleged in the SOR. (AE 7, AE 13; Tr. 24, 38, 45-46, 65-66) He also documented the \nstatus of his federal loans. A $2,700 federal student loan he incurred during college has \nbeen paid in full, as of July 2019. (AE 12; Tr. 26, 65) He has also been making $537 \nmonthly payments on another federal student loan, every month since December 2015, \na few months after he finished his schooling. He made $26,326 in payments on that \nloan in the years since then. (AE 16; Tr. 72)  \n \nApplicant has been better able to address his debts since he earned his Ph.D. \nand fully entered the workforce. (Tr. 123-125, 129-130) His intention is to continue to \npay on his loans. (Tr. 141) He now monitors his credit score more closely. (Tr. 138) He \nand his wife rent their home. Their son has developmental issues that have led to \nunexpected expenses, and Applicant expects them to continue. (Tr. 114-115, 123) \n \nApplicant provided a recent bank statement reflecting a combined balance of \nabout $106,000 in his checking and savings accounts. He intends to use these funds to \npay down his student loan debts. (AE 18; Tr. 141-145) \n \nTwo university professors and two current co-workers provided letters of \nrecommendation for Applicant. Professor A worked closely with Applicant for about \nseven years. He attested to Applicant\u2019s \u201cdedication towards accomplishing a task, either \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprofessionally or personally, giving specific examples in difficult conditions. He regards \nApplicant as exceptionally efficient, responsible, and aware of his co-workers\u2019 needs \nand capabilities. (AE 20) \n \nProfessor B hired Applicant as a research assistant early in Applicant\u2019s graduate \nschool years, and served as an advisor for Applicant\u2019s doctoral thesis. Applicant is the \nonly student Professor B has hired as research faculty. He is reliable, direct, and \nhonest. He is dedicated, hard-working, and technically proficient. Professor B had great \nconfidence in Applicant\u2019s ability to succeed, whether individually or when leading others \non a project. Applicant was \u201cthe single most important contributor to my research group \nin the last ten years.\u201d He is also a great friend, caring father, and an attentive husband. \n(AE 20) \n \nCo-worker A also attested to Applicant\u2019s hard work, dedication, and technical \nabilities. Applicant follows regulations and procedure and is of good character. Co-\nworker A trusts Applicant to do what is best for the company and the country. (AE 20) \n \nCo-worker B has worked with Applicant daily since he joined the company about \ntwo years ago. They are good friends at work. Applicant works hard and has earned the \ntrust of everyone he works with. He is moral and honest. He is a man of integrity. (AE \n20) \n \nPolicies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could rise security concerns. The following \ndisqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred extensive student loan debt while pursuing his education. \nMost of his loans are from his undergraduate years. They came due while Applicant \npursued a doctoral degree. Applicant did not act to defer his loan payments, and could \nnot afford to repay them on his limited income, so they became delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) both apply.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loan debts are ongoing. This precludes application of AG \u00b6 \n20(a).  \n \n \nTo some extent, Applicant\u2019s inability to act on his student loans was a condition \nbeyond his control, given his limited income while furthering his education. However, his \ndecision to pursue a graduate degree and a Ph.D. was his own choice. This is not to \nsay that his educational path was unreasonable, but it was a conscious choice, and not \none without financial consequences. Additionally, Applicant took no action to contact his \nstudent loan creditors during graduate school to arrange deferment or some other \naction on the loans, as he might reasonably have done. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore does not \nfully apply.  \n \n \nApplicant settled and resolved two of his three student loan accounts with \ncreditor N. Applicant researched the debts and was initially told by N that collection on \nthe third debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) had been halted because of another debtor\u2019s bankruptcy \nproceeding. However, documentation from N\u2019s counsel shows that Applicant\u2019s loan is \n\n \n9 \n \n \nnot involved in that proceeding. Thus, SOR \u00b6 1.a is unresolved. Applicant accepts \nresponsibility for it and says he intends to resolve it, as he did with the other debts with \ncreditor N.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is settled and being resolved. Applicant is paying on the debt. He is \nalso paying on several other student loans, not alleged. Importantly, several other of \nApplicant\u2019s student loan debts have been settled and resolved. This evidence adds to \nApplicant\u2019s good-faith efforts to resolve his debts and improve his finances as a whole. \nAlthough SOR \u00b6 1.a is not yet resolved, Applicant undertook serious efforts to engage \ncreditor N to clarify his responsibilities, and he resolved two of his other debts with \nthem. He has stated that he intends to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a. Based on his documented \ntrack record of action with creditor N, I give this assertion credibility. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \nThe student loans at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e became delinquent and were \ncharged off. Applicant learned this when he contacted the creditors. The creditors \ncancelled the debts, and issued Applicant 1099-C forms. The IRS adjusted Applicant\u2019s \ntaxable income on the basis of the cancellations, and, accordingly, then adjusted his \nincome taxes owed. The resulting tax debts are resolved. This documents that the \naccounts are resolved. However, they were not resolved through Applicant\u2019s own good-\nfaith efforts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to them.  \n \nOnly once he earned his Ph.D. in 2015 did Applicant begin earning more than an \neducational stipend. He began working as a university professor in 2015, and also \nbegan paying his student loans in earnest. He began paying his federal student loans in \nDecember 2015, and has paid almost $30,000 towards those accounts since then. He \nearned $80,000 as a university professor from 2015 to 2017, and now earns $90,000 in \nthe defense industry. He now has significant funds in reserve to continue paying down \nhis student loans. Applicant\u2019s finances have significantly improved and there are clear \nindications that his loans are being resolved. Though he has not pursued credit \ncounseling, AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant incurred extensive student loan debt during his many years pursuing \nhis education. His loans became delinquent during this time, when he could not afford to \npay them. He established that many of his student loans are settled and resolved, He \nestablished enough of a track record of good-faith efforts and responsible action under \nthe circumstances. In the defense industry, Applicant is earning an income allowing him \nto continue to pay down his debts, and has access to funds allowing him to continue to \ndo so. I am confident that he will continue to show responsible action towards resolving \nhis student loan debts. Applicant is not required to pay off all of his debts at once, or to \npay them off in any particular way. He need only show that he is taking responsible and \nappropriate documented steps towards resolving his debts. Applicant has done so. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s continued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 9, 2017. On \nJuly 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 15, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On September 25, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 13, \n2019. I was assigned to the case on September 26, 2019. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled, and Applicant testified. Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C were admitted without objection. Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n2\ncorrected some inaccurate information reported in GE 2, GE 3, and GE 4. I received the \ncompleted transcript (Tr.) on December 3, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Sudan. Those facts are set forth in \nthe Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for South Sudan. (GE 5) These \ndocuments are included in the record. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate \ntype of notice used for administrative proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). Usually administrative notice \nat security clearance proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). The facts administratively \nnoticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. (Tr. 14; GE 1) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. He \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.e, and attached three documents to his SOR response. (See \nAE A-C)  \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He was born in Sudan and is a member of the Zaghwa \ntribe. He has been married since 2007, and has two children, ages 8 and 12. Applicant is \nsponsored by a government contractor for a linguist position in Kuwait or Iraq, with his \nemployment contingent on the issuance of a DOD security clearance. He is a dual citizen \nof Sudan and the United States. Applicant\u2019s employer asked him to surrender his expired \nSudanese passport. At the hearing, Applicant avowed that he is loyal to the U.S., the \ncountry that ultimately saved his life. He does not own any property or bank accounts in \nSudan, and only travels with his U.S. passport. (Tr. 58-59, 64-70, 72-73, 80; GE 1, GE 2, \nGE 4) \n \nApplicant left Sudan when he was 19 years old to attend college in the Soviet \nUnion, and was able to avoid conscripted military service in the Sudanese military. He \nobtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988, master\u2019s degree in 1993, and his doctorate in \ninternational law in 1997. He moved to Dubai in 1998. Applicant worked for the \ngovernment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for approximately two years before he \nbecame a partner in other businesses. In 2003, Applicant became a human-rights activist \nin Dubai, after the genocide campaign started in the Sudanese city of Darfur, and the \nSudanese government targeted mainly three African tribes, including his own tribe. He \nworked diligently to establish a network within the international community and inform \nthem of the needless slaughter of innocent people. (Tr. 12, 33-36; GE 2, GE 4) \n \nApplicant soon became a target for the government of Sudan, not only for being a \nmember of the Zaghwa tribe, but also for being a vocal human-rights activist. The \nSudanese government requested that the UAE government arrest and detain Applicant. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nDuring his first arrest in 2008, the UAE security agency held him in jail for three weeks, \nand required him to be interviewed daily for about ten hours each day. He was released \nonly after Applicant\u2019s wife went to the U.S. Consulate in Dubai to seek assistance. In early \n2009, about two months after his release, Applicant was arrested a second time. He was \nheld for ten days in a detention center. He was arrested a third time in 2009.  He was held \nin captivity for five or six months, facing possible deportation to Sudan. During his stay in \njail, U.S. Homeland Security and United Nations (UN) personnel took him to the UN \nbuilding in Abu Dhabi, interviewed him, and he was released from captivity. There was a \nstrong U.S. presence in the Middle East at the time taking action to improve the misplaced \ncitizens of the Sudan situation. (Tr. 37-44; GE 2, GE 4)  \n \nIn December 2009, Applicant arrived in the United States as a political refugee. In \nMay 2015, he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Sudan \nfrom December 2016 to January 2017 to visit his elderly father. Even though it was risky \nto return to Sudan, Applicant maintained daily contact with the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. \nApplicant was not detained or interviewed by the Sudanese government during this travel. \n(Tr. 46-48; GE 1, GE 2, GE 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Sudan.  Applicant \ndenied this allegation since his father passed away on February 26, 2019. (SOR \nresponse; Tr. 56; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s sister, a citizen and resident of Sudan, serves as \nthe Senior Legislative Advisor for the Sudan National Legislative Counsel. Applicant \ndenied this allegation in his SOR response. He admitted at the hearing that his sister has \nbeen employed by the Sudanese government for 25 years, with her last five years of \nemployment with the Sudanese Legislative Council. His sister had been an elected \nmember of the ruling party until the military overthrew the Sudanese government in 2019. \nShe is now barred from government service. Applicant had repeatedly warned his sister \nover the years that there will come a time that she and the corrupt government will be \nheld accountable for their crimes against innocent people. Since the 2019 revolution, \nApplicant admitted that she could be in some danger for her past involvement with the \ncorrupt Sudanese government. He regularly communicates with his sister through social \nmedia, and no action has yet been taken against her. He stated that if she is held \nanswerable for her crimes, as a brother he would be sad, but as a human rights activist, \nApplicant fully understands the possibility that his sister may face charges one day. (Tr. \n51-57, 62-63; GE 2-4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, a citizen and resident of Sudan, and \nserves on the Sudanese Legislative Council. Applicant denied this in his SOR response. \nHe admitted, however, that his brother-in-law had been on the Sudanese Legislative \nCouncil for approximately the last six years, until the 2019 military coup. His brother-in-\nlaw is now working as a lawyer for a law firm in Sudan. He is also barred from Sudanese \ngovernment service. (Tr. 51-57; GE 2-4) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant\u2019s cousin is employed as a police officer in Sudan, and \nhe is also a resident and citizen of Sudan. Applicant admitted this information and also \ndisclosed that he communicates with his cousin weekly through social media. His brother \nis a local police officer, and is not involved in the politics or government of Sudan. (Tr. 51-\n52; GE 2-4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant\u2019s half-sister is a citizen and resident of Sudan.  \nApplicant admitted this allegation and stated that she lives in northern Dafur, which is not \ncurrently a safe place. He met her for the first time in 1997, and again in 2016 when he \ntraveled to Sudan. His contact with her is sporadic. (Tr. 49-51; GE 2-4) \n \nAfter Applicant arrived in the U.S., he started teaching U.S. public policy part-time \nas an adjunct faculty at different universities. He is grateful to have civil rights in the U.S, \nand he is currently involved in human-rights campaigns for Sudan. He feels a moral \nobligation to defend the rights of Sudanese citizens who have been oppressed by the \ngovernment for many years. He intends to continue to be a human-rights advocate not \nonly for Sudan, but for other countries with serious human rights violations. (Tr. 59, 63-\n65) \n \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Sudan \n \n \nThe United States reestablished diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1972, however, \nSudan\u2019s established links with international terrorist organizations resulted in the 1993 \ndesignation of Sudan as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, and the suspension of U.S. \nEmbassy operations in 1996. The U.S. Embassy was reopened in 2002, and remains \nopen today. \n \n \nIn July 2011, conflict broke out between the government and the Sudan People's \nLiberation Movement - North in states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile (together \nknown as the Two Areas), which resulted in 1.1 million internally displaced persons or \nseverely affected persons needing humanitarian assistance. A separate conflict broke out \nin the western region of Darfur in 2003, displacing nearly 2 million people and causing \nthousands of deaths. Fighting in both the Two Areas and Darfur has largely subsided, \nhowever the civilian populations are affected by low-level violence including inter-tribal \nconflict and banditry, largely a result of weak rule of law. The United Nations (UN) and \nthe African Union have jointly commanded a Darfur peacekeeping operation (UNAMID) \nsince 2007. Peacekeeping troops have struggled to address insecurity in Darfur and have \nincreasingly become targets for attacks by armed groups. Sudan also has faced refugee \ninfluxes from neighboring countries, primarily Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, Central African \nRepublic, and South Sudan. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and denial of \naccess by both the government and armed opposition have impeded the provision of \nhumanitarian assistance to affected populations. \n \n \nSudan was a Republic, however, in April 2019, the Sudanese military overthrew \nthe government of President Omar Hassan Al Bashir and established a transitional \nmilitary counsel. The previous government of Sudan concentrated power in the hands of \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nan authoritarian government and the National Congress Party, which maintained nearly \nabsolute political power. There is a national state of emergency in effect across Sudan \nwhich give security forces greater powers of arrest and incarceration. The detention of \nforeigners has been reported and other human rights issues include unlawful or arbitrary \nkilling, forced disappearance, torture, and arbitrary detention. The U.S. State Department \nTravel Advisory for Sudan is:  Level 4 - do not travel.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n   \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a close relationship with an individual \nliving under a foreign government. The mere possession of a close relationship with an \nindividual in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nIf an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential \nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation.  \n \nAs noted, a heightened risk is associated with Sudan with its persistent violence \nand human-rights problems. The evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions are sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nHere, Applicant\u2019s relationship to his extended family members in Sudan is far \ndeeper and more than casual, as previously reported. Applicant maintains frequent and \nregular contact with family members in Sudan, especially with his sister and cousin. After \nconsidering and weighing the evidence, I find that Applicant did not rebut the legal \npresumption of close familial bonds or ties to his family in Sudan. Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith his sister, brother-in-law, cousin, and half-sister leaves him vulnerable to foreign \ninfluence, and creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation and coercion and the \npotential risk for a conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nAn applicant with relatives, financial interests or other substantial \nconnections to a foreign country faces a high, but not insurmountable hurdle, in \nmitigating security concerns raised by such foreign ties. An applicant is not \nrequired \u201cto sever all ties with a foreign country before he or she can be granted \naccess to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-13739 at 4; App. Bd. Nov. 12, \n2008. However, what factor or combination of factors may mitigate security \nconcerns raised by an applicant with relatives in a foreign country is not easily \nidentifiable or quantifiable. Moreover, an applicant with familial or other \nconnections to a hostile foreign country faces a heavy burden in mitigating security \nconcerns raised by such foreign ties. \n \nApplicant\u2019s strong and longstanding ties to the United States raises \nfavorable inferences regarding his suitability. He has no assets in Sudan. None of \nhis family members are currently involved in Sudanese politics or employed by the \nSudanese government. He understands a possibility exists in which his sister or \nbrother-in-law may be held accountable for their past involvement with the corrupt \nSudanese government. If that would happen, he would support the inquiry. The \ngovernment has no burden of showing that Sudan officials have attempted to \nexploit Applicant; however, if such evidence existed, it would cause grave security \nconcerns about foreign influence.  \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. His wife and two children are U.S. citizens. \nAll of his assets are in the United States. His oath of allegiance to the United \nStates, his honesty in self-reporting his foreign connections, and the candor he \nexhibited at the hearing are sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s familial connections to Sudan. He teaches U.S. public policy at different \nuniversities and is grateful to have civil rights. I find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Sudan \nare outweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States. His closest family, life, and assets are in the United States. I find \nthat it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of the United States and the interests of Sudan. There is no conflict of \ninterest, because he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe United States. The above mitigating conditions are applicable \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person and the heightened risk associated with Sudan, Applicant\u2019s \nlongstanding ties and loyalty to the U.S. mitigated the foreign influence security concerns \nat issue.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel  \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant has family members and a friend who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. \nSince 2018, Applicant has worked for the U.S. Army in a war zone as a linguist and has \nwon the praise of his leadership for his excellent services in a dangerous environment. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to mitigate security concerns raised by his family \ncircumstances. Based upon the record evidence as a whole, national security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 12, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in \nconnection with his employment. On August 29, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, \n1960) as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n\n2 \n \nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 31, 2019, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He admitted three of the five SOR \nallegations, with comments for each, a narrative statement, and 11 pages of supporting \ndocuments.  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case in a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), dated December 5, 2019, which included four proposed exhibits \nidentified as Items 1-4. The FORM also included Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice, identified as Item 5. This request is discussed below. A complete \ncopy of the FORM was provided to Applicant. He was given the opportunity to file \nobjections, submit a written response and documents to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by the SOR allegations. Applicant responded to the FORM with \na brief written statement and two documents correcting a mistake in the record regarding \nhis mother\u2019s name.  \n \nI have marked the attachments to Applicant\u2019s SOR answer as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through H and the documents attached to Applicant\u2019s FORM response as AE I \nand J. I have re-marked Items 1 through 4 attached to the FORM as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1-4, respectively. I have re-marked Item 5 as Hearing Exhibit 1. The case was \nassigned to me on January 15, 2020. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nHearing Exhibit 1 is Department Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan). Applicant did not \nobject to this request. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the \nrequest that are supported by source documents, which are official U.S. Government \npublications. These facts are summarized in my Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in my findings of fact and have noted \nhis denials and additional comments. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from \nhis SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Department Counsel\u2019s FORM and \nadministrative notice request, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and the documentary \nevidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan in 1981 and is presently 38 years old. In 1994, \nhe and his family relocated to Pakistan as refugees. He earned a high school diploma in \nPakistan in 2009 at the age of 28. In about 2009, Applicant met a woman online. The \n\n3 \n \nwoman was born in Afghanistan but had lived in the United States for many years, and \nholds dual citizenship with the U.S. and Afghanistan. Applicant and the woman married \nin Pakistan in 2010. Applicant\u2019s wife has three adult children. They were all born in the \nUnited States and hold dual U.S. and Afghan citizenships. Her middle child, age 32, lives \nin Afghanistan, and the two others, ages 34 and 30, reside in the United States. (GE 4 at \n13.) \n \n \nIn January 2012, Applicant returned to Afghanistan while he waited for a visa to \njoin his wife in the United States. After an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, he was \ngranted an IR1 (spouse of a U.S citizen) visa. Applicant entered the United States in \nOctober 2013, about three years after his marriage. He and his wife separated in March \n2017 and divorced in the United States in October 2018. He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in March 2018, at the age of 37. (AE A; GE 4 at 3, 13.) \n \n \nApplicant possesses both a U.S. passport and an Afghan passport. He renewed \nhis Afghan passport in 2015. He traveled to Afghanistan in March 2016 and April 2018 to \nvisit his family there. He reported in his June 2018 U.S. Army counterintelligence security \nscreening interview (Interview) that he does not plan to renounce his Afghan citizenship. \nHe wants to keep that citizenship so that he can travel to Afghanistan on his Afghan \npassport without the necessity of applying for a visa and because he has emotional ties \nto Afghanistan due to his birth there. (GE 4 at 12, 14.) \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army because he could not find \nemployment. However, he failed the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery \n(ASVAB) exam. In 2018, he applied for his current position as a linguist because he was \ndivorced. Prior to starting his work for the U.S. Army as a contractor in October 2018, he \nwas \u201c\u2019in a bad financial situation.\u2019\u201d (GE 4 at 5-6, 8, 11; AE F.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased, and his mother is a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan. He has three sisters who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. All three \nare married and have children. Applicant has other siblings who live outside of \nAfghanistan. Since 2015, he has sent about $200 per calendar quarter to help support \nhis mother, who is a \u201chousewife.\u201d In his June 2018 Interview, Applicant reportedly said \nthat if he worked for the U.S. Government in Afghanistan, he would be concerned about \nthe safety of his mother and one of his three sisters in Afghanistan. He planned to deal \nwith this concern by keeping his work there a secret. He also stated, however, that if his \nfamily was ever threatened, he would not betray his country. He further stated that he \nwould never betray the U.S. or Afghanistan. (SOR answer at 2; GE 4 at 2, 8, 10, 11, 17.) \n \n \nAs of June 2018, when Applicant submitted his SCA and was interviewed by Army \ninvestigators, Applicant reported that he had weekly telephone contact with his mother \nand one of his sisters in Afghanistan. He also reported that he had monthly or quarterly \ntelephone contact with his other two sisters in Afghanistan and monthly telephone contact \nwith the daughter of his former wife, who resides in Afghanistan. (GE 4 at 17-19.) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant has a friend who is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. The friend is a \nsenior executive officer in the Afghan National Army serving in the Afghan Special Forces. \nAs of June 2018, Applicant had monthly contact with this friend. In his SOR answer, \nApplicant wrote that he keeps their friendship very professional and does not discuss his \nwork with the friend. (GE 4 at 12, 16, 21; SOR answer at 3.) \n \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e sets forth security concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nstatement in the Interview that his allegiance to the U.S. was the same as his allegiance \nto Afghanistan. In his SOR answer, he wrote that his response to the security screening \nquestion was misunderstood. He wrote that the security and national interest of the United \nStates are his \u201cpriority.\u201d He also wrote that his allegiance to Afghanistan is just as the \ncountry of his birth. The reason he provided for declaring that the United States was his \npriority is that his future belongs in the United States. (SOR answer at 3.) \n \nCharacter Evidence and Services Provided to the U.S. Army \n \n \nApplicant provided with his SOR answer four character references and three \ncertificates of appreciation, one from his employer and two from the Combined Security \nTransition Command \u2013 Afghanistan. A U.S. Air Force captain described Applicant as the \n\u201cmost valued contributor to our team\u201d and that he has \u201cthe highest level of moral \ncharacter\u201d and \u201ca very trustworthy American.\u201d He also noted that Applicant once put \n\u201chimself at personal risk to physically escort the deceased remains\u201d of coalition forces to \nsafety after an attack in Kabul. A U.S. Army captain wrote that Applicant has been asked: \n\u201cto call and work with high ministerial levels of the Afghan Government due to his ability \nto achieve results and be trusted.\u201d He praised Applicant\u2019s \u201cgreat moral character.\u201d A \ncaptain in the British Army wrote that Applicant \u201chas coordinated multiple security \nmeetings with police commanders and high ranking officials across the security services \nin order to facilitate the successful implementation\u201d of an important security program. A \nU.S. Army major and first sergeant co-wrote a memorandum in which they recommended \nApplicant receive a clearance. They wrote that Applicant \u201cdemonstrates his loyalty to U.S. \nmilitary forces by providing interpretation and translation services to the U.S. military and \ncoalition forces in support of counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan.\u201d They also wrote: \u201cI \ntrust [Applicant] with my life on every mission; his action in supporting the United States \nis a testament to his loyalty to our nation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s employer awarded him a Certificate \nof Appreciation that describes Applicant as one of its \u201cexceptional employees.\u201d(AE B-H.) \n \nAfghanistan  \n \nThe Taliban is a serious challenge for the democratically elected Afghan \nGovernment in almost every province of Afghanistan. It considers itself the rightful \ngovernment of Afghanistan, and it continues to fight for the withdrawal of foreign forces \nfrom the country. The U.S. State Department advises against travel to any area of \nAfghanistan due to terrorism, crime, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict. The \nState Department warns that the security situation in Afghanistan is extremely unstable \nand the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. Extremist groups across the country utilize \na variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a \npublic perception of instability. The presence of more than 20 terrorist organizations in \n\n5 \n \nthe region creates the largest concentration of terrorist and extremist organizations in the \nworld. The country also experiences serious abuses of human rights as well as \nwidespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those responsible for \nhuman rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n\n6 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relatives in Afghanistan, his friend in the Afghan National Army, his \nadmissions in his SOR answer, his FORM response, and the documentary evidence in \nthe record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n\n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nnecessary to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member or \nfriend living under a foreign government. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family and personal \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual connection must be considered. The \nconditions in the foreign country, the nature of its government, and the presence of \nterrorists are important factors to be weighed. The facts in this case establish a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) is established with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.  \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e is the result of a misunderstanding during an interview. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s clarifying explanation in his Answer, the facts surrounding this \nallegation do not give rise to a security concern under Guideline B. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) is also established. Applicant\u2019s connections to foreign persons create a \npotential for a conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or \nsensitive information or technology and his desire to help a foreign person by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. It cannot be concluded with the requisite degree of \nconfidence that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States. Applicant recognizes that he must keep his work for the \nU.S. Army a secret from his family members and others to avoid the risk of endangering \nhis family members. Applicant\u2019s success at maintaining that secret is impossible to \npredict. \n\n8 \n \nSince 2018, Applicant has worked for the U.S. Army and with NATO forces in a \ndangerous war zone in which he has made a significant contribution to U.S. national \nsecurity. His actions constitute important evidence that his ties and sense of obligation to \nthe United States are sufficiently strong that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. The Appeal Board: \n \nhas recognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, \nwhere the applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that \nhis compliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the \ncontext of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had \nmade a significant contribution to the national security. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 05-03846 \nat 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport attempts at coercion or exploitation. Id. \n \nWhen an \u201capplicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high level of \nrisk on behalf of the U.S., [his behavior] constitute[s] important evidence             \nthat [his] ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong \nthat he [could] be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. .\u201c Directive \u00b6 E 2.8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05- 03846 at 6 (App. Bd. \nNov. 14, 2006.) (Applicant\u2019s work as an interpreter in Afghanistan occurred \n\u2018in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a \nsignificant contribution to the national security.\u2019) See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12363 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008).\u201d \n \nISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008) (footnotes omitted). Under this \napplicable authority, AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established with respect to the Afghan relatives alleged in the \nSOR. Applicant\u2019s contacts and communications with these relatives are not casual or \ninfrequent so as to create little likelihood that those relationships could create a risk of \nforeign influence or exploitation. With respect to Applicant\u2019s friend who is a Special Forces \nofficer in the Afghan National Army, the record is incomplete as to the length and history \nof their relationship. However, the fact that Applicant maintains monthly contact with this \nperson supports the conclusion that their relationship is not sufficiently casual to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 8(c). \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility and a security clearance by considering \nthe totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances and applying the \nadjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and \n\n9 \n \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall, commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, especially the security significance of Applicant\u2019s \nexemplary service since 2018 in the U.S. national interests. The security concern set forth \nin AG \u00b6 6 regarding an applicant with a divided allegiance due to his foreign contacts is a \nserious matter in cases such as this. I have weighed the important role linguists play in a \nforeign war zone and the potential for risk to U.S. national security if a linguist could be \ncoerced into helping terrorist organizations opposed to U.S. interests.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his multiple contacts and connections with \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. However, with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging falsification of his SCA, he admitted that his answer to a question was incorrect but denied deliberate falsification. I have treated his response to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor since October 2014. He has been employed by defense contractors since September 2007. He has held security clearance since 2005. (Tr. 42.) Applicant married in August 2005, separated in June 2016, reconciled in February or March 2017, and separated again in January 2018. He has three children, ages 13, 11, and 7, and a stepchild, age 19. He received an associate\u2019s degree in May 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2012. In June 2017, Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Applicant testified he and his wife decided to file a bankruptcy petition to allow them to start with a \u201cclean slate\u201d and remove the burden of indebtedness on their effort to restart their marriage. (Tr. 21- 22.) The bankruptcy petition listed assets of $295,708 and liabilities of $422,090. The debts listed in the petition included two student loans incurred by Applicant in 2002 for $37,000 and $48,000; the mortgage loan on the marital home for $241,000, legal fees of $9,000 incurred by Applicant; legal fees of $14,600",

Applicant has refuted the allegation that he \nfalsified his security clearance application (SCA). He has mitigated the security concern \nraised by his arrest and charge of assault and battery on a family member, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concern raised by his financial problems. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his SCA on April 30, 2018. On July 12, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 8, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 28, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on the same day. On October 29, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for November 13, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses and did not submit any \ndocumentary evidence. I kept the record open until December 2, 2019, to enable him to \nsubmit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November \n26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. However, with \nrespect to SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging falsification of his SCA, he admitted that his answer to a \nquestion was incorrect but denied deliberate falsification. I have treated his response to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2014. He has been employed by defense contractors since September \n2007. He has held security clearance since 2005. (Tr. 42.) \n \n \nApplicant married in August 2005, separated in June 2016, reconciled in \nFebruary or March 2017, and separated again in January 2018. He has three children, \nages 13, 11, and 7, and a stepchild, age 19. He received an associate\u2019s degree in May \n2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2012. \n \n \nIn June 2017, Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. \nApplicant testified he and his wife decided to file a bankruptcy petition to allow them to \nstart with a \u201cclean slate\u201d and remove the burden of indebtedness on their effort to restart \ntheir marriage. (Tr. 21- 22.)  \n \nThe bankruptcy petition listed assets of $295,708 and liabilities of $422,090. The \ndebts listed in the petition included two student loans incurred by Applicant in 2002 for \n$37,000 and $48,000; the mortgage loan on the marital home for $241,000, legal fees \nof $9,000 incurred by Applicant; legal fees of $14,600 incurred by Applicant\u2019s wife; \nmedical bills totaling $12,290, mostly incurred by Applicant\u2019s wife; and credit-card debts \ntotaling $24,650 incurred in Applicant\u2019s name only, but which he attributed to his wife\u2019s \nspending habits. It is not clear from the record whether the two student loans included in \nthe bankruptcy petition were duplicates. They retained one car and the marital home. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was not employed outside the home when they filed their bankruptcy \npetition. The bankruptcy petition listed net monthly income of $6,842 and expenses of \n$6,796. Both debtors received a discharge in October 2017. (GX 6.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant was first hired by his current employer, his annual salary was \nabout $65,000. He has since been promoted several times and his annual salary has \nincreased to about $110,000 (Tr. 39.) \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant saw his stepdaughter looking through mail that had \nbeen delivered to their home. He attempted to take the mail from her, and she accused \nhim of grabbing her arm, spinning her around, and shoving her into the kitchen stove. \nThe sheriff\u2019s deputy who came to the home and investigated the incident determined \nthat there was insufficient evidence to file charges. Applicant\u2019s wife filed a petition for an \nemergency protective order, and the magistrate found the stepdaughter\u2019s testimony \ncredible and issued the protective order. Applicant\u2019s wife then filed charges of assault \nand battery on a family member, and Applicant was convicted. He appealed. In \naccordance with local law, the case was tried de novo on appeal. He was offered a plea \nagreement, which he declined. The case went to trial in August 2018 and was continued \nfor six months, with the stipulation that the charges would be dismissed if there were no \nfurther incidents. The charges were dismissed in March 2019. (SOR Answer, \nEnclosures 1 and 2; GX 2 at 2; GX 3.) Applicant moved out of the house after the \nJanuary incident. He and his wife have lived apart since that incident, but they are not \ndivorced. \n \n \nApplicant testified that the January 2018 incident was the second time his wife \nhad filed false charges against him. According to Applicant, she had filed a petition for a \nprotective order about a year earlier, alleging that he had assaulted her. Her petition \nwas dismissed because Applicant had a tape recorder in his pocket during the \nargument during which she alleged he assaulted her. The recording reflected that \nApplicant\u2019s wife was the aggressive party. Applicant presented no documentary \nevidence supporting his testimony about this earlier incident. \n \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant and his wife joined in a Pendente Lite order providing for \njoint custody of their three children, visitation rights, and allocation of marital debts. \nApplicant agreed to pay his wife $3,311 per month, allocated as follows: $821 in \nspousal support; $1,565 in child support; and $926 in family-debt adjustment. (AX A.) In \nJuly 2019, they executed a consent order on child custody and visitation, superseding \nthe Pendente Lite order and amplifying the conditions for custody and visitation. (AX B.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2018, he did not disclose student \nloans totaling about $38,811 that were reflected as 180 days past due in the credit \nreport from June 2018. (GX 5.) Applicant testified that he understood when they started \nthe bankruptcy process that the student loans would not be discharged. However, he \nremembered that the student loans were included among the debts listed in the \nbankruptcy petition, and he testified that he vaguely remembered seeing a document \nthat led him to believe that the student loans might be included in the debts that were \ndischarged. (Tr. 48-49.) After he was interviewed by a security investigator in November \n2018, he knew that his student loans had not been discharged. (Tr. 55.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was making automatic monthly payments on his \nstudent loans for about three years after he received his bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 51.) He \nstopped making payments around May 2015 because he could not afford them, and he \nhad not resumed payments when he filed his bankruptcy petition in June 2017. (Tr. 55.) \nHe put the student loans on the \u201cback burner\u201d until he received the SOR. He then \ncontacted the loan servicer about an income-based repayment plan. He had not \nreceived a response from the loan servicer by the time the record closed. (Tr. 56-57.)  \n \nAlthough Applicant did not disclose the delinquent student loans in his SCA, he \ndisclosed other derogatory information, including the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and arrest \nfor assault and battery in January 2018. (GX 1 at 37-38, 42-43.) He denied deliberately \nfalsifying or omitting information. He admitted at the hearing that he should have \ndisclosed the delinquent student loans. (Tr. 59.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in June \n2017 and received a discharge in October 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he has past-due \nstudent loans totaling $37,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The security concern under this guideline is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans are recent \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. His \nbankruptcy discharge was more than two years ago, but his current financial situation \nprecludes a finding that his financial delinquencies are unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup and the legal \nexpenses related to it were conditions beyond his control. He provided no evidence \nexplaining the large credit-card debt included in the bankruptcy, except a general \nreference to his wife\u2019s spending habits. Almost all the medical debts were incurred by \nhis wife and may have been due to conditions beyond his control, but he provided no \nevidence regarding the circumstances in which they were incurred. He submitted no \nevidence of efforts to resolve his delinquent debts before resorting to bankruptcy. He \nhas not acted responsibly regarding the delinquent student loans, taking no action to \nresolve them until he realized that they were an impediment to retaining his security \nclearance.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant received financial counseling in \nconnection with his bankruptcy, and the debts, except for the student loans, have been \nresolved by the bankruptcy discharge.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. While a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a legal and \nsometimes prudent remedy for financial problems, it does not constitute a \u201cgood-faith \neffort\u201d to resolve the debts. See ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May 2, 2013). \nApplicant has made no payments on the student loan since his bankruptcy petition, and \nhe did not contact the creditor about resuming payments until he realized that his \nsecurity clearance was in jeopardy. Applicants who wait until their clearance is in \njeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to \ndisclose the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleges \nthat he was arrested in January 2018 and charged with assault and battery on a family \nmember (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a is AG \u00b6 \n16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to . . . \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness . . . .\u201d When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An \napplicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining whether a \nfailure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was \ndeliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that his student loans were included in the bankruptcy \npetition, making him unsure whether they were discharged. He disclosed other \nderogatory information in his SCA, including the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and his arrest for \nassault and battery in January 2018, indicating his effort to be candid. I conclude that he \ndid not intentionally falsify his SCA by failing to disclose the delinquent student loan \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. AG \u00b6 16 (a) is not established. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant for the conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 2.b:  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior . . . ; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing. . . . \n \n \nNone of these disqualifying conditions are established. Although the evidence \nestablishes that Applicant was arrested and charged, it also shows that he was falsely \naccused and that the charges were dismissed. Thus, the evidence as a whole does not \nestablish personal conduct sufficient to raise a security concern. I note that if the \nconduct had been alleged as criminal conduct under Guideline J, it would be mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cno reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense\u201d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n9 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the \nallegation that he falsified his SCA, and he has mitigated the security concern raised by \nhis arrest for assault and battery on a family member, but he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his Chapter 7 bankruptcy and delinquent student loans. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 21, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), and Administrative Guidelines (AG) implemented on June 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed Applicant that, \nbased on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.  The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. The Department of Defense \nOffice of Administrative Hearings (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 19, \n2019, scheduling the hearing for January 14, 2020. The Government offered Exhibits  \n(GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified in his own behalf and presented two documents which were marked AE A and \nB, and admitted into the record without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record \n\n \n2 \n \nopen until January 28, 2020, for additional information. The transcript was received on \nJanuary 23, 2020. The record closed on January 28, 2020. Applicant submitted additional \ndocumentation AE C, which was admitted into the record without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 38, is married and has no children. He obtained his undergraduate \ndegree in 2004. Applicant completed his security clearance application on August 16, \n2017. He has held a security clearance since 2008. He has been employed with his \ncurrent employer since January 2018 as a project analyst. (GE 1) \n  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2010, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017; that he is indebted to the federal government \nfor delinquent taxes in the amount of $675 for tax year 2010; that he is indebted to the \nfederal government for delinquent taxes in the amount of $6,117 for tax year 2013; that \nhe is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes in the amount of $4,554 for \ntax year 2014; that he is indebted to the federal government for taxes in the amount of \n$10,966 for tax year 2015; that he is indebted to the federal government for delinquent \ntaxes in the amount of $5,209 for tax year 2016; that he is indebted to the federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes in the amount of $6,353 for the tax year 2017; that he is \nindebted to the state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $1,056; that he has a charged-\noff account in the amount of $9,870; that that he has a delinquent medical account in the \namount of $138; and that he is indebted for a collection account in the amount of $290.  \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations with the exception of 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j. \n \nApplicant acknowledged his delinquent tax debts, but stated that he has filed his \nincome tax returns for the years in question when he learned about them through the \nsecurity process. (Tr. 16) At that point, he set up payment plans for each of the years with \nthe IRS.  (Tr. 17) He also stated that one account has been charged off and one account \ncannot be located. (Answer) SOR allegation 1.a. \n \nIn 2017, Applicant filed his 2010 Federal income tax return, and he owed $675 for \nthat tax year. He entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in June 2017, but he \nhas not made any payments. (Tr. 22) He also entered into an agreement in 2017 for tax \nowed ($6,117) from 2013. He agreed to pay $225 a month, but the agreement was \ncancelled in 2018. (GE 4) He has not made any other payments. For the tax period 2014, \nApplicant owed $4,554 and in 2015 he established an installment agreement with the \nIRS.  He made about eight payments between January 2016 and June 2016. During that \ntime three checks were dishonored, and by October 2016, Applicant was no longer in \npayment status. (Tr. 25) He had no good reason for not continuing the payments. \nApplicant responded that \u201clife\u201d just happened. (Tr. 25) At the time, Applicant was earning \nabout $84,000 a year. His wife also worked and the combined income was $124,816. (Tr. \n26) Applicant initiated another tax agreement in 2015, which was abandoned by 2018. \nNo payments were made. (GE 5) In May 2017, the IRS initiated a second notice of intent \nto levy. Then, in June 2017, Applicant entered into an installment agreement for a \ncombined 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 tax debt. This was prior to completing his 2017 \nsecurity clearance application. No payments were made. (Tr. 29) The 2016 Federal \n\n \n3 \n \nincome tax return was filed in 2018. Applicant owes $5,209 and has made no payments. \nThe same pattern continued for tax period 2017. In May 2019, Applicant entered into an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS for delinquent taxes stemming from 2010, 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 29) The agreed upon payment was $415 monthly to be \ndeducted from his salary. He stated that no payments were deducted as scheduled and \nno payments made, and he does not understand why that happened. (Tr. 30) He is still \nunder a 2019 payment agreement. (GE 6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to why he waited until 2019 to re-initiate an installment \nagreement for delinquent IRS taxes was humiliation and being humbled. (Tr. 31) He \nadmitted that he has been quite \u201clax.\u201d (Tr. 31) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2018 subject interview, he explained that he was not aware of the \nfiling issue because his wife always handled the finances. He also stated that he did not \nintentionally not file because he thought his wife filed and also set up payment plans. (GE \n2) \n \nAs to SOR allegations 1.b through 1.g, the Federal delinquent tax debts of $6,117, \n$4,554, $10,966, $5,209, and, $6,353, Applicant attached a proof of payment plan. (File) \nHowever, as discussed above each installment plan was ended abruptly and no \ncontinuing payments made. (GE 5, 6) \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.h, Applicant admitted his state delinquent taxes in the \namount of $1,956, and he attached a 2019 proof of payment plan to settle the debt. \n(Answer) He was to pay $385 a month to the comptroller of the state. No payments have \nbeen made. (Tr. 32; GE 7, 8) \n \n Applicant denied the debt in SOR 1.i, a debt for $9,870 because it is charged off. \nHowever, Applicant produced a document that reflected the loan amount was cancelled \nin an IRS Form 1099-C. (AE A) \n \nApplicant denied the medical account in SOR 1.j for $138, because he has not \nbeen able to locate the account and it does not appear on his 2017 credit bureau report. \n(Tr. 33) He has not made any attempts to contact the creditor even though it appears on \na newer credit report. (Tr. 34) \n \nAs to SOR 1.k, a collection account in the amount of $290, Applicant paid the \naccount on August 2, 2019 and provided documentation to confirm. (AE B) \n \nApplicant currently earns about $93,000 a year and he has been consistently \nemployed.  He has not had any financial counseling. He submitted a budget with his \npacket of documents (GE 3), showing a monthly net remainder of $904. He does not have \na savings account. He has not filed his 2018 Federal income tax return but has asked for \nan extension. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant submitted as post-hearing documents an installment agreement and a \n2018 joint filing for that tax year. He is scheduled to make a monthly payment of $415, \nwhich will be automatically deducted from his bank account. (AE C) \n \nAs to state taxes, Applicant submitted documentation that the total debt has been \ntransferred to a collection agency and he made a payment of $215 on January 24, 2020 \ntoward the total delinquent debt of $1,180.90. He averred that consequent payments \nwould be made in the amount of $241 on the 15th of each month and deducted from his \nbank account. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or failure \nto pay annual Federal, state or local tax as required\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n6 \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts are long-standing. He did not file his Federal \nincome taxes for a number years in a timely fashion. He started several installment plans \nwith the IRS, but never continued them. He admitted that he had no good reason for not \nfiling and also that he relied on his wife to handle financial affairs. He stated that he was \njust lax and had no good reason for not paying the taxes. He stated that he learned of the \nissue when he was going through his security clearance process. However, filing income \ntaxes is a basic duty for every citizen.  The issues were discussed in his 2018 subject \ninterview. There does not appear to be any circumstance that occurred beyond his \ncontrol. He has been consistently employed. Applicant stated that he did not file his \nincome tax returns or pay taxes because his wife usually did them and that \u201clife\u201d \nhappened. Thus, from the record, it cannot be determined if he applied any good-faith \nefforts until last year. Without documentary evidence of more efforts, he has not \ndemonstrated a track record and there is no indication that his financial situation is under \ncontrol. He has not received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(a)- 20(d) are not established. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved. Although he promises to address them \nin his new installment agreement, there is little weight given to this information given his \npast history of entering an agreement and not making the payments or just stopping \nabruptly. As stated, he has not received financial counseling and there are no clear \nindications that he will follow through on his payment arrangement with the IRS or the \nstate. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s work career and continuing late tax filings and \ninability to maintain an installment agreement, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness and inconsistency with \npayment plans for federal taxes with the IRS. I conclude that it is not with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 5, 2019, and, more completely, on \nSeptember 25, 2019. She requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 27, 2019. On December 16, 2019, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the \nhearing for January 8, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1-11. All the government exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted documents that I marked Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AE) A, and admitted without objection. I held the record open to afford \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted \nseven documents, which were marked as AE B-H and admitted without objection. The \npost-hearing documents are described in the Findings of Fact, below. DOHA received \nthe transcript on January 16, 2020. The record closed on January 22, 2020. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Nigeria. Department Counsel provided supporting documents that verify, \ndetail, and provide context for certain requested facts. They are detailed in the \nGovernment\u2019s administrative notice filing (AN I) and included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 3.a, 3.b. and 3.c, with explanations. She \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, also with explanations. She \u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, \nthough I construe her explanations as denials. Her admissions and explanations are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. She was born in Nigeria. She married her husband in \nNigeria in 1997, the year she came to the United States, at age 24. She became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2003. Her husband is also a U.S. citizen. They have three children, ages 14, \n12, and 10, all born in the United States. (Tr. 53-57; SCA) \n \n \nApplicant earned master\u2019s degrees in 2012 and 2013. She worked for large \ndefense contractors from 2004 to 2014, with a clearance for those jobs. Since 2014 \nshe has worked for smaller employers in the defense industry, including her own \ncompany, which she opened in 2017. She does not hold a clearance currently. (Tr. 40-\n41, 47, 58-67; SCA) Her husband is a real estate agent. (Tr. 43, 67) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law came from Nigeria to live with her in about 2009. Her \nmother-in-law became seriously ill and Applicant cared for her, straining the family \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfinances. Her mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 3.c) returned to Nigeria at some point, and passed \naway in 2018. (Tr. 42-43, 54-55; Answer) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother and sister, both in their 40s, are citizens and \nresidents of Nigeria. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b). They are both pastors in a church. They also \nmanage small shops. Applicant was in Nigeria in December 2019, shortly before the \nhearing, to bury her mother-in-law. Before then, she was last there in 2017, to bury her \nfather. She went for about two weeks each time. Applicant speaks to her siblings about \nonce a month. (Tr. 54-57, 90-92, 105)  \n \nApplicant noted that she held a clearance before and her Nigerian family \nmembers were not an issue previously. She recognizes that the presence of Boko \nHaram in Nigeria raises a security concern but noted that \u201cwe have nothing to do with \nBoko Haram. . . .They are more of the northern Muslim part. We are Christian south.\u201d \n(Tr. 117) \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant has incurred eight \ndelinquent debts, totaling about $81,755. Three of the debts are tax liens. The debts \nare proven by credit reports in the record (GE 2, 4, 5) and by court documents \nestablishing judgments and liens. (GE 6-11) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,946) is a charged-off credit card with a bank. Applicant \ndocumented that the account has been satisfied. (AE C; Tr. 71-73, 93) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($2,694) and 1.f ($1,719) are judgments issued against Applicant in \n2013 and 2017, respectively, for unpaid homeowners\u2019 association fees relating to a \nrental property. (GE 10, GE 11) Applicant provided documentation that both of the \njudgments were satisfied. (AE E \u2013 AE H; Tr. 84-86, 95-100) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($906) is a debt placed for collection by a cable company. Applicant \ndenied the debt, noting that she has a current account there. (Answer) The debt is \nlisted on her 2017 credit report as being delinquent since 2014. (GE 2 at 8) Applicant \ntestified that she does not recall owing this debt to the company in question. She has \nservice from a different provider now. (Tr. 88, 94-95) She provided no documentation \nof the status of this debt. This debt is unresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a charged-off debt to a large retailer. No amount is alleged, though \nthe Government alleges that the account remains delinquent. Applicant denied the \nallegation. (Answer) The Government\u2019s evidence shows a zero balance on the \naccount. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. 88-90) This account is resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($803) and 1.c ($16,624) are state tax liens entered against \nApplicant in 2016 and 2013, respectively. (GE 7, GE 8) SOR \u00b6 1.d ($57,163) is a \nfederal tax lien issued against Applicant in 2015. (GE 2 at 3) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant owns her home and two rental properties. One of her tenants fell \nbehind on rent when the tenant became hospitalized, in about 2012 or 2013. The \ntenant also \u201ctrashed\u201d the property. Applicant recognized the need to maintain the \nmortgage since it affected her credit, but fell behind. Applicant is trying to repair the \nhome so she can sell it. That home is vacant, and the other one is occupied. She \nattested that the mortgage on the occupied home is paid. She said the current renter \npays $2,100 in monthly rent, and she said she makes a profit after taxes, homeowner \nfees, and other monthly expenses. (Tr. 40-42, 68-71) Applicant attested that she and \nher husband are financially comfortable and are able to pay their monthly bills. (Tr. 67-\n68) \n \nApplicant fell behind on her taxes in about 2014 or 2015. (Tr. 51-53) She and \nher husband jointly file their tax returns on time each year, through an accountant. \nTheir taxes were audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and authorities \nrequested receipts related to her husband\u2019s real estate business. The paperwork they \nsubmitted for the audit was not sufficient. (Tr. 44-45) They hired an accountant to \naddress the audit, but the accountant went out of business. (Tr. 49-50)  \n \nApplicant retained a law firm in 2018 to help her address the tax debts, and paid \nthem $5,000. (AE B) She attested that she was paying the state tax debt every month, \nas directed by her lawyer. She said she pays about $150 or $300 per month towards \nthe state tax debt. (Tr. 73-77, 101-105) Applicant testified that the tax firm told her not \nto make any payments towards her federal tax debt. (Tr. 77-83, 101) However, she \nprovided no documents to establish the current status of either the state or federal tax \ndebts, or that the tax debts are being paid.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s February 2017 SCA included questions asking if, in the past seven \nyears, she had any delinquencies involving enforcement, such as judgments entered \nagainst her liens placed against her property for failing to pay taxes or other debts, or \nhad any currently delinquent federal debt. (GE 1 at 37) Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and \nthereby failed to disclose her judgments, tax liens (both state and federal) and her \nfederal tax debt, as alleged in the SOR.  \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose those debts was \ndeliberate. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant answered the allegation by stating, \u201cI admit but when \nI said NO, I explained that the tax audit was due to my husband[\u2019s] job 1099 and try to \nexplain responding to the question at that time.\u201d (Answer) I interpret this answer as a \ndenial and a reference to her explanations to the interviewing agent. (GE 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SCA also included a question asking for disclosure of delinquencies \nin the past seven years involving \u201croutine accounts\u201d such as charged-off accounts and \naccounts placed for collection. (GE 1 at 37) Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and thereby failed \nto disclose her debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and 1.h. She answered the allegation \nby stating that she was not aware of the debts at that time, and also noted that these \ndebts had been rectified. (Answer) \n \n\n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure . . . to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred several thousand dollars in past-due state and federal income \ntax debt, resulting in tax liens. She incurred judgments for unpaid homeowner fees on \na rental property, and other past-due debts. AG \u00b6\u00b619 (a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to all \ndebts alleged but for SOR \u00b6 1.h, a debt for which no delinquent amount is either \nalleged or established.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are set \nforth under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem, and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  \n \ng) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began several years ago. They are mostly related to \nher rental properties and her husband\u2019s real estate business. Applicant testified that \none of her renters became ill and fell behind on rent. The renter then \u201ctrashed\u201d the \nhome and it now sits vacant. The other rental property is in good standing. The \nmortgages are not alleged, but two of the debts relate to past-due homeowner dues \nand fees. Those debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) are resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.a is also resolved.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s tax debts, however, are not resolved. She testified that she and her \nhusband were audited by the IRS, and that the tax debts relate to her husband\u2019s real \nestate business. They hired an accountant and a law firm to challenge and address the \ntax debts, both state and federal, but provided no documentation that the tax debts are \nbeing resolved. Indeed, she testified that she was advised not to pay the federal tax \ndebt. Her tax debt is ongoing, and continues to cast doubt on her current judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n  \n  \nApplicant began falling behind on her debts when her renters stopped paying \nrent. However, that was several years ago. Her three largest debts are the state and \nfederal tax liens, which total well over $70,000 in past-due tax debt. Applicant did not \nestablish that her debts are due largely to circumstances beyond her control. Nor did \nshe establish that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply.  \n \n  \nApplicant documented that the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f, are paid and \nresolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those debts. Applicant denied the cable debt at SOR \u00b6 \n1.g but did not provide documentation to dispute responsibility for the debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply to it.  \n \n  \nApplicant documented that she and her husband retained a law firm in 2018 to \naddress her large state and federal income tax debts. She did not provide any \ndocumentation to show that those debts are being paid, settled, or otherwise resolved. \nShe did not establish that she has received credit counseling from a legitimate and \ncredible source, or that her tax debts are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply. Nor did she establish, either through the law firm or otherwise, \nthat she has made arrangements with the appropriate state or federal tax authorities to \npay the taxes owed, or that she is in compliance with those arrangements. AG \u00b6 20(f) \ndoes not apply.   \n  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nApplicant failed to disclose any of her delinquent debts on her February 2017 \nSCA. She had been in financial trouble for several years, since her renters began \nfalling behind. This led to the judgments sought by the homeowners\u2019 association, in \n2013 and 2017. She also acknowledged that she knew about the tax liens and tax debt \nsince about 2014 and 2015. Applicant had a duty to disclose those debts on her SCA, \nand did not do so. She also has filled out security clearance applications in the past, \nand has long experience in the defense industry. I find that her failure to disclose the \njudgments and the tax liens on her SCA was deliberate, and that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nApplicant denied the allegation of deliberate falsification at SOR \u00b6 2.b, \nconcerning \u201croutine accounts,\u201d putting the burden on the Government to establish it. \nThe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.h is not established as having been delinquent. Applicant \nasserted that she was not aware that the credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and the cable \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were delinquent. While the accounts were delinquent, I find that the \nGovernment has not met its burden of establishing that Applicant knew that at the time \nshe submitted her SCA and deliberately withheld that information. SOR \u00b6 2.b is not \nestablished.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s interview summary indicates that she volunteered that her federal \ntaxes had been audited in 2009, and that she owed about $70,000 in taxes as of 2014. \nWhile she did not address the judgments brought against her by the homeowner\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nassociation, I conclude that she voluntarily disclosed enough about her financial issues \nto the interviewing agent so that AG \u00b6 17(a) applies.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \n\n \n11 \n \n \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \nGiven the security risks in Nigeria, including the presence of Boko Haram, as \nwell as the concerns about crime, kidnapping, and human rights issues, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s brother and sister, who are residents and \ncitizens of Nigeria. It no longer applies to her mother-in-law, who is now deceased.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister remain in Nigeria. She recently visited them, \nthough her two most recent trips were for the funerals of her father and her mother-in-\nlaw. Her brother and sister are pastors and shop owners. Applicant also testified that \nthey are not affected by Boko Haram because they live in the southern part of the \ncountry, and Boko Haram is active in the north. However, the heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion remains, and AG \u00b6 8(a) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nApplicant has met her burden to establish her \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d She has lived in the United States since she was \n24 years old. Both she and her husband, also from Nigeria, are U.S. citizens, as are \ntheir three children. They all live here and there is no indication that they intend to \nreturn to Nigeria to live. She has worked in the defense industry since 2004, and has \nalways had Nigerian family members. While this is not dispositive, the passing of her \nfather and mother-in-law lessens her connections there. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \n\n \n12 \n \n \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines, B, E, and F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant has had financial problems for a number of years. Most of her debts \ninvolve past-due income taxes, both state and federal, and they have remained \nunresolved for some time. A security clearance applicant with serious tax issues, \nparticularly concerning federal taxes, has a difficult burden to show that she warrants a \nfinding that she is eligible for classified information. While the personal conduct and \nforeign influence security concerns are mitigated, Applicant has not met her burden \nhere. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g:   \nAgainst Applicant   \n \n \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nParagraph 3: Guideline B:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Folks, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \nJanuary 27, 2020 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Abuse), G (Alcohol Involvement), and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant \nsubmitted insufficient information to mitigate security concerns. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 27, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking the continuation of a previously granted security clearance. On June 26, 2019, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the guidelines referred to \nabove. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 8, 2019 (Answer), and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. In his Answer, he admitted all \nof the SOR allegations and provided two corrections regarding the \u201ctime frames\u201d of his \nprior drug use. \n \nOn September 18, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM) that referenced 11 attached documents \nidentified as Items 1-11 and five documents presented for administrative notice purposes. \nA complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. In her FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that he had the \nright to object to the admissibility of Item 11 as unauthenticated. Item 11 is a summary of \nApplicant\u2019s background interview, which was conducted on March 20, 2018. Department \nCounsel informed Applicant that he could alternatively provide corrections and updates \nto the summary of his interview and that if he failed to object to Item 11 or to respond to \nthe FORM, he may be determined to have waived objections to the admissibility of the \ninterview summary and it may be considered as evidence in the case.  \n \nApplicant received the FORM on October 10, 2019, and provided a one-page \nresponse, dated October 22, 2019. In his response, Applicant did not object to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, including Item 11, although he disputed one error in the FORM \nregarding a claim about Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in the past. Based upon the SOR \nallegations, this correction is accepted. Applicant also provided in his FORM response \nadditional information regarding his history of drug and alcohol abuse and his intentions \nregarding future use of both drugs and alcohol. In the absence of an objection, I have \nincluded this document in the written record in this case. I have marked Items 1 through \n11 attached to the FORM as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11, respectively. GE 1 through \n11 are admitted without objection. I have marked the five documents presented for \nadministrative notice (AN) purposes as AN I through V and have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts set forth therein that are of an undisputed nature. The case was \nassigned to me on November 19, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his responses to all of the SOR \nallegations in my findings of fact and have noted his corrections to the relevant time \nperiods referred to in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from GE 3, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to \nthe record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s \nFORM, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record, \nI make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 32, is unmarried and has no children. He has lived with his partner since \napproximately 2006. He earned a high school diploma in 2005 and has taken some \ncollege courses. He has worked for a defense contractor as a functions specialist since \n\n3 \n \n2008. He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) \nin 2009.  \n \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant self-reported to his security officer a one-time experience \nhe had with an illegal drug, ecstasy, in November 2013. He was working as a contractor \nat a DOD agency with eligibility for access to SCI at that time. He wrote to his security \nofficer that his guilt over the use of the drug causes him \u201cmassive anxieties\u201d and that he \nis not a \u201crisk of ever again partaking in such drug use.\u201d He expressed his regret in \nreporting this incident in an untimely manner because it has been \u201can embarrassment \nand tax on my conscience.\u201d After self-reporting this drug use, Applicant disclosed in a \nJuly 24, 2017 interview that he had also illegally used an inhalant commonly known as \nwhip-its on one occasion in January or February 2017. He reported that on that one \noccasion he used 20 or more canisters of nitrous oxide along with a whipped cream \ndispenser to get high. In his Answer, he corrected the approximate date of this drug use \nas November 2016. He also reported in his July 2017 interview using a different inhalant, \nalkyl nitrates, three weeks before the interview. The common name of this inhalant is \npoppers, and it is used as a sexual aid. In his Answer, he corrected the date of his use of \npoppers to have been in about March 2017. He wrote that he does not intend to use whip-\nits or poppers again. In each of the three instances of illegal drug use, the drugs were \ngiven to Applicant without any payment by him for the drug or inhalants. (GE 9 at 1-2; GE \n8 at 5-6; Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant has consistently maintained that his use of alcohol was a contributing \nfactor in each of his three uses of illegal drugs. He has reported that his use of alcohol \naffected his judgment on each occasion. He has a long history of abusing alcohol. He has \nblacked out from excessive alcohol consumption on at least two occasions, first in August \n2011 and a second time in about June 2017. In the past, he has been cautioned by friends \nand a family member about his excessive drinking. Due to his alcohol consumption, he \nhas nearly lost his relationships with close friends, including his long-time partner. He \nstopped drinking for a brief period in 2017 and then resumed. In June 2018, he made a \ncommitment to sobriety. He claims in his FORM response that he is seeking treatment \nfor depression, which he believes is the underlying cause of his alcohol abuse. While I \naccept Applicant\u2019s statement that he is receiving treatment for depression, the record \ncontains no evidence regarding any treatment by an alcohol-abuse specialist, with an \nexception of a one-time session with a counselor. There is no evidence in the record that \nhe has been diagnosed as having an alcohol-abuse disorder. (FORM response; GE 8 at \n3-GE 4 at 2-4; GE 9 at 1.) \n \n \nIn his FORM response, Applicant asserted that he has discontinued contact with \nthe individuals with whom he has used the illegal drug and inhalants in the past. Since \nchoosing to remain sober, he has changed his social group to avoid persons who drink \nalcohol and use drugs. He expressed a desire \u201cto self-correct and heal\u201d from his \ndepression and past abuse of alcohol, and writes that \u201cat current it is my intent to continue \nto focus on self-care and repair.\u201d (FORM response.) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the five allegations in the SOR under Guideline \nE, four of which allege falsifications. Two of these subparagraphs (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.c) \nallege that he falsely denied any illegal drug use in his December 30, 2013 security \nclearance application and falsely omitted his March 2017 use of poppers in his February \n2018 SCA. The other two falsification allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.d) assert that he \nfalsely denied in the 2013 application and again in the SCA that he used illegal drugs \nwhile possessing a security clearance. The earlier application is not included in the \nGovernment Exhibits attached to the FORM, but the record evidence refers to that \napplication and to Applicant\u2019s false denial in the application of any prior drug use, when \nin fact, he used ecstasy one month before he signed the application and while he already \npossessed a clearance. (GE 5 at 8.) \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted that he falsely answered a question in his \nFebruary 2018 SCA that asked if he had \u201cillegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances\u201d in the past seven years or while possessing a security clearance, by failing \nto disclose his use of poppers in 2017. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed his past use of \necstasy and whip-its, but failed to disclose his use of poppers. In his March 2018 \nbackground interview for his pending collateral clearance, he made the same two \ndisclosures and omitted his use of poppers. By admitting the falsification allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d, Applicant has conceded that the use of the inhalant alkyl nitrates, or \npoppers, constitutes substance misuse for purposes of a security clearance adjudication \njust as the use of whip-its is a substance misuse, and his use of poppers should have \nbeen disclosed in his SCA. (GE 11 at 3-4.) \n \n \nThe fifth admitted Guideline E allegation cross alleges the security concerns raised \nin the first two paragraphs of the SOR, which set forth the allegations under Guidelines H \nand G. Applicant is not disputing any of the facts in the SOR, except that he corrected the \napproximate dates of his use of the two inhalants in his Answer. \n \n \nAs a result of a security investigation by another government agency, Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for SCI access was suspended in July 2017 and then revoked on November 30, \n2017. The revocation decision of the other government agency was finalized on January \n30, 2018. (GE 5, 11 at 3.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \u201ccontrol \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n\n5 \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under Guideline H are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and the documentary evidence attached to \nthe FORM establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline H are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n\n7 \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s substance misuse was \ninfrequent. His misuses of an inhalant occurred in November 2016 and March 2017. This \nbehavior occurred after Applicant had advised the Government in his April 2016 self-\nreport of his past use of ecstasy that he had no intention of using illegal drugs again. \nApplicant blames this infrequent drug use on instances of his abuse of alcohol with drug-\nusing friends. While it is significant that Applicant has chosen to live a sober lifestyle, that \ncommitment was made in June 2018, and his commitment was preceded by a brief and \nunsuccessful attempt to remain sober in 2017. I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s use of \nillegal drugs will not recur unless and until he has successfully remained abstinent of both \ndrugs and alcohol for a much longer period of time. Applicant\u2019s recent substance misuse \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his past drug involvement and substance misuse and \nhas provided evidence of actions taken to avoid future abuses. He has established a \nperiod of abstinence since March 2017. He has disassociated himself from drug-using \nfriends. He has not provided a signed statement indicating his intent not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future with the acknowledgement that any violation of that statement would \nbe grounds for the revocation of national security eligibility, as provided in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nHe wrote in his FORM response: \u201cI was also unaware of the mitigation credit condition of \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand in hindsight wish I was aware of the weight of providing such a statement.\u201d This \nstatement demonstrates Applicant\u2019s awareness of the mitigating condition set forth in AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(3), but for some reason he failed to provide such a statement with his FORM \nresponse. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (3) are partially established. \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under Guideline G are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and the documentary evidence attached to \nthe FORM establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline G are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol was sufficiently frequent \nto be a concern to his friends and mother, and therefore is a security concern to the \nGovernment. His commitment to abstinence was made a little over a year before he \nsubmitted his FORM response, which is the most recent evidence in the record on that \nissue. In light of his lengthy history with abusing alcohol, twice resulting in Applicant \nblacking out, insufficient time has passed to permit a conclusion that his abuse of alcohol \nis not recent and is unlikely to recur. His failed attempt to stop drinking alcohol in 2017 \nsupports that conclusion. Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol prior to June 2018 cast doubts \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his pattern of \nmaladaptive alcohol use and has since June 2018 taken action to overcome this problem \nby remaining abstinent. Since he has not received treatment recommendations for his \nalcohol abuse and has only been abstinent for a relatively short period of time compared \nto his many years of excessive drinking resulting in poor judgments and choices, \nApplicant has not clearly established this mitigating condition. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n\n9 \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under Guideline G are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.d establish the \npotentially disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 16(a). His unmitigated security \nconcerns raised in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR regarding his past drug involvement \nand substance misuse and his alcohol consumption are sufficient to be disqualifying, \nespecially since he knew any drug involvement while holding a security clearance would \nlikely be disqualifying. To the extent that such behavior is not disqualifying, the pattern of \nirresponsible behavior supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. Accordingly, the potentially disqualifying \ncondition set forth in AG \u00b6 16(c) is established. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline E are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n10 \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nNeither of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (c) have been established. \nApplicant waited until April 2016 to self-report his 2013 use of ecstasy, which occurred \nabout one month before he submitted his 2013 security clearance application. Also, he \ndid not fully disclose his substance misuse in 2016 and 2017 until he was undergoing an \ninvestigation for his use of ecstasy. His failure to report his use of poppers in his 2018 \nSCA shows a continued attempt to conceal the extent of his substance misuse. Moreover, \nthe offense of concealment was not minor and was frequent. Also, Applicant\u2019s misuse of \nalcohol as well as drugs compounds the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s behavior, creating \ndoubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nWith respect to AG \u00b6 17(d), Applicant has acknowledged his various problematic \nbehaviors, and by finally admitting all of his past drug use, he has taken positive steps to \nchange his uncomfortable history of concealing his past drug use. He is also receiving \ntreatment for his depression, which he believes is the underlying cause of his past abuse \nof alcohol. He has provided little information about his treatment and how long he has \nbeen seeing a therapist. Overall, insufficient time has passed to permit a conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s past behaviors of concealment and abuse of alcohol and drugs will not recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is only partially established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). In particular, I have \ngiven significant weight to Applicant\u2019s relatively young age and the growth and maturity \n\n11 \n \nhe has recently experienced. He has struggled with difficult issues and social pressures \nand is now just beginning to realize that in the adult world serious responsibilities require \nserious adult behavior. I have recognized that his past drug use is limited to three \ninstances of poor judgment, but this occurred over a number of years and should not have \nbeen repeated, especially in light of his security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s history of \nfraudulently concealing his drug use, as recently as his 2018 SCA, makes it impossible \nto conclude with confidence that he will properly disclose any future drug use should that \noccur in response to new or old stressors in his life. It is also too soon to be able to predict \nwith confidence that Applicant will continue to abstain from drinking alcohol and abusing \ndrugs. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, G, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his past actions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2. Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 20, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 6, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 1, 2019. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-4 (Items 1-2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on \nNovember 12, 2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file any objections nor \nsubmit any additional evidence. Items 3-4 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 6, 2020. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the allegations in the SOR. He also provided \nsome explanation for his conduct, as well as a statement of intent not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He is single with no children. He has worked as an \nengineer for his current employer, a federal contractor, since October 2014. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 3)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency from \napproximately January 2006 to December 2018 (I find that the underlying facts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b are consumed within the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a without adding any \nadditional disqualifying conduct. I therefore find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). Applicant listed his use of marijuana from January 2006 to September 2017, in his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) completed in March 2018. He described the \nfrequency of this use as: from 2006-2009, approximately three times a week; from \n2009-2014, approximately less than one time a week; from 2014-2017, approximately 5-\n10 times a year. He stated in his SCA, in response to a question about his future intent \nto use controlled substances, that he \u201cdo[es] not intend to use due to health purposes \n(asthma and respiratory issues) and per requirements of maintaining a security \nclearance.\u201d (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant admitted to a defense investigator that he used \nmarijuana one additional time in December 2018, which post-dated the completion of \nhis SCA. He explained that he used marijuana in December 2018 with a friend who \nsupplied it. At the time, he had not heard the results of his security clearance \ninvestigation and because several colleagues who applied at the time he did had been \ngranted their clearances, he assumed his clearance was denied and he was not \njeopardizing anything by using marijuana. He used while on vacation and when he had \nno professional responsibilities. (Items 2, 4) \n \n \nApplicant is aware that his company has a drug-free policy, which is outlined in \nits employee handbook. His company is unaware of his past marijuana use. He has \nnever received drug counseling or treatment. He continues to associate with friends \nwho use marijuana. As noted above, he provided a written statement expressing his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfuture intent not to use illegal controlled substances, noncompliance of which would be \ngrounds for revoking his security clearance. Since Applicant submitted this case for an \nadministrative determination, I was unable to judge his credibility based on demeanor. \n(Items 2-4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One condition is potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n \n(a) any substance misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on multiple occasions between 2006 and 2018, to \ninclude one use after completing his SCA in March 2018. I find that the above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was frequent from 2006 though 2017, when he \nclaims to have ceased use while he applied for a security clearance. He used one more \ntime in December 2018, when he assumed his clearance had been denied. Given his \n11-year pattern of frequent use and his resumption in late 2018, after he applied for a \nsecurity clearance, his claimed abstinence after December 2018 is not sufficiently \nattenuated to be considered remote. Even more troubling than his frequent use was his \nuse after he completed his SCA. He provided a written statement invoking his intent not \nto use marijuana in the future, but based on his past actions (he also made the same \nstatement when completing his SCA, which he failed to honor), it is difficult to lend \ncredence to such stated intention. Applicant\u2019s short abstention is insufficient to convince \nme that recurrence is unlikely. Additionally, he continues to associate with friends who \nuse marijuana. His frequency of past use and his use of marijuana after stating his \nintent not to use cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.         \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nregularly for approximately 11 years and he used marijuana after completing his SCA in \nDecember 2018. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph    1.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph    1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

(Government Exhibit (GE) 1; GE 2) On June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) \n2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

On December 30, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January \n23, 2020. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered two \nexhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection.

(Tr. 6, 23, 25-26; GE 1) He was \nrecently hired by another DOD contractor. In 1987, he was commissioned in the Air Force. \n(Tr. 8) He was deployed to Afghanistan from August 2005 to January 2006. (Tr. 9) His Air \nForce specialty was information technology communications. (Tr. 10) In 2007, he retired \nfrom the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. (Tr. 8, 23) His highest award was the Joint \nService Commendation Medal. (Tr. 9) He held a security clearance continuously since \n1987 when he joined the Air Force. (Tr. 23-24) In 2013, he was granted access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 24) \n \nIn 1983, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 1987, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree with a major in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 1994, he received \nhis first master\u2019s degree in information systems; in 2002, he received his second master\u2019s \ndegree in military operational art and science; and in 2016, he received his third master\u2019s \ndegree in science and religion. (Tr. 7-8; GE 1) In 1998, he married and his two step \nchildren are ages 34 and 38. (Tr. 12) \n \nSexual Behavior, Use of Information Technology, and Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2 (use of information technology) and 3 (personal conduct) cross-allege \nconduct that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 (sexual behavior).  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant received verbal counseling on at least two occasions \nfor viewing pornographic websites from August 1998 to July 2001. (Tr. 34) On about two \nor three occasions, he used his government-owned desktop computer in his Air Force \noffice to access pornographic websites for 10 to 15 minutes on each occasion. (Tr. 35-\n36, 75; GE 3) It was at the end of the duty day. (Tr. 35) He did not intentionally download \nany pornography on his computer. (Tr. 38) He was verbally counseled and told to stop \naccessing pornographic websites with his government computer. (Tr. 38) The first \ncounseling did not seem to be with serious intent. (Tr. 39) \u201cIt was given to me with like a \nwink\u201d with an instruction to \u201cknock it off.\u201d (Tr. 39) The policy against using a government \ncomputer to access pornography was informal and not well developed at that time. (Tr. \n39-40) He acknowledged that his computer had access to sensitive information, and his \nactions could have compromised that information technology system by exposing it to \nviruses and malware. (Tr. 41) At the time he was accessing the pornographic sites, he \nwas not thinking about the risk to sensitive information. (Tr. 41)  \n \n   \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant received a letter of reprimand in about October 2004 \nwhile serving on active duty for misuse of a government computer. (Tr. 42) He admitted \nthat he accessed pornographic websites on a government-issued computer. (Tr. 42) The \ncomputer he used was a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) computer that was in \na break area. (Tr. 32) The MWR computer was for general access to enable Air Force \nemployees to access their email, and the MWR computer was not assigned to Applicant. \n(Tr. 42) He went to two or three pornographic websites over the course of one day in \nSeptember 2004. (Tr. 42-43) He did not intentionally download any pornography on the \nMWR computer. (Tr. 38) His computer misuse was detected through a computer log that \nwas used to monitor the computer\u2019s use. (Tr. 44) There was no evidence that the \npornography was downloaded or saved on the MWR computer. (Tr. 45) In 2004, he \nviewed pornography at home on an infrequent basis. (Tr. 46) He received some \ncounseling from a licensed counselor to address his pornography issue; however, it was \nineffective. (Tr. 47) The letter of reprimand was for violation of a regulation under Article \n92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). See. e.g., DOD Regulation 5500.7-R, Joint \nEthics Regulation, (Aug. 30, 1993), \u00b6 2-301(2)(d). The reprimand adversely affected his \nfuture assignments, and he was not selected for promotion to colonel. (Tr. 73) During his \nNovember 7, 2007, Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview, \nApplicant said he learned his lesson about misuse of government computers after his \nreprimand in 2004. (Tr. 49; GE 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used an employer-owned computer to view \npornographic websites from about January 2018 to about July 2018. He resigned in lieu \nof being terminated by his employer for this misuse of his employer\u2019s computer. He \nviewed the pornography in his employer\u2019s building in a conference room. (Tr. 50, 55) He \nturned off the virtual private network (VPN) connection to circumvent or bypass his \nemployer\u2019s firewall. (Tr. 59) Switching off the VPN enabled him to access sites his \nemployer would normally block. (Tr. 59) He acknowledged that by turning off the VPN he \nengaged in \u201cunauthorized manipulation of an information system.\u201d (Tr. 59) He also \ndeleted the search logs after he went to the pornographic websites. (Tr. 72) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nApplicant viewed pornography once or twice a month using his employer\u2019s \ncomputer, and he accessed the sites for one or two hours at a time. (Tr. 50; GE 3) He \naccessed the sites during lunchtime or when things were slow at the office. (Tr. 51; GE \n3) He estimated that he downloaded about 1,000 pictures but no videos, and he deleted \nthe pictures within 24 hours after downloading them. (Tr. 53-54) His employer did not find \nany pornography on the computer he used to access pornographic websites. (Tr. 59) He \nsaid the computer he misused did not directly affect DOD. (Tr. 30) His employer\u2019s \ncomputer did not directly access a DOD network; however, this computer did access his \nemployer\u2019s network. (Tr. 30-31) His misuse of his employer\u2019s computer violated his \nemployer\u2019s policies and procedures. (Tr. 58) He committed multiple infractions because \nafter he misused his employer\u2019s computer the first time, and nothing happened, he did \nnot believe his employer was serious about enforcement of prohibitions against accessing \npornography on his employer\u2019s computers. (Tr. 55-57) He resigned from his employment \nbecause he believed it was likely that he would be fired. (Tr. 57) \n \nApplicant received routine annual briefings on security and information systems. \n(Tr. 32-33) Throughout his career, Applicant was aware that he was not permitted to \naccess pornography websites or view pornography using government or his employer\u2019s \ncomputers. (Tr. 31-32) He viewed pornographic websites for pleasure. (Tr. 36) He \nbecame sexually aroused; however, he did not masturbate while viewing the \npornography. (Tr. 37, 52) He did not view child pornography. (Tr. 38) He conceded that \nin the past he had a problem with or addiction to pornography. (Tr. 46-47) Applicant \ninfrequently viewed pornography on his home computer from 2004 to 2018. (Tr. 49) \n \nTheoretically, when Applicant downloaded a pornographic picture onto his \nemployer\u2019s computer, that picture might have contained a virus that could be transferred \nonto his employer\u2019s network. (Tr. 75-76) The virus could be transferred via his employer\u2019s \nnetwork onto a Microsoft Word document or PowerPoint presentation, and in turn, when \nthese items were sent to the DOD, the virus could be downloaded onto the DOD network. \n(Tr. 75-76) Applicant was not thinking about possible penetration of security or creation \nof a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into the DOD network when he was looking at pornography or visiting \npornographic websites using his employer\u2019s computer. (Tr. 77)   \n \nApplicant reluctantly conceded that in the past he was \u201caddicted\u201d to pornography. \n(Tr. 70) His viewing of pornography was a choice, and ultimately, he had the power or \nfree will and could choose not to view pornography. (Tr. 70) He said that in the past he \nhad a compulsion to view pornography, and he \u201cfell into a bondage area.\u201d (Tr. 70)  \n \nApplicant met with his pastor on a weekly basis from August 2018 to about March \n2019, and less frequently thereafter for counseling to help with his pornography issue. \n(Tr. 62-66; SOR response) After July 2018, Applicant viewed pornography on his home \ncomputer on only one occasion. (Tr. 61) He disclosed this viewing to his spouse and \npastor. (Tr. 61) Occasionally his spouse attended the meetings with his pastor. (Tr. 64) \nHis spouse has complete knowledge of his issue with pornography. (Tr. 64) Applicant \ndisclosed his misuse of computers involving pornography to security, coworkers, friends, \npeople at church, and family. (Tr. 60, 66; GE 3) He was not worried about public \ndisclosure of his past problem with pornography because of his success in his endeavors \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nto stop viewing pornography. (Tr. 67-68) He expressed his remorse for his involvement \nwith pornography. (Tr. 83)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nA GS-15, who has known Applicant for 14 years in a professional capacity, \ndescribed Applicant as having excellent integrity and loyalty. (SOR response) His \nstatement supported Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. (Id.) In 2019, he \nreceived an annual merit increase and spot bonus increase from his employer for his hard \nwork. (AE B) \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor has provided counseling to Applicant since July 2018. (SOR \nresponse) He said Applicant is \u201cremorseful, repentant, and stands in low probability of \nimproperly using any PC or network again.\u201d (Id.) He recommended mitigation of \nApplicant\u2019s issues. (Id.) \n \nApplicant described himself as patriotic and loyal to the government. (Tr. 77) \n\u201c[T]here were no security incidents\u201d during his decades of government service. (Tr. 77)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 contains the security concern for sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(d); however, the other \ndisqualifying conditions do not apply. When he viewed pornography on his government \ncomputer, he was on active duty, and he violated a regulation and Article 92, UCMJ. \nThere was no evidence that viewing pornography on his employer\u2019s computer was a \ncrime. He disclosed his involvement with pornography. Applicant was able to stop viewing \npornography. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) and 13(c) are not established. His repeated access to \npornography with a government or employer-owned computer reflected a lack of \ndiscretion and judgment. \n    \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s private viewing of adult pornography on a personal laptop computer or \nother personally-owned media outside the workplace is protected conduct under the First \nAmendment and the liberty interest of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 \n(2003)(discussing right to engage in private, consensual sexual behavior); United States \nv. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803 (2000) (discussing adult pornography \nand First Amendment). His sexual behavior involving viewing adult pornography in the \nprivacy of his home does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) applies. Applicant has widely disclosed his history of involvement with \npornography, and it does not constitute a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. He \nhas not viewed pornography on his employer\u2019s computer since July 2018 demonstrating \nhe has the ability to refrain from viewing pornography in an inappropriate or prohibited \ncontext. Guideline D security concerns are mitigated. \n \nUse of Information Technology \n \nAG \u00b6 39 articulates the security concern for use of information technology: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including: \n \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or denial of \naccess to, an information technology system or any data in such a system; \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized; \n \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information technology \nthat persists despite counseling by management; and \n \n(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, \nthat results in damage to the national security. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 40(b), 40(e), 40(f), and 40(g) apply. Applicant downloaded pornography \nonto his employer-owned computer. He turned off the VPN connection to circumvent or \nbypass his employer\u2019s firewall. This enabled him to access sites his employer would \nnormally block, and constituted an unauthorized manipulation of an information system. \nWhen he was an active duty Air Force officer, he was counseled twice about not using \nhis government computer to view pornography. He subsequently received a letter of \nreprimand for viewing pornography using an MWR computer. He viewed pornography \nusing his employer\u2019s computer in 2018. He was well aware from his information \ntechnology education, background, and training that he was not permitted to view \npornography on a government or employer-owned computer. \n \nAG \u00b6 41 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a lengthy history and \nrepeated violations of policies governing use of government and employer computers. \nHis misuse of his employer\u2019s computer in 2018 is relatively recent. He knew viewing \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \npornography using a government computer and his employer\u2019s computer was improper, \nand he did it anyway. He knew going to untrustworthy websites could compromise a \ncomputer system. There were efforts in 2018 to conceal that activity by deleting the logs. \nUse of information technology security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nAs indicated, in the use of information technology section, supra, there is sufficient \nevidence for an adverse determination under Guideline M. Moreover, his misuse of a \ngovernment computer and his employer\u2019s computer is explicitly covered under Guideline \nM. Applicant has widely disclosed his history of misuse of computers and his involvement \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nwith pornography. He is not \u201cvulnerab[le] to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.\u201d I am confident he would report to \nsecurity officials any attempt by a foreign intelligence entity to exploit him because of his \nhistory of misuse of computers. He has refuted security concerns under Guideline E.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines D, M, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old communication system engineer, who was employed by \na DOD contractor from September 2007 to August 2018. He was recently hired by another \nDOD contractor. He served as an active duty Air Force officer from 1987 to 2007. He was \ndeployed to Afghanistan from August 2005 to January 2006. His Air Force specialty was \ninformation technology communications. He honorably retired from the Air Force as a \nlieutenant colonel. His highest award was the Joint Service Commendation Medal. He \nheld a security clearance continuously since 1987 when he joined the Air Force. Applicant \nhas three master\u2019s degrees.  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant improperly disclosed classified information. He \ndescribed himself as a loyal patriotic American. His promotion to lieutenant colonel, \ndeployment to a combat zone, honorable retirement from the Air Force, and 13 years of \ndedicated employment by government contractors demonstrate a 32-year track record of \ncontributions to the national defense. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. \n14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and commenting that security \nconcerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). At his hearing and during OPM interviews, \nhe candidly and honestly admitted his multiple instances of misuse of government and \ncontractor-owned computers. His detailed and candid descriptions of his pornography-\nrelated conduct and efforts to terminate his involvement with pornography are important \nsteps on the road to rehabilitation.   \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nThe weight of the evidence is against access to classified information for Applicant \nat this time. Prior to July 2001, Applicant was verbally counseled twice and told not to use \na government-owned computer to view pornography. In 2004, he received a letter of \nreprimand for using an MWR computer to view pornography. In 2018, he viewed \npornography on his employer\u2019s computer on multiple occasions. His actions to bypass \nsecurity to access pornography, his deletion of digital evidence that he accessed \npornography, and his history of addiction to pornography increase security concerns. His \nmisuse was detected through security measures; however, once his misuse was \ndiscovered, he voluntarily disclosed additional negative pornography-related computer \nmisuse.   \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. Sexual behavior security concerns are mitigated, and \npersonal conduct security concerns are refuted. Unmitigated use of information \ntechnology systems security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security \nclearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 19, \n2018. On July 16, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 28, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On October 24, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 5. She was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on \nOctober 30, 2019, and timely submitted her response, to which the Government did not \n\n \n2 \n \nobject. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 5 are admitted into \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer and FORM response included documents that I \nadmitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The case was assigned to \nme on December 13, 2019. \n \nOn January 2, 2020 and January 3, 2020, I emailed the parties to reopen the \nrecord in order to afford Applicant the opportunity to provide an updated FORM \nresponse. Applicant timely submitted supplemental FORM responses with additional \nevidence, to which the Government did not object. I admitted them as AE C and D. I \nmarked the emails exchanged about these matters as HE I. I closed the record on \nJanuary 28, 2020. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), her \nSCA (Item 3), and the summary of her security clearance interview (Item 4). Item 4 was \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 4. The Government included in the FORM a copy of Item 4 \nand a prominent notice advising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if she \ndid not raise any objection to Item 4 in her response to the FORM, or if she did not \nrespond to the FORM, then she could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and Item 4 could be considered as evidence in her case. Applicant did not \nraise any objections to Item 4 in her FORM responses or otherwise. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 35, is married without children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2006 from one university and a master\u2019s degree in 2012 from another university. She \nhas been steadily employed full time in her chosen field as a senior consultant since \n2012 by two different employers.1 She has worked for her current employer since 2018. \nShe was granted a DOD security clearance in 2007 when she worked for another \nemployer. The status of that clearance was not addressed in the record. \n \nThe SOR alleged 11 student-loan debts, including four federal loans totaling \n$51,959 and seven unspecified loans totaling $231,047. It also alleged a $134 medical \ndebt. Applicant admitted each of the student-loan debt allegations. She denied the \nmedical debt allegation on the basis that it had been \u201cpaid in full\u201d on an unspecified \ndate. She provided a confirmation number for her payment, but was awaiting receipt of \na letter from the creditor to prove the payment. Each of the alleged debts were \nconfirmed by a 2019 credit report. (Item 2; Item 4 at 2; Item 5) \n \nApplicant attributed defaulting on her student loans to underemployment. She \ntook on significant student-loan debt in 2002 to pay for college and again in 2010 to pay \n                                                          \n1 Although the start date for her first field-related employment is listed as October 2010 in her SCA, it \nappears to be a typographical error. I have assumed a start date of October 2012 based on other record \ninformation. (Item 3 at 14)  \n\n \n3 \n \nfor graduate school. She asserted that student loans were her only option to pursue her \ndegrees. In March 2019, she described her financial situation as \u201cimproving.\u201d In August \n2019, she described her salary as sufficient to enable her to \u201cwork towards restoring \n[her] financial situation.\u201d The record did not specify details concerning her relevant \nincome and expense history beyond the information alleged in the SOR and the \ninformation regarding Applicant\u2019s loan repayment history. In November 2017, she \nreported that her adjusted gross income was $61,551. In November 2019, although she \nheld the same job title, she worked in a higher position with a significantly higher (but \nunspecified) salary than what she earned in 2017. (FORM response; AE B; Item 2; Item \n4 at 2) \n \nApplicant tried to negotiate a loan consolidation for her student loans in 2017. \nHowever, she was unsuccessful because several loans were not eligible for the income-\nbased repayment plan she requested and were \u201cdifficult for her to repay.\u201d She continued \nto work with her loan service providers to repay her student loans. At times, her loans \nwere placed in deferment status, but they still accrued compound interest. At other \ntimes, she made minimum monthly payments. When able, she paid more than the \nminimum. Through documentary evidence, she proved the payments she made from at \nleast April 2017 through January 2020 to two student-loan service providers, one for the \nfederal loans (Provider A) and one for the unspecified loans (Provider B). (FORM \nresponse; AE A, B, C, D; Item 2; Item 3 at 43-46; Item 4 at 2-3) \n \nFrom April 2017 through April 2019, before the SOR was issued, Applicant made \n16 payments totaling $14,031 to Provider A including: two payments totaling $2,252 in \nApril 2017; five monthly payments of $419 from September 2017 through January 2018; \nseven monthly payments from February 2018 through June 2018, of which five were \n$455, and two totaled $2,320; a $357 payment in July 2018; and a $191 payment in \nApril 2019. Applicant made five consecutive monthly payments of $908, as part of a \nloan rehabilitation program, to Provider A from August 2019 through December 2019. \nFrom January 2019 through January 2020, she made 24 consecutive bi-monthly \npayments, 12 of which occurred before the SOR was issued, to Provider B totaling \n$16,690, which included: 10 monthly payments of $1,417; one monthly payment totaling \n$892; and one monthly payment totaling $1,628. (FORM response; AE A, B, C, D; Item \n2; Item 3 at 43-46; Item 4 at 2-3) \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant expressed that she understood the security \nconcerns surrounding financial health. She considers herself a patriot with a deep love \nfor her country. She has served in AmeriCorps. She asserted that she would never do \nanything to compromise the security of the United States. She continues to work hard to \nrepay her student loans in full and believes that her hard work will pay off. Her 2019 \ncredit report revealed no new delinquent debts and two credit-card accounts in good \nstanding with no reported delinquencies over a 60 day period. It also revealed an \nunalleged student-loan collection account that was paid; and an open $17,949 federal \nstudent-loan account with a $143 per month payment in good standing with no \ndelinquencies reported over a 30 day period. (Item 2; Item 4 at 2; Item 5)  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527) \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and her credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nThe following are the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant did not meet her burden to establish AG \u00b6 20 (b). Regardless of \nwhether she provided sufficient documentary proof of payment, I do not find the $134 \nmedical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l to be disqualifying in light of the amount and nature of \nthe debt. The primary concern involves her significant delinquent student-loan debts, \nwhich total over $280,000.  \n \n \nApplicant initiated good-faith efforts to repay her student loans well before the \nissuance of the SOR. She established a meaningful track record of payments to both of \nher student-loan service providers. She is managing her current finances responsibly. \nWhile she is not currently debt-free, her actions, both before and after the SOR was \nissued, demonstrate that she will follow through with her commitment to repay her \nstudent loans in full over time. I do not find that her delinquent student loans cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. ISCR Case No. 15-02903 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in order to \nqualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act \nresponsibly given [her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent \nto effectuate the plan). I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a) and (d) are established, and find \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.l in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has carried her burden \n\n \n7 \n \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

He has never married, but he lives with his girlfriend in their newly purchased home. He does not have any children.

He disclosed his history of marijuana use on his SCA he completed in January 2019, and he admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Tr. 30, 32-33; GE 1) In October 2009, Applicant first started using marijuana during his senior year of high school. He used it with friends on three or four occasions.

On August 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 30, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a. The case was assigned to me and on \nFebruary 10, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \nof hearing, setting the hearing for February 27, 2020.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and \n2, and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-I. I admitted all proffered exhibits into \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. In 2015, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering. He has never married, but he lives with his girlfriend in their newly purchased \nhome. He does not have any children. In 2015, Applicant was accepted into a college \ninternship with a defense contractor. After his college graduation in 2015, he has been \nemployed full time by this defense contractor as an electrical design engineer. He does \nnot currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 25-28; GE 1) \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from \napproximately October 2009 to January 2019. He disclosed his history of marijuana use \non his SCA he completed in January 2019, and he admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Tr. 30, 32-33; GE 1) \n \n \nIn October 2009, Applicant first started using marijuana during his senior year of \nhigh school. He used it with friends on three or four occasions. He did not use marijuana \nduring his college years as he was heavily involved in the university\u2019s Christian student \nfellowship ministry. He resumed his use of marijuana in August 2016 and in July 2017, \nduring vacations he took by himself to State A. He met different individuals from different \ncountries at the hostels he stayed in during these trips. The use and purchase of \nmarijuana was legal in State A. On both occasions he purchased marijuana from a \ndispensary, and he smoked approximately three joints with individuals he met over the \ncourse of each vacation. In July 2018, Applicant and his girlfriend vacationed in State A. \nThey purchased edible marijuana and a couple of joints at the dispensary, and they \nshared their marijuana with other people they met at the hostels. (Tr. 30, 32-38, 45, 51; \nGE 1, GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant was aware that although marijuana was legal in State A, it remained \nillegal under Federal law. He returned to his state of residence where marijuana use is \nlegally prohibited. In about November 2018, he smoked marijuana recreationally with his \nfriend. His last use of marijuana occurred in January 2019, when he smoked a joint with \nhis friend again at his friend\u2019s house. Applicant felt that the use of marijuana added no \nvalue to his life. He finally reached a point where he wanted to make positive changes \nand move forward with his life and career, and he made a decision to never use marijuana \nagain. Shortly after he made that decision, he was notified by his supervisor that he was \none of two employees selected out of 12 individuals who would be sponsored for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 31-32, 39-43, 45-48) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer required him to take a drug test in about February 2019, and \nhe tested negative for all controlled substances. Applicant has used only marijuana and \nnot any other illegal drug, to include the misuse of prescription medication. He has never \n\n \n3 \n \nbeen arrested or received treatment for his use of marijuana. He no longer associates \nwith people who use marijuana. He signed a statement of intent to never use marijuana \nagain, and his co-habitant and friends are very supportive of his commitment. He further \nacknowledged any personal involvement with marijuana would be acceptable grounds for \nimmediate revocation of his DOD security clearance. His supervisor is aware of the \nsecurity concern addressed in his SOR, and he is fully supportive of Applicant. Other co-\nworkers, supervisors, and friends who provided character reference letters were also \naware of his past use of marijuana. In 2018 Applicant received a job promotion and a \nprestigious award from his employer. He recently purchased a house. Applicant feels he\u2019s \nmatured greatly these last few years. (Tr. 29-31, 44-46, 49-50, 52-58, 61)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following is potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about October 2009 to \nJanuary 2019. The above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has used marijuana over a long period of time. He stopped all use of \nmarijuana during his college years, but he resumed the use of marijuana thereafter. He \npurchased and consumed marijuana from a state that had legalized marijuana, although \nhe knew at the time that the use of marijuana was illegal under Federal law. Applicant \nmade positive changes in his life and he realized that marijuana added no value to it. He \nhas been promoted in his career, and he recently purchased a home. He is steadfast in \nremaining drug-free, and his co-habitant and friends are very supportive in his \ncommitment. I find Applicant is sincere with his commitment to remain drug-free. \nApplicant was forthright about his past illegal drug use during his security clearance \ninvestigation, and is unlikely to resume his use of marijuana. He stopped associating with \nfriends who use illegal drugs, and he has abstained from using marijuana for one and \none-half years. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has made positive changes in his life, which are supported by his \npromotion, his recent award, and the selection by his employer for the sponsorship of a \nDOD security clearance. His supervisor continues to support Applicant despite reading \nthe information alleged in his SOR. Applicant is committed to remaining drug-free, and I \nfind his future use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. After evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 9, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November 8, \n2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. The case was \nassigned to me on January 7, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except \u00b6 1.c, which he denied. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He served in the military from 1985 to 1992 and was \nhonorably discharged. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. In 2003, he started an \ninsurance business and was self-employment. He married in 2006 and divorced in 2013. \nHe has two children from the marriage, ages 12 and 11 years old. He also has a 23 year \nold child from a previous relationship, age 23 years old.. He remarried in 2018.  \n \nApplicant worked full time as an insurance agent from March 2003 until November \n2013. His business failed, and he sought other employment. He worked from November \n2013 to October 2014 at two places of employment, but was underemployed. He was \nthen unemployed from October 2014 to September 2018. He was supported financially \nby his wife\u2019s income and personal savings. He began employment with a federal \ncontractor in 2018. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant admitted in the SOR that he failed to file, as required, his Federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2010 through 2017. He admitted he was indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes in the amount of approximately $148,000 for tax years \n2008 through 2012. (Item 2) \n \nIn his November 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed \nthat he also failed to pay his 2009 Federal income taxes because he did not have enough \nmoney from sales commissions, and he did not have taxes withheld from previous \ncommissions. He stated in the SCA that he was engaging a tax relief firm to begin an \noffer in compromise (OIC) with the IRS for his 2009 and 2010 tax debt. He estimated he \nowed $28,000 for tax year 2009 and $37,000 for 2010. IRS documents show that he owed \napproximately $69,968 for tax year 2009. They also show he had not filed tax returns for \n2010 through 2017. He filed his 2018 Federal tax return about a week late and the refund \nhe received was involuntarily applied to a 2005 tax debt. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2004. The documents show he had a debt \nowed to the IRS for tax year 2003 for approximately $6,199. He filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in 2006 and disclosed he owed $42,710 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2003 \nthrough 2005. Both bankruptcies were dismissed prior to completion. In 2009, Applicant \nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy and it was discharged later that year. There is no indication he \nwas relieved of his tax obligations from the bankruptcy discharge. (Items 5, 6) (I have not \nconsidered any derogatory information not alleged for disqualifying purposes. I may \n\n \n3 \n \n \nconsider such information for making a credibility determination, in applying mitigating \nconditions, and in my whole-person analysis.) \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant also stated that he now had a steady job and no longer was \nworking on commissioned-based insurance sales. He increased his withholdings at his \ncurrent job and believed he was on a \u201cpath back to good graces with the IRS.\u201d (Item 3) \nHe said, \u201cBefore I started the insurance business I had never missed any filings or \npayments of my federal and property taxes. I simply did not realize how commission \nbased earnings affected taxes.\u201d (Item 3) He further stated, regarding his 2011 and 2012 \ntax returns, that he was working with a tax relief firm to get them filed and paid. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2019. During \nhis interview he confirmed that he had not filed or paid any taxes from 2009 to the present. \nHe also stated that he was not required to file income tax returns since tax year 2013, \nbecause he did not earn enough money. Applicant has not provided any evidence that he \nwas not required to file Federal income tax returns based on his limited income. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant told the investigator that he had not yet contracted with a tax relief firm \nas he previously stated in his SCA. He said he may eventually use one, but he first needed \nto research the best way to address his tax issue and then choose the right company. He \nconfirmed that he was not on a payment plan with the IRS for his delinquent taxes and \nestimated he owed approximately $128,000 for tax years 2009 through 2012. He told the \ninvestigator he failed to pay his Federal taxes from 2009 through 2012, because he did \nnot have enough money set aside to pay them when they were due. Instead, his earnings \nwere invested in his business. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file his 2010 Federal income tax \nreturn because he was unemployed and no taxes were withheld from his income, and he \ncould not afford to pay his taxes. He estimated he owed about $37,000. For his 2011 \nFederal income taxes, he said his failure to file was because he had medical and health \nissues and was \u201cfrozen from fear from dealing with the IRS at this point.\u201d (Item 4) He \nestimated he owed about $35,000. For his 2012 Federal income tax returns, he explained \nhe did not file because he separated from his wife and was going through a divorce. He \nwas aware he would have to negotiate a settlement with the IRS at some point. (Items 3, \n4) \n \nApplicant completed Government interrogatories in July 2019. In them he \ndisclosed he also owed Federal income taxes for tax year 2008 ($20,000). He confirmed \nhe had not filed Federal tax returns for 2013 through 2017 and provided no evidence to \ncorroborate he was not required to do so. He stated, \u201c2014 through 2017 I don\u2019t believe I \nearned enough to file returns. I am requesting transcripts to get more accurate \ninformation. I filed my first clean return since 2008 this year and [the] IRS kept my refund \nof [$]1,300 so technically repayment has begun.\u201d (Item 4) \n \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant told the investigator that this collection \naccount is for a vehicle that he financed and subsequently wrecked and totaled. He was \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbehind on payments at the time of the accident. His insurance paid the creditor, but the \ncreditor was still pursuing Applicant for the late payments owed. Applicant disagreed with \nthe manner in which the debt is being handled by the creditor, and he has no intention of \npaying it. No evidence was provided to show he has disputed the debt. It is unresolved. \n(Items 2, 4, 8, 9) \n \nApplicant admitted owing the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h. They are \ncorroborated by credit reports dated December 2018 and May 2019. Applicant did not \nprovide evidence that he has paid, has payment plans, or otherwise resolved these debts. \n(Items 2, 4, 8, 9)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to file and pay his Federal income tax returns \nbeginning in about 2009 through 2017. He has other delinquent debts that he has not \npaid or resolved. He is indebted to the Federal Government for approximately $148,000. \nHis repeated failure to have sufficient income withheld each year to pay his taxes, and \nhis decision to reinvest that money in his business shows an unwillingness to satisfy his \ntax debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his Federal tax returns and failed to pay \nhis tax debts for numerous years. He failed to provide evidence that he was not required \nto file for some tax years. He stated in his SCA that he had engaged a tax relief firm to \nhelp him resolve his tax problems, but later admitted during his background interview that \nhe did not do so. He provided no evidence of any efforts he has made to resolve his \nsignificant tax debt. No evidence was provided that he has a payment plan, an offer-in-\ncompromise, or made other arrangements with the IRS. His explanations for why he failed \nto file tax returns are not credible. He had the ability to file them. He may not have had \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmoney to pay, but that was because he did not withhold sufficient income each year to \npay his tax liability, which was within his control. He stated that he used the money to \nreinvest in his business. His explanation that he was unfamiliar with his tax obligations as \na self-employed businessman is also not credible. He failed to provide evidence that he \nhas paid or attempted to resolve the other delinquent debts alleged. He did not provide \nevidence that he has taken steps to dispute any of the delinquent debts. None of the \nabove mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. For numerous years, Applicant failed to comply with the \nlaw when he repeatedly failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns. He repeatedly \nfailed to pay his Federal tax obligations. He owes delinquent taxes and debts that are \nunresolved. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. Ignoring one\u2019s legal \nresponsibilities for years raises questions about his reliability, good judgment, and \ntrustworthiness. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1h.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn November 19, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for a security clearance \nrequired for her employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security clearance. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn August 12, 2019, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the current set \nof adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on January 16, 2020, and convened the requested hearing on March \n4, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled. DOHA received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on March 12, 2020. With her Answer, Applicant included documents in support \nthereof. Without objection, they remained attached to the Answer and were made part of \nthe record. (Tr. 9 \u2013 10) During the hearing, Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B. All \nexhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 13 \u2013 22)  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file her \nstate income tax returns (SOR 1.a) or her federal income tax returns (SOR 1.b) for the \n2011 through 2018 tax years. In response, Applicant admitted both allegations and \nprovided information showing that her state and federal returns for those years were filed \nin September 2019. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and works in an information technology (IT) position for \na defense contractor. She was hired by her current employer in February 2020 after \nworking for two years at a different company that sponsored this request for a security \nclearance. Applicant has worked in the IT industry since 1993. She has associate\u2019s and \nbachelor\u2019s degrees in IT-related fields. She enjoys an excellent reputation in the \nworkplace, and a fellow Marine who has known Applicant for 25 years regards her as \ntrustworthy, hardworking, and of high integrity. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX B) \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps between 1993 \nand 1997. Thereafter, she served part time in the Army National Guard and Reserve until \nretiring in 2018. Applicant first received a security clearance as part of her military duties \nin 1994. (GX 1; GX 2; AX A) \n \n \nAs alleged in the SOR, and as she disclosed in her e-QIP, Applicant did not timely \nfile her state and federal income tax returns for eight consecutive years starting in 2012 \nwith her 2011 taxes. Applicant averred that in 2012, she was forgetful and had difficulty \nconcentrating due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other unspecified \npersonal problems. In early 2013, when she was required to file her 2012 income tax \nreturns, she realized she could not do so until her past-due 2011 returns were filed. As a \nresult, Applicant put off filing her 2012 returns. Applicant continued to not file her returns \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nfor the next seven years because her procrastination \u201csnowballed\u201d into an overwhelming \ncircumstance. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 23 \u2013 25, 30 \u2013 31) \n \n \nIn July 2019, Applicant began the process of resolving her past-due returns and \nunpaid taxes. In September 2019, her state and federal income tax returns for the 2011 \nthrough 2018 tax years were filed. Applicant timely filed her 2019 state and federal income \ntax returns in March 2020. She received refunds for some of the tax years at issue, and \nshe owed additional taxes for other years. All refunds have been issued and all of her \npast-due taxes have been paid. (Answer; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 28 \u2013 29) \n \n \nTo resolve her delinquent tax filing obligations, Applicant enlisted the services of a \nnationally-known tax preparation company. She had previously used that company up \nuntil 2011, when she last filed her tax returns as required. Applicant was aware at all times \nover the last nine years that she could have used that company to file her past-due \nreturns. (Tr. 31) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518)  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file her state and federal income tax returns for eight \nconsecutive years reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that \nis articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required).  \n \nTo her credit, Applicant filed all of her past-due returns and has satisfied any \noutstanding unpaid tax obligations. This supports application of the mitigating condition \nat AG \u00b6 20(g) (the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements).  \n \nI also considered the potential application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). The record does not support this. Applicant \nonly recently resolved her unfulfilled tax reporting obligations after nearly a decade of \nprocrastination. Of particular import is the fact that in 2011, Applicant used the same tax \npreparation service she employed in 2019 to resolve her tax issues. She offered no \nacceptable explanation for why she waited so long to act. Applicant failed to more timely \nact to resolve her tax issues despite her awareness of the readily availability of the tax \npreparation service the whole time. This fact attenuates the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(g) and \nundermines confidence in her overall judgment.  \n \nThe record does not support application of any other mitigating conditions. On \nbalance, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under this guideline.  \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s record of military service and her good performance in her \ncurrent job, as well as the fact that she now is current on her tax obligations are positive \nindications of suitability for a security clearance. Nonetheless, this positive information is \nnot sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s knowing failure over \nseveral years to comply with her tax reporting obligations. Those concerns remain \nunresolved and sustain doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued access to \nclassified information. Because protection of the interests of national security is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 21, \n\n \n2 \n2019, an amended SOR was issued detailing the security concerns under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct.  \n \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn August 26, 2019, Applicant answered the Guideline F allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). (SOR Response) On October 30, 2019, he answered the amended \nSOR. On December 11, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on January 16, 2020.  \n \nSeven Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 7) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 C) \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following the \nhearing to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On February 7, 2020, three \nadditional documents were received and admitted into evidence without objection as Ex. \nD \u2013 F. On March 11, 2020, an additional document was received and admitted into \nevidence without objection as Ex. G. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on January 29, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old quality inspector who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since June 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. His current annual \nsalary is approximately $110,000. (Tr. 47) He married in 2007 and was divorced in May \n2019. (SOR Response) He has two children ages 25 and 20 and two stepchildren ages \n23 and 25. (Tr. 16) He has no child support obligation. (Tr. 34) He is currently living with \nhis parents to save on expenses. (Tr. 25)  \n \nThe SOR alleges a $72,574 student loan collection account (SOR 1.b); a $3,509 \ntelephone service collection account (SOR 1.c); a $1,092 credit card collection debt (SOR \n1.d); an $833 bank credit card collection account (SOR 1.e); and a $155 bank card \naccount (SOR 1.f) in collection. The four debts, other than the student loan obligation, \ntotal approximately $5,500. He has not made any payments on these four debts. (Tr. 28) \nAt the time of his September 2018 enhanced subject interview, he had no information \nabout these debts and speculated that they might have been joint credit cards he shared \nwith his wife. At the time of his subject interview he was arguing with his wife as to who \nwas responsible for a telephone collection debt (SOR 1.c, $3,509). (Ex. 2, Tr. 107) The \ndebt became so large because his then wife had used the account to purchase a number \nof new cell phones. (Tr. 108) He admitted all of the debts in the SOR except for a $155 \ncollection debt (SOR 1.f). That account was removed from his credit record by the credit \nreporting agencies after he challenged the debt. (Ex. G, Tr. 26)  \n \n\n \n3 \nIn July 2014, Applicant and his then wife filed for Chapter 13, Wage Earner\u2019s Plan, \n(SOR 1.a) bankruptcy protection. (Ex. 5) The action was taken in an attempt to save his \nhome from foreclosure and to address delinquent obligations due to periods of \nunemployment and an employment strike that he had experienced. (Tr. 107). He had \nbeen laid off three times and then in 2012, the company experienced a 10-week strike. \n(Tr. 29) The bankruptcy listed $200,000 in assets and $345,000 in liabilities. (Ex. 5, page \n42) His home represented $168,500 of the assets and $129,000 of the liabilities. (Ex 5, \npage 18 and 21) Liabilities included $131,072 in student loans, which included his wife\u2019s \nstudent loans. (Ex. 5, page 43) At the time of filing, Applicant and his wife\u2019s combined \nannual income was $108,000. (Ex. 5, page 63) \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan required $350 payments for the first six months and \nthen $1,075 monthly for 54 months. The plan, if completed, would repay the creditors \n$60,150. (Ex. 5, page 72). (Tr. 32) In October 2017, the bankruptcy was dismissed. (Ex. \n5, page 76) Applicant asserted he had been current on his monthly Chapter 13 payments \nuntil he moved to Australia after separating from his wife. (Tr. 30) He lived in Australia \nfrom June 2017 through March 2018. (Tr. 24) Following the dismissal of the bankruptcy, \nhe made no payments on the obligations listed in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 59) He was required \nto obtain financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. (Tr. 105) No \ninformation was provided as to what he learned in the counseling or the nature of the \ncounseling. \n \nAs reflected in Applicant\u2019s June 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he claimed that $276 weekly was being withheld from his paycheck \ndue to a court-ordered Chapter 13 bankruptcy garnishment. (Ex 1) It was not explained \nwhy there was a Chapter 13 garnishment when the bankruptcy had been dismissed in \nOctober 2017. (Ex. 5, page 3 and 76)  \n \nApplicant asserted there is $70,000 equity in his home, which was purchased in \nJuly 2005. (Tr. 24, 53) During the marital separation, while Applicant was in Australia, his \nwife made a very few monthly payments on the home. (Tr. 24) The home went into \nforeclosure, but was brought out of foreclosure before it was sold. (Tr. 52) During the \nbankruptcy proceeding, the real property could not be divided in the divorce. (Tr. 45) He \npurchased his wife\u2019s equity in the home. (Tr. 77) Following his divorce, the home was not \nin a saleable condition. (Tr. 68) Applicant has been renovating the family home and \nintends to turn it into a rental property. (Tr. 23) Documents presented show Applicant has \nspent $21,900 repairing the home. (Ex. D, Ex. E, Ex. G) He spends most of his disposable \nincome on the renovation, which is nearly complete. (Tr. 28) In May 2019, he resumed \nmaking payments on the mortgage. (Tr. 52) Applicant is current on his $1,653 monthly \nmortgage payments on the property he is renovating. (Ex. B, Ex. C, Tr. 21)  \n \nApplicant obtained student loans from 1992 through 1994. (Tr. 20) Prior to the \nbankruptcy filing, Applicant asserts he made payments on his student loans, but stated \nthere were also periods of deferments, forbearances, and non-payment. (Tr. 54) As of \nJanuary 10, 2020, he was paying $185.80 every two weeks per court-ordered \ngarnishment to address his $72,000 student loan obligation. ((Ex. A, Tr. 19, Tr. 27, and \n\n \n4 \nTr. 55) The garnishment went into effect in late 2019, and his pay statement shows that \nonly two payments totaling $369.93 had been made as of the hearing. (Ex. A, Ex. 56)  \n \nIn October 2005, Applicant was charged with Aggravated Sexual Assault on a \nchild, a first degree felony. (Ex. 3, page 19, Ex. 4) It had been alleged he had touched his \ngirlfriend\u2019s daughter\u2019s private areas while bathing the child, then 10 years old. (Tr. 89) He \nand the girl\u2019s mother were living together at the time. Applicant denies any inappropriate \nconduct and asserts the girl was old enough to bathe herself. (Tr. 92) After a few months \nin therapy, the girl admitted to her therapist that she not been molested. (Ex. 97) This \ninformation was brought to the attention of the prosecution. In March 2007, the action \nagainst Applicant was dismissed by the state, citing \u201cOther, Specify: In the interest of \njustice.\u201d (Ex. 3, page 40) \n \nAt the hearing, it was suggested Applicant might want to send documentation as \nto the current status and any payments made on his delinquent obligations. (Tr. 109) \nInformation was received challenging the $155 bank card disputing on this credit report. \n(Ex. G). No documentation related to the other delinquent accounts was received \nfollowing the hearing.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n5 \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n\n \n6 \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nApplicant admitted the delinquent obligations in the SOR except for a $155 \naccount. The record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about \nthe possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant has established that two court-ordered \npayments totaling less than $400 have been taken from his pay to address his student \nloan obligation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are numerous, recent, and remain unpaid. He did not submit evidence of any \nconditions beyond his control that contributed to his financial delinquencies. His divorce \n\n \n7 \nwas a condition beyond his control, but there is no evidence that it contributed to the debts \nalleged in the SOR. His divorce did not cause his student loan delinquency. He asserted \nhe received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy proceeding, but failed to submit \nevidence of counseling or what he had learned from that counseling. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) \nnor AG \u00b6 20(d) can reasonably apply without some progress toward resolving his old \ndelinquencies. He has disputed the legitimacy of a single $155 delinquent account, which, \nif it was the sole debt in question, would not be of security significance. He asserts he is \nmaking payments on his delinquent student loan, but the only corroborating evidence \nshowed that less than $400 in court-ordered payments has been made. The more \npayments an applicant has made, the more likely he will continue the repayment \nagreement to completion. One or two payments by garnishment shows a start has been \nmade to address the debt, but is not as persuasive as having made six months or more \nof voluntary payments.  \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that he has paid each of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to show that he has a plan to resolve his \ndebts and that he has taken significant steps to implement his plan. This he has not done. \nToo many unanswered questions exist about his present financial situation. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not sufficiently mitigated. However, I do not find \nagainst Applicant as to the filing of bankruptcy because financial circumstances over \nwhich he had no control (unemployment and multiple layoffs) resulted in him seeking \nbankruptcy protection. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n \nDepartment Counsel seeks to establish that Applicant was involved in conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations due to him being charged in October 2005, with aggravated sexual assault on \na child, a first degree felony. It had been alleged he had touched his girlfriend\u2019s daughter\u2019s \nprivate areas while bathing her. Applicant denies any inappropriate conduct. After a few \nmonth of therapy, the girl confessed that she had not been molested. This information \nwas brought to the attention of the prosecution. In March 2007, the action against \nApplicant was dismissed by the state, citing \u201cOther, Specify: In the interest of justice.\u201d  \n \n \nI conclude the state was in the best position to determine what had actually \nhappened in 2005, and the state dismissed the charges in the interest of justice. AG \u00b6 17 \n(f) \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d \n\n \n8 \napplies. The burden of proof to establish a disqualifying condition under this guideline \nwas not met.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F and Guideline E are \nincorporated in the whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. However, Applicant \nfailed to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his financial \ncircumstances and his judgment and reliability. In short, the file lacks sufficient evidence \nto establish that he paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, disputed, or otherwise \nresolved his delinquent accounts. The record lacks corroborating or substantiating \ndocuments and details to explain his finances. \n \nApplicant was first made aware of the Government\u2019s concern about his delinquent \nobligations during his September 2018 subject interview. In July 2019, he was made \naware of the specific debts in question when he received the SOR. Since that time, he \nhas provided documentation that he has paid less than $400 on his delinquent \nobligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts concerning \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He has not established his suitability \nfor access to classified information. The decision to deny a clearance at this time should \nnot be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of \ntrue reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, but is \n\n \n9 \nbased on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence \npresented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not warranted, but \nshould Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the \nfuture, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. \nFavorable consideration would be given to additional months of compliance with payment \non his student loan. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted. \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid, it is whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhere the state chose to dismiss the sexual misconduct charges in the interest of justice, \nthe personal conduct security concerns were not established.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in \u00b6 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and a master\u2019s degree in 2014. He never married and has no children. He was employed by a federal contractor from August 2011 to August 2017. He was then unemployed from August 2017 to November 2017. He worked one week in November 2017 for a federal agency and left because it failed to disclose the parking requirements and costs. He was unemployed from November 2017 until he was hired by his current employer, a federal contractor in April 2018. (Items 2, 3, 4) The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,971. Applicant admitted owing all but the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (past due $740). All of the SOR debts are corroborated by credit bureau reports dated May 2019 and April 2018. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2018 and August 2018. He was confronted during the first interview with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which was past due at the time. Applicant could not recall any delinquencies on any of his accounts. He was given an opportunity to provide documentation regarding the delinquent account, but did not do so during the first or subsequent interviews to corroborate his disagreement.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 8, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on January 7, \n2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Items 1 through 6 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on March 4, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in \u00b6 1.d. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2014. He never married and has no children. He was employed by a federal \ncontractor from August 2011 to August 2017. He was then unemployed from August 2017 \nto November 2017. He worked one week in November 2017 for a federal agency and left \nbecause it failed to disclose the parking requirements and costs. He was unemployed \nfrom November 2017 until he was hired by his current employer, a federal contractor in \nApril 2018. (Items 2, 3, 4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,971. Applicant \nadmitted owing all but the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (past due $740). All of the SOR \ndebts are corroborated by credit bureau reports dated May 2019 and April 2018. Applicant \nwas interviewed by a government investigator in July 2018 and August 2018. He was \nconfronted during the first interview with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which was past \ndue at the time. Applicant could not recall any delinquencies on any of his accounts. He \nwas given an opportunity to provide documentation regarding the delinquent account, but \ndid not do so during the first or subsequent interviews to corroborate his disagreement. \n(Items 3, 4) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2019 answer to the SOR, he attributed his financial problems \nto having two knee surgeries in the past two and half years and a one-week hospital stay \nfor pneumonia. He stated that he has adequate health insurance from his employer, but \nwas liable for a portion of the surgeries and hospital stay that were deemed necessary by \nhis doctors. In 2018, he lost three months of work due to his surgery, which created a \nfinancial burden for him. Working overtime was not available until approximately April \n2019. Applicant indicated that he is taking advantage of overtime opportunities, which he \nsees as a long-term solution to him resolving his financial obligations. He indicated that \nhe will continue to pay his accounts.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($25,739) \nthat became past due in April 2018, and charged off in June 2018, is no longer delinquent. \nHe provided a document from the collection division of the creditor dated August 2019 \nthat says a repayment agreement is confirmed, and Applicant agrees to make 49 monthly \npayments of $514 with the final payment due in August 2023. The outstanding default will \ncontinue to be reported to the credit bureaus until the agreement is satisfied. Collection \nactivities will continue if Applicant fails to fulfill the agreement. Applicant provided a letter \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfrom the creditor dated July 27, 2019, authorizing a payment to be processed in July 2019. \nApplicant did not provide any other documents to corroborate he has made any other \npayments and is in compliance with the agreement. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from the creditor for the charged-off account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($9,862). It was dated August 2019 and stated: \u201cApplicant is making payments \nagain on the following account. Last payment processed on July 26, 2019.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant did not provide any other documents to corroborate that he has continued to \nmake payments on this debt. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided a settlement offer from the creditor for the charged-off account \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,283) dated July 2019. It stated that when Applicant completed payments \nof $900, due in August 2019, and $650, due in September 2019, the debt will be settled \nin full. Applicant did not provide any documents to show he paid these amounts and the \ndebt is settled. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided a document from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($740 past due, with \na total balance of $2,476). This was a loan from 2015. Applicant paid the debt in July \n2019. This debt is resolved. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided a payment agreement from the creditor for the collection \naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,347). It required Applicant to make bi-monthly payments \nof $336 in August and September 2019. The payments were to be received no later than \nthe due dates. Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to corroborate that he \nmade the payments as required. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided medical documents to substantiate his medical issues, but not \nthe specific amounts that he was required to pay that he stated impacted his finances. He \ndid not provide any information regarding his current finances, such as his  income; \novertime pay; savings; investments; expenses; or other financial information to show he \nhas the ability to repay his debts. He did not disclose whether he maintains a budget or \nhas participated in financial counseling. He did not explain why he failed to contact his \ncreditors until after he received the SOR and was on notice that his finances might be an \nissue when he was interviewed in July 2018. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that have not been paid or resolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed all of the debts alleged in the SOR, except the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, which he denied because he paid it. Applicant provided documents to show \nhe contacted the creditors for the remaining SOR allegations. However, the documents \ndo not confirm that he has made payments toward the delinquent debts, only that he has \nagreements to pay them in the future. One letter from August 2019, substantiated \nApplicant had started to make payments again on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to show he has continued to make payments beyond \nthat date. His delinquent debts remain recent. Without specific information about his \ncurrent finances and ability to repay his delinquent debts, I am unable to conclude that \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubts on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment and \nmedical bills he was required to pay that were not covered by insurance. These \ncircumstances were beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant \nmust provide evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nstated that he had health insurance, but was required to pay for things his doctors \nprescribed. He did not provide specific information as to the amount he was required to \npay and its impact on his finances. Applicant did not provide information on why he failed \nto contact his creditors until after he received the SOR. He failed to provide corroborating \nevidence that he is making payments in accordance with any agreements or settlement \noffers he has with the creditors. There is no evidence he has participated in financial \ncounseling. He did not provide specific evidence about his current finances other than he \nis now earning overtime pay and will be able to resolve his debts. Applicant provided proof \nthat he resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to that debt. None of the above \nmitigating conditions apply to the remaining SOR allegations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He has been employed since April 2018. He failed to \nmeet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 29, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 25, \n\n \n2 \n \n \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 17, 2020. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits. There \nwere no objections and the Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted into evidence. Post-\nhearing, Applicant provided Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted into evidence \nwithout objection (Hearing Exhibit III). DOHA received the hearing transcript on January \n28, 2020.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibits I and II, which were written \nrequests that I take administrative notice of certain facts about Iraq and Jordan. Without \nobjection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this \ndecision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights \nproblems in Iraq and Jordan.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nThe Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.b. There was no objection and it was \namended as follows:  \n \nYour mother-in-law and extended family are citizens of Iraq and residents \nof Jordan. (Tr. 9-11) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in the SOR \u00b6 1.a, and he both admitted and \ndenied parts of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He was born in Iraq where he attended high school. He \nattended the Iraqi Military College and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in military science. He \nthen attended the Iraqi Police College and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice. \nHis attendance at the Military College was considered military service, and he graduated \nwith a military rank. He was subject to recall to military service, if needed. When he \ngraduated from the Police College in 2003, he began working for the Iraqi government \npolice force. He married in 2008 and has no children. (Tr. 20-22; GE 1, 2) \n \nIn 2003, Applicant was part of the Iraqi security forces. After the invasion of Iraq \nby Coalition Forces, the Iraqi security forces were sent home. Because there was no \nofficial Iraqi government at the time (for about six months), Applicant was paid an \nemergency salary by the United States to provide police protection for the Iraqi people. \nHe continued to work with the U.S. security forces and provided bodyguard protection for \na U.S. General in 2004 and 2005. (Tr. 73-85) \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn 2006, while supporting the Coalition Forces, Applicant was kidnapped by a \nmilitia group because of his efforts to rid areas of terrorist groups within Iraq. Applicant \nwas blindfolded, handcuffed, beaten, and put in the trunk of a vehicle where he was \ntransported to a different location. He was accused by his captors of working with the \nCoalition Forces. At one point, he was left alone in a room and used his military training \nto remove the handcuffs, but injured his wrists while doing so. He escaped from the room \nwhere he was held captive and knew if he was found he would be killed. Applicant was \nafraid for his safety. He found a driver who took him to a village and the sheik there \nprovided him protection, medical care, and transportation to his sister\u2019s resident. Because \nhe was being accused of working with the Coalition Forces, he knew his family was in \ndanger. He warned his family and asked them to bring him his passport, which they did. \nHis father gave him money so he could escape the country. Applicant did not trust the \nIraqi government to protect him. Applicant fled Iraq through Syria to Jordan. (Tr. 22-36) \n \nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother was working for the United Nations in Iraq. He \nwas kidnapped and is presumed dead. Her family has never heard from him again. That \nsame year, Applicant and his wife were taking her mother to hospital in Iraq when the \nvehicle they were driving was attacked. His wife was hit in the head with shrapnel and \nsurvived the attack as did her mother. After this incident, his wife, her mother, two \nbrothers, and two sisters fled Iraq to Jordan. His wife\u2019s family remain citizens of Iraq and \nare residents of Jordan. Her father is deceased. Her mother is a homemaker. Her brothers \nare engineers. One works in private industry and the other works in a government position \nthat verifies people\u2019s educational credentials. One sister is a teacher and the other works \nin the accounting field. (Tr. 41-45, 57-62; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nAfter fleeing Iraq, Applicant stayed in Jordan as a refugee from 2006 to 2008. He \nthen applied to immigrate to the United States. He and his wife married in August 2008 \nand immigrated in December 2008. They both became naturalized citizens of the United \nStates in 2014. Applicant legally changed his name in 2014, because he wanted to follow \nthe American culture and have his name reflect a common American name, and so he \ncould start a new life. He also changed it for security reasons. He is aware that there are \nstill militias in Iraq who cultivate hate. (Tr. 36-41, 45, 62, 66-68) \n \nApplicant and his wife have regular contact with her family in Jordan. They visited \nthem two or three times in Jordan since they immigrated to the United States. Their most \nrecent visit was in 2017. (Tr. 41-45, 57-62; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2017 security clearance application, he stated that he has \nrenounced his Iraqi citizenship since becoming a U.S. citizen. His Iraqi passport has \nexpired and he does not intend to ever renew it. GE 1 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was a dentist in Iraq. She worked as a dental assistant in the \nUnited States from 2009 to 2015. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, and did not \nwork. She recently took the national dental boards to be certified and licensed as a dentist \nin the United States. (Tr.41-42, 48-49) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, four brothers, and three sisters are citizens and residents of \nIraq. Two brothers are married, and his three sisters are married. All are citizens of Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. Two of his sisters are teachers and the other works in a \nbank. Three of his brothers are jewelers and one is a student. His mother is a homemaker. \nApplicant has no current information about his family in Iraq beyond 2015. (Tr. 55; GE 1, \n2, 3) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant applied for refugee status for two of his brothers to immigrate to \nthe United States. In 2014, he applied for the rest of his family to immigrate. Their \napplications are still pending. One of his brothers died of cancer, and in 2015 the other \ncame to U.S. He stayed for about a month and was homesick. His father was sick and \nhis parents wanted his brother to return to Iraq. Applicant warned his family that if his \nbrother returned to Iraq he would not be permitted to return to the United States. Applicant \nwas concerned about his brother\u2019s future in Iraq. He told his family that if his brother \nreturned to Iraq, Applicant would cut ties with the family. His brother returned to Iraq in \n2015, and Applicant has not had any contact with any family members since then. \nApplicant testified that he will not visit his family in Iraq. If they chose to visit him in Jordan \nor Kuwait, he would agree. Applicant\u2019s wife also does not have contact with his family in \nIraq. (Tr. 49-54, 70-73; GE 2, 3,) \n \nApplicant stated that he does not hate his family in Iraq. If they were to immigrate \nto the United States, he would welcome a relationship with them. However, his concerns \nare with Iraq, and if his family lives there, he will not have contact with them. He does not \ntrust the Iraqi government and many of its people. (Tr. 53-54, 70-73) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was a jeweler and had a small factory in Iraq. He also had a \nhouse and some land. His father told him the property was worth about $50 million. \nApplicant believes his father was confused about the value of the property and its \nconversion to U.S. dollars. Applicant contacted a real estate agent in Jordan to determine \nthe actual value of the property, if it were sold. He provided a document from the real \nestate agent with the estimated value of the property as $950,000. According to Islamic \nlaw, one-eighth of the amount would go to his mother. The remaining amount would go \nto the children, with the males receiving twice as much as the females. (Answer to the \nSOR) Applicant has no information about whether or not the property has been sold \nbecause he has no contact with his family. If the property was sold, he would likely inherit \na share, but noted he had a big family so it would be divided accordingly. (Tr. 62-66) \n \nApplicant stated that in 2003, as part of the Iraqi military, he was working against \nthe United States, but he never fought against U.S. forces. After the invasion, he worked \nwith U.S. security forces. (Tr. 73-85) \n \nApplicant worked as a role player employed by U.S. defense contractors from April \n2009 to April 2010. He has employment as a linguist with a defense contractor pending \nthe disposition of his security clearance. The terms of his employment are that he will not \nbe sent to Iraq. However, Applicant said he would acquiesce and go to Iraq if the United \nStates Government ordered him to do so. As a former military officer, he would follow \n\n \n5 \n \n \norders. Applicant was also a self-employed limousine and truck driver for a time. He and \nhis wife intend to remain in the United States. They do not own property in the U.S. They \nhave no assets in Iraq or Jordan. All of their assets are in the United States. Because he \nwas kidnapped and almost killed in Iraq, he continues to be concerned for his safety in \nIraq and has no intention of returning. (Tr. 45-48, 52-53, 85-88; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nApplicant provided a character letter from a former senior deputy minister in Iraq \nnow living in the United States. He worked with Applicant from 2003 to 2004. He noted \nthat Applicant was working as a police officer and was involved in important missions. \nApplicant worked with the senior deputy minister\u2019s team, who were in charge of protecting \nhim and other high profile visitors from the Coalition Provision Authorities in Iraq. He \ndescribed Applicant as a dedicated professional with high ethical standards. Applicant \nwas trusted during a time when Iraq was going through a difficult period. Applicant willingly \nperformed his duties under difficult circumstances. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest.  \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Iraq \nand Jordan. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, \nboth directly and through his wife. The disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and \n7(e) have been raised by the evidence. Applicant does not have any financial interests in \nIraq. His speculative inheritance of property in Iraq, if sold, does not amount to a \nsubstantial financial interest that could subject him to exploitation or a personal conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6 7(f) does not apply.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq and Jordan. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable \nto government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, three brothers, and three sisters are citizens and residents of \nIraq. He has not had contact with any of them since approximately 2015. He does not \nintend to visit them or have contact with them as long as they remain in Iraq. He does not \nknow anything about their lives since he terminated contact with them. AG \u00b6 8(c) applies \nto his family in Iraq.  \n \nApplicant and his wife maintain contact with her family in Jordan. His wife \nfrequently talks with them and they have visited her family in Jordan. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not \napply to them.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives, who are citizens \nand resident of Iraq and Jordan. Applicant has had no contact with his family in Iraq. He \ncut ties with them because they remain in Iraq. He would only renew contact with them if \nthey were not living in Iraq. Due to his kidnapping and torture while in Iraq, he intends \nnever to return, unless ordered to do so. Applicant and his wife moved to the United States \nin 2008 and became U.S. citizens in 2014. His wife has recently taken the national boards \nto practice dentistry. They are committed to remaining in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s family in Jordan primarily works in the private sector, except for one brother, and \nthere is no indication that they have close ties to the government. The brother works in \nan administrative position in a government office. Applicant is fiercely aware of the \ndangers in Iraq, hence his intention never to return. The fact he has not had any contact \nwith his family minimizes the possibility that they could be used to manipulate or coerce \nhim. He does not trust the Iraqi government and many of its people. There is sufficient \nevidence to find that it is unlikely Applicant would be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of his family or his wife\u2019s family and the interests of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies.  \n \nApplicant served as a police officer prior to the United States\u2019 presence in Iraq. \nAfter the fall of the Iraqi Government, he served with the Coalition forces providing \nprotection for a deputy minister and high visibility visitors. Because of his support and \nwork with the Coalition Forces, he was kidnapped and tortured, eventually fleeing Iraq. \nApplicant has no loyalty toward Iraq. He changed his name to embrace the culture of the \nUnited States and for his security. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty to the United \nStates through his past work as a role player for a defense contractor. Although \nApplicant\u2019s wife has family in Jordan, the evidence supports that Applicant\u2019s loyalty is to \nthe United States, and he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant supported Coalition Forces in Iraq. As a consequence of that work, he \nwas kidnapped, tortured, and fled Iraq. He immigrated to the United States in 2008, and \nhe and his wife became citizens in 2014. Applicant has embraced the American culture \nand changed his name. He does not have contact with any family members in Iraq, which \nminimizes potential security risks. He has contact with his wife\u2019s family in Jordan. Except \nfor one brother, who has an administrative position with the Jordanian government, there \nis no indication that any of his in-laws are in positions that may make it likely Applicant \nwould have to choose between his wife\u2019s family and the interests of the United States. \nThe complicated state of affairs in Iraq and Jordan places a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign family members and his wife\u2019s do \nnot pose an unacceptable security risk. Applicant\u2019s ties and loyalty are to the United \nStates where he and his wife live. He has met that burden. Applicant mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns for multiple tax \nyears when they were due, and he did not pay all of his federal and state income taxes \nwhen they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant decided that he needed to rectify his tax issues in about 2015. He \ncontacted the IRS and his state taxation authority. He gathered his documents as best \nhe could, and he purchased the software to file the tax returns on his own. He paid the \nstate $901 in 2015, which was applied to his 2010 taxes. He filed his 1995 through 1997 \nand 2009 through 2011 state and federal income tax returns in 2017. He paid the state \nmore than $1,600 in 2018 to pay his tax debt in full. He filed his 2012 through 2015 \nfederal and state income tax returns in May and June 2019. From September 2019 to \nJanuary 2020, he paid the back taxes owed the IRS. He has filed all federal and state \ntax returns and paid any taxes owed on time since tax year 2016. All required federal \nand state tax returns are filed, and all taxes paid.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto file his tax returns and pay his taxes when required raises questions about his \njudgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. I found Applicant to be \nhonest and truthful, but lax about his legal requirement to file his tax returns and pay his \ntaxes in a timely manner. I am convinced that he has learned a valuable and costly \nlesson, and that all future returns and taxes will be filed and paid on time. Security \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence and honorable military service. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old. He served in the military from 1981 to 1987 and was honorably discharged. He earned two associate degrees. He never married and has no children. He has worked for defense contractors throughout his civilian career. (Tr. 20- 22) Applicant testified that his mother passed away in early 2014 and all of the debts alleged in the SOR occurred around that time through approximately May 2015. He inherited his mother\u2019s house and had a period of unemployment from September to December 2014. He testified that these factors had an impact on his finances. He indicated that he kept up with his bills until he got a job, but then had to relocate, which required him to take care of the house he inherited, which was in another state from where he was living. He said he also rents a residence in a third state, where his girlfriend lives and he visits. He provides his girlfriend financial support.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 25, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 15, 2020. The Government \n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through E. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were admitted into \nevidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 24, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He served in the military from 1981 to 1987 and was \nhonorably discharged. He earned two associate degrees. He never married and has no \nchildren. He has worked for defense contractors throughout his civilian career. (Tr. 20-\n22) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his mother passed away in early 2014 and all of the debts \nalleged in the SOR occurred around that time through approximately May 2015. He \ninherited his mother\u2019s house and had a period of unemployment from September to \nDecember 2014. He testified that these factors had an impact on his finances. He \nindicated that he kept up with his bills until he got a job, but then had to relocate, which \nrequired him to take care of the house he inherited, which was in another state from where \nhe was living. He said he also rents a residence in a third state, where his girlfriend lives \nand he visits. He provides his girlfriend financial support. (Tr. 22, 30-32) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2018. In \nSection 26, which inquired about his finances, he disclosed he had debts that were turned \nover to collection companies, charged off, or have been or are 120 days past-due. He \nlisted in the SCA the following debts that are alleged in SOR and the approximate amount \nowed: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$4,000; 1.c-$2,000; 1.e,-$1,000; 1.i-$700; and an additional debt not \nalleged in the SOR. For each debt he stated that he was laid off from a high paying job \nand has not had sufficient income to pay them. He indicated he was investigating each \ndebt. Regarding action he had taken to resolve each debt, he stated:  \n \nI have not taken any action, so I will try to pay one dollar a year for the next \nseven years. After that it will be removed from my credit. Till then I will \ndispute it until it is removed from my credit report. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2018. He \nwas asked about the debts owed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($8,008), 1.e ($1,465), and 1.i ($745) \nthat he had disclosed on his SCA. He acknowledged each debt, stating that he intended \nto satisfy the debts in the next six months via a payment plan, if it is determined that the \naccount belonged to him and the amount owed was accurate. With regard to the debt he \ndisclosed in his SCA in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($4,483), he stated that this was for a credit card and \nhe intended to satisfy it within a year through a payment plan. He acknowledged to the \ninvestigator the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,934), explaining this was for an apartment rental \nfrom 2015, and the landlord was uncooperative. Applicant had engaged a credit \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncounseling service in September 2018, and he was going to have it investigate the debt, \nand he would pay it if necessary. He was confronted by the investigator with the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,453) and 1.h ($953), and he acknowledged he had experienced financial \nissues in 2014 and intended to have his credit counseling service investigate these debts \nand pay them, if necessary. He stated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was for a personal loan. \n(GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in May 2019. He was asked to \nprovide information about the debts subsequently alleged in the SOR. He stated he was \ndisputing all of them, but did not explain the basis of his disputes. (GE 3) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($8,008), \n1.b ($5,385), 1.e ($1,465), 1.f ($1,453), and 1.h ($953). With regard to these debts, \nApplicant stated that the three credit bureaus did not provide him evidence that he signed \nup online or by mail for any of these accounts alleged in the SOR. He said he began \ndisputing the SOR accounts in 2018. He was not aware of the accounts because he had \nnot checked his credit report in approximately four years. He further stated in his answer: \n \nThese debts showed up at the worst possible time for me as my mother had \njust passed away, and was-and still am supporting three (3) households. I \ntried to work with some of the debtors and creditors, but they only wanted \nthe money back, which I did not and still do not have. (Answer to SOR).   \n \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($4,483). In his answer to the SOR, he \nstated that he disputed this debt and received a letter from the collection company, which \ntold him it had acquired the debt from the original creditor. Applicant stated: \u201cNothing was \nsent to me showing that I ever opened a credit card with the original creditor. I have been \ndisputing this charge for a year and still nothing has been found with my signature.\u201d \n(Answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,934). He stated in his answer to the \nSOR that this debt is from an apartment complex where he lived in 2015. He stated: \u201cI \nwas unable to pay this one complex once despite the fact that I otherwise consistently \npaid my rent on-time and in full.\u201d He stated he had heated arguments with persons in the \napartment office. He believed the landlord was uncooperative and unwilling to work with \nhim. He said the corporate office refused to return his phone calls in spite of his best \nefforts to settle the debt. (Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. In his answer to the SOR, he said that he \nreceived two letters from the collection company after he began disputing the charge. He \nstated:  \n \nBoth letters wanted me to send copies of contracts, bills, or statements \nshowing the amounts I owed despite the fact that I was disputing these \ndebts as not even belonging to me. I tried to point out that I would not have \nthis documentation if the debt was not mine. They did not send me anything \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthat showed I signed up for a credit card from [Credit Card Company A]. I \nhave been disputing this charge for a year and still have not received \nanything that shows I signed up online or by mail for this credit card. \n(Answer to SOR) \n \n \nIn the above statement, Applicant says he would not have the documentation \nabout the debt if it was not his, which confirms he was aware of it and it belonged to him.  \nAt Applicant\u2019s hearing, he was asked about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The testimony is as \nfollows:  \n \nAJ: Is that your debt? \n \nApplicant: No. \n \nAJ: Really? \n \nApplicant: I have had no proof sent to me. \n \nAJ: Okay. \n \nApplicant: I have had no credit agreement sent to me that I requested.  \n \nAJ: Okay, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking. I\u2019m asking is that your debt? \n \nApplicant: No. No. \n \nAJ: Did you have an account, let\u2019s go back, did you have an account with [Credit Card \nA]? \n \nApplicant: Not that I can recall. \n \nAJ: Is that a yes or a no? \n \nApplicant: No. \n \nAJ: So, you never had an account with [Credit Card A]? \n \nAJ: No. (Tr.35) \n \nApplicant further testified as follows: \n \nDepartment Counsel (DC): So, I noticed that on your [Applicant] Exhibit C the bank, the \nbank statements are being sent to [Applicant\u2019s name] at [Applicant\u2019s address] in State A. \nIs that your address? \n \nApplicant: Yes. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nDC: So, have you not been receiving bills from when this credit account was opened in \nabout, looks like on the 4th of 2016. \n \nApplicant: I don\u2019t recall it at all.  \n \nAJ: I can\u2019t hear you, sir.  \n \nApplicant: I don\u2019t recall it at all. \n \nDC: So, where did these come from, the copies that we have in your exhibit? \n \nApplicant: These came from [collection company]. \n \nDC: And how did you get them specifically? \n \nApplicant: I\u2014they came after I requested a letter\u2014I sent a letter requesting a copy of a \ncredit agreement signed by me. They sent them to me.  \n \nDC: Okay. So you\u2019re saying it looks like the bill that you selected included in [Applicant] \nExhibit C go[es] back to November 2014. So, is it your testimony from November 2014 \nuntil now you\u2019ve never received any of these in the mail? \n \nApplicant: 2014 is too long ago, so no, that I recall.  \n \nAJ: I\u2019m sorry, what does \u201ctoo long ago\u201d mean? \n \nApplicant: Too long ago for my memory. \n \nAJ: Too long ago for your memory? \n \nApplicant: Yes.  \n \nAJ: Okay. But how about the ones that were received after that? \n \nApplicant: 2016, I don\u2019t know what mail I got back in 2016.  \n \nAJ: Okay. Where are you looking at, Ms.---So, your testimony is you never had an account \nwith [Credit Card A]; you never received anything, bank statements, any\u2014you asked \n[collection company] to provide you documents, which did they? \n \nApplicant: They didn\u2019t send me signed credit agreements, I mean.  \n \nAJ: I didn\u2019t ask that. Did they provide you documents? \n \nApplicant: Not the documents I requested, no.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAJ: Did they\u2014I\u2019m going to ask one more time, did they provide you any documents?  \n \nApplicant: Yes, they provided me documents.  \n \nAJ: Okay, and what did the documents\u2014these are in your [Applicant] Exhibit C?  \n \nApplicant: Yes.  \n \nAJ: Okay, so you wanted \u2013you do understand [collection company] is the collection agent \nfor [Credit Card A]; correct? You understand that?  \n \nApplicant: Yes, ma\u2019am.  \n \nAJ: Okay. And that your debt was verified by the collection attorneys; you saw that?  \n \nApplicant: They verified something.  \n \nAJ: Okay, Well, I\u2019ve got a document that says it. Okay. \n \nDC: And you are [Applicant\u2019 name] at [Applicant\u2019s address]. \n \nApplicant: Yes. (Tr. 35-38) \n \n \nApplicant then testified that his mother was living at the above address before she \npassed away. He was living at a different location where he was working at the time. \n(Tr.38) \n \nAdditional Testimony: \n \nDC: So that was my next question, where were you working then? \n \nApplicant: In 2014, I was up in City W, State B.  \n \nDC: Okay. \n \nApplicant: I was a contractor for 15 years.  \n \nDC: Okay, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve reviewed these statements that [Credit Card A] sent you \nbecause they\u2019re all charges in [Applicant\u2019s address] and [City W, State B], which is \nconsistent with where you were at the time from what you just told me. Is that right?  \n \nAJ: Can you repeat that, DC, nice and loud. \n \nDC: Sorry. In the documents that [Applicant] has provided with Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, \nspecifically it appears that [Credit Card A] sent him copies of the credit card statements \nfor 2014. And when I look at the charges that are on his credit report, or, I\u2019m sorry, on that \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncredit card in November of 2014 there are charges in both [City W, State B], and \n[Applicant\u2019s home address], which would appear to be consistent with the two places \n[Applicant] had domiciles during that time. Which is why I was asking about where he \nwas. And he confirmed he was in [City W, State B]. Is that correct?  \n \nApplicant: Yes, ma\u2019am. \n \nDC: So, am I understanding correctly that notwithstanding your review of the charges on \nthe credit card that these appear to coincide with where you were living and the address \nthat coincides with the house that you own now, that these were not your charges, and \nthis card is not your credit card? Is that your testimony?  \n \nApplicant: Not without a signed--- \n \nAJ: No. I want you to answer the question.  \n \nApplicant: No. \n \nAJ: I know you want a signed whatever, but are these your charges on your credit card? \nYou are under oath?  \n \nApplicant: Not that I remember.  \n \nAJ: Okay, All right. \u201cNot that I remember.\u201d But you were living in [City W], as you testified, \nand [Applicant\u2019s address]. (Tr. 39-41; GE 1) \n \nAt this point in the hearing, the documents provided were reviewed.  \n \nAdditional testimony:  \n \nDC: I\u2019m looking at his C. \n \nAJ: Yes, Oh, I see, right here. Okay. \n \nApplicant: Yes, they are mine. They are mine. If they are, they are. Okay. \n \nAJ: Well, that is not what you just testified to, sir. (Tr. 41) \n \nAdditional testimony:  \n \nAJ: Okay, I just want to make sure. And you say you don\u2019t remember that. And then you \nsaid, oh, maybe\u2014did you have something else you wanted to say on that one, sir?  \n \nApplicant: The biggest thing is if it is or is not mine I would like to point out the age of the \noriginals that---. (Tr. 42-43) \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false testimony when he denied that he had an \naccount with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \nApplicant further admitted that the debt did belong to him, but the statute of \nlimitations had run and in his state any debt older than four years was unenforceable. \nApplicant was asked to provide additional information about the debt and he stated: \n\u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is not resolved. (Tr. 43-44; GE 1.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he does not intend to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and plans \nto let it fall off his credit reports. (Tr. 71-74; AE D-Item 2)   \n \nApplicant was asked about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He testified the account \nbelonged to him. He said he will either make a payment arrangement to resolve it or have \nit removed from his credit report. He said he will work to resolve it because he has a \nchecking account with the same creditor, and he does not want that account to be closed. \nHe said when he receives his income tax refund he will see about a payment plan or a \nsettlement agreement. This debt was validated by the creditor. (Tr. 61-65; AE C-Item 7) \n \n \nApplicant was asked about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He testified it was his debt, but \nhe did not intend to pay it. He intended to wait until it was removed from his credit report \nin two years. Per his request the debt was validated by the creditor in June and November \n2019. (AE C-Item 4) He testified that the debt he owed to the apartment complex for \nbreaking his lease in 2015 that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was removed from his credit report. \nHowever, he provided as part of his answer to the SOR, a June 2019 document from the \ncreditor that validated the accuracy of the debt. (Answer to SOR-Exhibit L) Applicant did \nnot pay this debt. He testified that he does not intend to do so. (Tr. 48, 53-60; AE C-Item \n5) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f had validated that he owed the \ndebt. He stated it was for an unsecured loan, and he has not had time to make a payment \narrangement. He stated he intended to pay this debt. (Tr. 65-66; AE C-Items 5 and 8) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g that was incurred for an \nemergency room visit in August 2013. He received a letter validating the debt in June \n2019. He testified he did not know why he did not pay the debt, and he does not intend \nto do so. He will wait for it to drop off his credit report in two years. (Tr. 68-71; Answer to \nSOR-Exhibit M) \n \n \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h belonged to him. The debt is unpaid. (Tr. \n60-61; AE C-Item 6) Applicant was then asked about the debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He \ntestified that the debt belonged to him, but it would be removed from his credit report in \ntwo years, and he did not intend to pay it. He testified that he had an account with the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and that he used the account, but did not know anything else about \nit. He received a letter in November 2019 from the creditor validating the debt. (Tr. 46-48; \nAE C-Item 6) \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nAll of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \ndisclosures in his SCA; admissions made during his background interview; responses to \ninterrogatories; his SOR answer and exhibits attached; AE and Items attached; credit \nreports from June 2018 and May 2019; and Applicant\u2019s testimony.  \n \nApplicant continues to maintain three households, one of which belongs to his \ngirlfriend. He testified he contributes about $3,000 a month toward maintaining his \ngirlfriend\u2019s residence where he stays about twice a month. His primary residence that he \ninherited is paid for, but he pays about $1,000 for its maintenance and other expenses. \nThe third residence is located near his work. He shares the residence, and he estimated \nhe pays about $800 a month. He does not have a budget. He has not had financial \ncounseling. He has about $30,000 in a pension plan. His current salary is about $120,000, \nwhich he began earning about 18 months ago. Before then, he earned about $80,000 \nannually. He has no savings. He explained he has not been able to pay his delinquent \ndebts because he did not have the money. He attributed his financial problems to a period \nin 2014 when he was unemployed and his mother passed away. He is waiting for some \nof the debts to be removed from his credit report. He believed having the debts removed \nfrom his credit report after seven years would provide him a better credit appearance. (Tr. \n66, 74-82) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n10 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwilling to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $27,405 that began \naccumulating in approximately 2013. Applicant does not intend to pay many of the debts. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a four-month period of unemployment \nin 2014 and the passing of his mother around the same time. He has nine delinquent \ndebts. He has not made an effort to repay them. He does not intend to pay most of them. \nSome he intends to wait until they are no longer on his credit report and potentially \nunenforceable due to the statute of limitations. Many of the debts were validated at \nApplicant\u2019s request, but he still has not made an effort to pay them. Applicant\u2019s debts are \nrecent and ongoing. Based on his attitude toward his financial obligations and failure to \nresolve any of them, I am unable to find it is unlikely financial issues will recur. His \nbehavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a four-month period of unemployment \nin 2014, his mother\u2019s passing, and maintaining three households. His period of \nunemployment and his mother\u2019s passing were beyond his control. Maintaining three \nhouseholds is within his control. For the application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not. Despite disclosing some \ndebts on his SOR and having others validated, he has not made an effort to pay any of \nthem. He does not intend to pay most of them, and he is waiting for them to be removed \nfrom his credit report after seven years. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has participated in financial counseling \nand that there are not clear indications that the problem is under control. He did not \nprovide evidence he has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \n \n \nApplicant denied each debt alleged in the SOR and then disputed each debt. He \nprovided no evidence that he had a valid explanation for his dispute, and after the debts \nwere validated, he failed to resolve them. AE \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He was aware he had delinquent debts, but decided he \nwas not going to pay them and instead disputed them all. When some were validated, he \nstill refused to pay them. He testified untruthfully when he denied he never had an account \n\n \n13 \n \n \nwith the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e, until he was confronted with his own evidence, and then \nbegrudgingly admitted owing the debt. He has decided he will not pay most of the debts. \nHe will look into paying one debt because he does not want his checking account closed \nwith the same creditor. It has been six years since Applicant was unemployed. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and untruthful testimony raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. He has an unreliable financial track record and has not met his burden \nof persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn August 15, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn August 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On \nAugust 29, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3)    \n \nOn November 7, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 20, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for January 22, 2020. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. During the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant offered seven exhibits; \nthere were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 16-21; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE G) I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for additional time to submit documentation. On January 31, 2020, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing. I received four post-hearing exhibits, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. (AE H-AE K) The record closed on February 21, \n2020. (Tr. 55-56, 65-66) \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.a, and she \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.

(Tr. 7-8, 25) She has been employed \nby the same employer or a predecessor employer of her current employer since 1996. \n(Tr. 24-25; GE 1) In 1988, she graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) She completed three \nyears of college, and she has not received a degree. (Tr. 7) She has not served in the \nmilitary. (Tr. 7) She was married from 1987 to 1989, from 1992 to 2004, and from 2004 \nto 2008. (Tr. 8; GE 1) Her children are ages 20, 25, and 31. (Tr. 9) She has custody of a \nfour-year-old child. (Tr. 50) She has held a secret security clearance since 2008, and \nthere is no evidence of security violations. (Tr. 23-24)   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant was not unemployed or under employed in the previous 10 years. She \ndid not disclose any circumstances beyond her control that prevented her from paying \nher debts. She works one full-time and one part-time job to maintain her home and \nvehicle. (Tr. 23) For the last several years, she has received $3,000 to $4,000 each year \nfrom her part-time employment. (Tr. 28-30) She actively supports a high school and a \nlocal youth football organization. (Tr. 23) \n \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $33,645 as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $33,001. \nAbout 10 years ago, Applicant borrowed about $35,000 using a line of credit option on a \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \ncredit card to renovate her basement after it flooded. (Tr. 22, 30-32, 34, 64-65) She made \npayments for a time, and then the creditor increased her interest rate without notifying \nApplicant. (Tr. 22) The interest rate went from 4.9 percent to 27.9 percent. (Tr. 31) She \ndenied that she missed a payment. (Tr. 31-33) The creditor was unwilling to accept a \npayment for the amount of her previous payments. (Tr. 22) The creditor demanded a $900 \nmonthly payment and would not accept a $400 payment. (Tr. 22, 34, 36) The balance \nwas about $25,000 in August 2013. (Tr. 34-35) In November 2015, a collection agent took \nover the account. (Tr. 37) She did not receive correspondence from the collection agent, \nand she did not contact the collection agent. (Tr. 37-38, 52) In October 2019, Applicant \ncalled the original creditor, and the original creditor told her the account is closed because \nof the age of the debt. (Tr. 22, 37-38) Moreover, the creditor did not have a record of the \naccount. (Tr. 22, 37-38) She acknowledged she was responsible for the debt; she was \nwilling to pay it; and she simply did not know who to pay or how to pay it. (Tr. 42-43, 53) \nAfter the hearing, she contacted the collection agent, and on January 27, 2020, the \ncollection agent agreed to settle the debt for $8,500. (AE J) On January 27, 2020, she \npaid the creditor $2,550, and on January 29, 2020, she paid the creditor $6,000. (AE K) \nThis debt is settled and resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege that Applicant has two delinquent medical accounts for \n$251 and $393. Applicant said she paid both debts in 2018. (Tr. 43-44) On January 22, \n2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b wrote that on October 30, 2018, the debt was \n\u201cpaid in full.\u201d (AE I) On February 11, 2020, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c wrote that on October \n30, 2018, the creditor received a payment for $393, and the debt was \u201cPAID IN FULL.\u201d \n(AE H) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $94,000. (Tr. 45) She files her tax returns. (Tr. 52) She \nmaintains $1,000 to $3,000 in her bank accounts. (Tr. 46) Her monthly mortgage payment \nis $1,149. (Tr. 49) One of her vehicles does not have a lien, and she pays $694 monthly \nfor the other vehicle. (Tr. 49-50) She has a net monthly remainder after paying debts and \nexpenses of about $500. (Tr. 52)  \nApplicant\u2019s May 10, 2019, and January 20, 2020 credit reports indicated only one \nnegative entry, and that negative entry relates to SOR \u00b6 1.a. (AE E-AE G; GE 3) \nNumerous accounts reflected a zero balance, paid, or otherwise successfully resolved. \nHer January 20, 2020 credit report shows good credit scores. (Tr. 23; AE A) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s five character witnesses have known her for up to 25 years. (Tr. 59; \nAE A-AE D) They included a supervisor, coworkers, and friends. (Tr. 59; AE A-AE D) The \ngeneral sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest, responsible, diligent, \ntrustworthy, helpful, generous, professional, and reliable. (Tr. 60-61; AE A-AE D) Their \nstatements support continuation of her security clearance. (Tr. 60-61; AE A-AE D) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cIt means such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation omitted). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant had sufficient income to pay or resolve her debts, and AG \u00b6 19(a) \nis not established. The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports reflect paid debts or debts with a zero balance or in current paid as agreed status, \nexcept for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She did not provide evidence that her financial problems \nwere largely beyond her control. Her income over the last 10 years was relatively \nconstant. She did not have any periods of unemployment in the last 20 years. \n \nApplicant provided proof that she paid or settled all three SOR-alleged debts. She \npaid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c before the SOR was issued. While she did not \nmaintain contact with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a, she did maintain her other accounts in \ncurrent status. She disputed the amount of interest that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a was \ncharging. She offered to continue paying the creditor $400 monthly, and the creditor \nrefused to accept this payment.  \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 \nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) (internal citation and footnote omitted)). Applicant showed \nsome good faith when she resolved all three of the SOR debts. I found her statement at \nher hearing to candid and credible. The delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. There are clear indications her financial \nproblems are under control. Her handling her finances does not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Financial considerations security concerns \nare mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 50 years old, and she has been an acquisitions lead and senior \nprogram analyst for a DOD contractor for five years. She has been employed by the same \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nemployer or predecessor employer since 1996. She completed three years of college. \nApplicant\u2019s five character witnesses have known her for up to 25 years. They included a \nsupervisor, coworkers, and friends. The general sense of their statements is that \nApplicant is honest, responsible, diligent, trustworthy, helpful, generous, professional, \nand reliable. Their statements supported continuation of her security clearance. She has \nheld a secret security clearance since 2008, and there is no evidence of security \nviolations. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting \nadmissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d but commenting that security concerns may \nnevertheless not be mitigated). \n \n \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, when she resolved all of her \ndebts. Her May 10, 2019, and January 20, 2020 credit reports indicated only one negative \nentry, and that negative entry relates to SOR \u00b6 1.a. She settled SOR \u00b6 1.a by paying \n$8,500. She understands that she needs to pay her debts, and the conduct required to \nretain her security clearance.        \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:  \n \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain \nher financial responsibility. Her efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d of debt re-payment. I am confident she will maintain her financial \nresponsibility. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not expressly admit or deny the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.p. In response to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.n, he stated that the debts were settled, but he did not provide any documentation of a settlement. In response to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f-1.j, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p, he stated that he would make an effort to pay the debts. He did not respond to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l. His answers to the SOR are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 66-year-old custodian employed by a federal contractor since June 1998. He applied for a security clearance in June 1998, and it apparently was granted and has been revalidated at least once since he was hired by his current employer.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 2, 2017. On \nSeptember 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 16, 2019, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on December 27, 2019. On December 30, 2019, a complete copy of the file \n\n \n2 \n \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on January 6, 2020, and timely responded. His \nresponse was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A and included in the record without \nobjection. AX A consisted of another copy of Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and did not \ninclude any additional information. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2020.  \n \nEvidentiary Issue \n \nThe FORM included a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \non September 25, 2018. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on \nthe accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; \nor object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nApplicant responded to the FORM but did not comment on the accuracy or completeness \nof the PSI summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he waived any objections to \nthe PSI summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they \nare expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the \nDirective. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-\n03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding that it was reasonable for the administrative \njudge to conclude that any objection had been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object \nafter being notified of the right to object). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. He did not expressly admit or deny the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.p. In \nresponse to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.n, he stated that the debts were settled, \nbut he did not provide any documentation of a settlement. In response to the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f-1.j, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p, he stated that he would make an effort to \npay the debts. He did not respond to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l. His answers \nto the SOR are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old custodian employed by a federal contractor since June \n1998. He applied for a security clearance in June 1998, and it apparently was granted \nand has been revalidated at least once since he was hired by his current employer. \n \n \nApplicant attended an institute for the deaf and blind from about August 1960 to \nMay 1969 and then attended a trade school for about three years. He did not receive a \ndiploma or degree from either institution. (FORM Item 4 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant married in April 1984 and divorced in March 2010. He has lived with his \nex-wife since July 2016. He has a 33-year-old daughter, who assisted him in completing \nhis SCA and handles all his financial matters. (FORM Item 3 at 18; FORM Item 4 at 3-5.) \nThe security investigator who interviewed Applicant noted that he did not understand \nseveral of the concepts discussed during the interview. The investigator also noted that \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant cannot read, write, or type and has limited ability to use sign language. Applicant \ntold the investigator that he did not know what a credit report is, because his daughter \nhandles all his financial affairs. (FORM Item 4 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in January 2009 \nand received a discharge in April 2009. The petition listed $21,094 in secured claims, \nincluding two automobiles, and $41,133 in unsecured debts, including deficiencies after \ntwo repossessions and multiple consumer debts and credit-card accounts. The \nbankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $35,486 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-\n1.p). Applicant did not provide evidence that any of the debts have been resolved. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he promised to resolve 11 of the debts, but provided no evidence of \nspecific actions to resolve them. During the interview by the security investigator in \nSeptember 2018, he was unable to provide any specific information about the delinquent \ndebts reflected in his credit reports. Most of the debts became delinquent before May \n2016, except the $70 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, which became delinquent in \nSeptember 2018.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s divorce, his limited communication \nability, and inability to manage his own financial affairs are conditions beyond his control. \nHowever, there is no evidence in the record connecting his divorce or his disabilities to \nthe Chapter 7 bankruptcy or his current debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant completed the counseling required to \nobtain a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, but his current problems are not under control. \n \nAG\u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments, \npayment agreements, or other resolution of his debts. His promises to pay the debts are \nnot a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. 07-\n13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s disabilities deserve sympathetic consideration, his inability to \nmanage his financial affairs makes him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation or \nduress. Because he requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis financial delinquencies. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

She refuted the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 13, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November \n\n \n2 \n \n \n20, 2019. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant did not submit a \ntimely response. There were no objections by Applicant, and all Items are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2001 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. She has two daughters, ages 15 and 21 years old. She has \nworked from June 2017 to the present as an administrative assistant for a nongovernment \nentity. From July 2015 to June 2017, she was unemployed due to a medical problem and \nher recovery. Before then she worked for a federal contractor. She stated in her security \nclearance application (SCA) that she resigned from that job because she filed a \ncomplained and was mistreated.  \n \n \nApplicant completed a SCA in December 2017. Section 26 inquired about \nApplicant\u2019s finances. In response to questions asking her if in the past seven years she \nhad possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed; had \ndefaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; was \nover 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously entered; or if she was currently over \n120 days delinquent on any debt, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to each of these inquires. \n(Item 3) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s narrative response in the SCA, she listed a debt owed to Car \nCompany K. She disclosed she owed $10,500 on the car loan. She stated the reason for \nthe financial issue was \u201cunemployment.\u201d She stated regarding the loan\u2019s current status: \n\u201cWorking towards a settlement agreement to get the amount reduced and paid off in full.\u201d \n(Item 3) The date the financial issue began was October 2015. She further stated: \u201cI have \nbeen unemployed since July 2015 and only recently have started working again. I am \nworking towards a settlement agreement to get the amount reduced and paid off in \nfull.\u201d(Item 3) This debt is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated February 2018, \nNovember 2018, and July 2019. (Items 5, 6, 7) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to Car Company K on a charged-off \naccount in the approximate amount of $22,354. Applicant denied this debt. She stated in \nher Answer to the SOR (Answer): \n \n \nI deny this is my account. This account was opened fraudulently in my name \nwithout my consent. I have been disputing this account as of 2015. This \nitem is currently in progress as it pertains to a new dispute and \nreinvestigation as of 7/2019. This item is listed only on my Equifax and \nExperian Credit Reports. Please see attached documents for your review \n\n \n3 \n \n \nas it pertains to Experian & Equifax reinvestigations in progress. Please see \nattached documents as it pertains to my Transunion Credit Report showing \nthat this item is not listed. (Item 2) \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in her SCA that she was indebted to the utility company and \nthe subsequent collection company in the amount of approximately $500 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) \n(Item 2). She stated:  \n \nI have been disputing this bill with [utility company] from an old bill at my \nlast address that I rented and moved out in October 2015 despite having \nthe power disconnected in my name and months to a year after I moved the \nlights were still on in my name and had never ever been disconnected. (Item \n2) \n \nShe stated the current status of the debt was as follows:  \n \n \nI have been unemployed since July 2015 and only recently have started \nworking. I am working towards a settlement agreement to get the amount \nreduced and paid off in full. (Item 2) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges Applicant is indebted to a collection company for an account \nplaced for collection by a utility company in the approximate amount of $563. Although \nshe disclosed this debt in the SCA, Applicant denied this debt in her Answer: \n \nI deny this is my account. This account was opened fraudulently in my name \nwithout my consent. This account was never listed on any of my 3 credit \nbureaus and reports. This item is not listed, reflect or showing at all on any \nof my current credit reports as of 08/20/19. Please see attached documents \nfor your review as it pertains to Experian, Equifax, and Transunion. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2018. During the \ninterview she was asked if she had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency. \nApplicant responded \u201cyes.\u201d She stated she had a debt to Car Company K (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand one owed to a utility company (SOR \u00b61.k) She acknowledged the debt to the utility \ncompany and the collection company that had assumed the debt. She said she was \nunfamiliar with the other debts that she was confronted with and are alleged in the SOR. \n(Item 4) \n \nCredit reports from February 2018, November 208, and July 2018 corroborate all \nof the SOR allegations. (Items 5, 6, 7) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer she stated:  \n \nI was a victim of the Equifax Security Break/File A Claim; OPM Security Breach; \nThe Cross vs Wells Fargo Bank, NA Breach; Wells Fargo Bank, NA TCPA Settlement; \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe Marriott Data Breach and The Souter v. Equifax Information Services, \nLLC/Settlement. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant provided documents to show she disputed the remaining debts in the \nSOR, stating that they were opened fraudulently and without her consent. Some of the \ndifferent entities responsible for data breaches provided her cash settlements, others \nremoved the accounts from their databases and from her credit reports. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant provided no credible explanation for why she disclosed in her SCA the \ndebts she incurred that are alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k and said that she was unable to \npay them due to her unemployment. She stated that she was working on settlements with \nthese creditors. In her Answer, she asserted these were fraudulent accounts opened \nwithout her consent. Her explanations are inconsistent. These accounts are unresolved. \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated from her employment in 2015 and \nwas not eligible for rehire. Applicant provided an email showing she offered her \nresignation to the employer and it was accepted. (Item 2) The Government did not provide \nevidence that Applicant was terminated from that employment and not subject for rehire.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts from at least 2015 that are not resolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant claimed that all of the debts alleged in the SOR are accounts that were \nfraudulently opened in her name without her consent. Based on the contradictory \nevidence she provided in her SCA and during her background interview, her denials of \nresponsibility for her debts are not credible, in particular those regarding the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k. Her failure to be honest about those debts, leads me to question \nher claims regarding the other SOR debts. That being said, the creditors and various \nentities responsible for data breaches have resolved her claims and disputes in her favor. \nI find she has mitigated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.jj and 1.l. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nto them.  \n \n \nApplicant clearly stated in her SCA, to which she swore to under oath, that the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k belonged to her. She confirmed this in her response to \nquestions by the government investigator. These debts are recent and ongoing. She \nprovided no evidence that she has attempted to pay them or resolve them. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct casts doubt on her reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond her control. She claimed she was working \non a settlement with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k. She failed to provide evidence \nto support she has paid or resolved these debts. It is clear they were not the result of \nfraud. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was terminated from employment in July 2015 and not \neligible for rehire. No evidence was provided by the Government regarding her alleged \ntermination or status for rehire. Applicant provided evidence that she resigned. The \ndisqualifying condition does not apply. Applicant refuted this allegation, and I find in her \nfavor under this guideline.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. She experienced financial problems when she was \nunemployed. She claimed that all of the debts alleged in the SOR were due to fraudulent \nactivity conducted without her consent. Based on her disclosures on her SCA, which were \nlater confirmed during her interview with a government investigator, at least two of the \nalleged debts were her responsibility. Although she has managed to successfully dispute \nall of the other alleged debts, her inconsistent statements regarding the two unresolved \ndebts raise sufficient concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness. She has not met \nher burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 30, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on October 31, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 26, \n2020. The hearing was convened as scheduled on July 14, 2020.  \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were \nadmitted without objection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout India. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and documents and will \nnot be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that India is the world\u2019s \nlargest democracy, works closely with the United States on many matters, shares \ncommon strategic interests, and generally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also \ncontinues to have human rights problems; it has been victimized by terrorist attacks; \nand restricted dual-use technology has been illegally exported to India. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old part-owner of a defense contracting company.

(Tr. at 22, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 2) \nApplicant is principal owner (50%) and chief executive officer of an information \ntechnology (IT) and engineering staffing company that was started in 2015. The \ncompany provides IT professionals and engineers to other companies. The IT \nprofessionals and engineers are employees of Applicant\u2019s company, but work at various \nother companies in the United States. Applicant\u2019s company has a subsidiary staffing \ncompany that provides healthcare workers to companies and healthcare facilities. His \ncompany also has a wholly owned subsidiary in India that works at placing the \ncompany\u2019s IT professionals and engineers in the United States at companies in the \nUnited States. The Indian subsidiary is purely support for the U.S. business. It does not \nplace any individuals in Indian businesses, and it does not generate any income in \nIndia.

The company has about 320 employees in \nIndia. Applicant estimated the value of his share of the company at $7 to $10 million. \nThe company does not have any defense contracts, and there is no plan to pursue any \nin the future. (Tr. at 23-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant owns 50 percent of the defense contracting company. That company is \nmuch smaller than his staffing company. It is primarily for Applicant and his partners to \nwork as contractors. He estimates the value of his share of that company at $20,000. \n(Tr. at 31-33; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant frequently talks to his parents and sister, and he regularly travels to \nIndia to visit his family and to oversee his staffing company. He periodically gave money \nto his parents, and he maintains bank accounts in India, including at least one joint \naccount with his father. The accounts were used to facilitate the transfer of funds to his \nparents and for Applicant to use when he is in India. About five to seven years ago, \nApplicant gave his father about $50,000 to help renovate his house and to replace an \nold car. Applicant has less than $5,000 in his Indian accounts at present. He estimates \nhis total net worth at about $15 million. (Tr. at 33-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 2; AE B, C)  \n \n \nApplicant expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, which he \nconsiders his home. He stated, \u201c[t]his is my present, this is my future, this is where my \nkids [were] born.\u201d He credibly testified that his family and assets in India could not be \nused to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. (Tr. at 43-44) \n \n \nApplicant is active in his community. He submitted letters attesting to his strong \nmoral character, responsibility, dependability, work ethic, dedication, generosity, and \nintegrity. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \n(b) \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are citizens and residents of India. He has several \nthousand dollars in bank accounts in India. His staffing company has a wholly owned \nsubsidiary in India that works at placing the company\u2019s IT professionals and engineers \nin the United States at companies in the United States. India is the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracy, works closely with the United States on many matters, shares common \nstrategic interests, and generally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also continues \nto have human rights problems; it has been victimized by terrorist attacks; and restricted \ndual-use technology has been illegally exported to India. Applicant\u2019s foreign family and \nfinancial interests create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and \n7(e) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to India. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. His wife and children are U.S. citizens and \nresidents, but his parents and sister are citizens and residents of India. Applicant is a \nsuccessful businessman with a net worth of about $15 million. His staffing company\u2019s \nwholly owned subsidiary in India is purely to support his U.S. business, not unlike when \ncompanies maintain call centers overseas to support their U.S. businesses. \nApplicant and his wife gave up their Indian citizenships when they became U.S. \ncitizens. He expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, which he \nconsiders his home. He credibly testified that his family and financial interests in India \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to India are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof India. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. AG \n\u00b6 8(f) is partially applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant, a federal contractor employee, requested an upgrade of his clearance \nto work for a federal agency (Agency) in 2016. Based on information he disclosed \nduring an interview with an Agency investigator, his clearance upgrade was denied in \nJune 2016. He submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nAugust 25, 2017, requesting the continuation of his DOD secret clearance. He was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in October 2017, and answered a set of \ninterrogatories from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) in July 2019.  \n \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on \nAugust 15, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guidelines D (sexual behavior) and \nE (personal conduct). Applicant answered the SOR on September 20, 2019, and \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nrequested a decision based on the record. Department counsel requested a hearing \nbefore a DOHA administrative judge.  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on October 28, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on February 28, 2020, setting the hearing for March 5, 2020. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered nine exhibits (GE 1 through 9). GE 1 - 7 were admitted into the \nrecord without any objections. Applicant\u2019s objections to GE 8 and 9 (that the documents \nwere irrelevant and immaterial) were overruled, and I admitted the documents. \nHowever, after evaluating the documents in light of the record evidence, I considered \nthe documents to have little probative value.  \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted no additional evidence. I \nmarked the Government\u2019s discovery letter, dated October 10, 2019, as Hearing Exhibit \n1. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 13, 2020. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nOn February 28, 2019, Applicant waived his right to 15-day advance notice of his \nhearing. (HE 2) At his hearing, he stated that he had sufficient time to prepare for his \nhearing, was ready to proceed, and affirmatively waived his 15-day advance notice of \nhis hearing. (Tr. 14-15) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the two SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a) and submitted \nmitigating comments. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He enlisted in the \nArmy in 1976, served honorably on active duty for three years, and was discharged as a \nsergeant (E-5) in 1979. He held a secret clearance while in the service. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1986, and completed the equivalent of a master\u2019s degree in 1991. \nHe married his wife in 1986. They have four children, ages 29, 28, 22, and 20.   \n \nApplicant has been working for different federal contractors since 1986. He has \nheld a secret-level clearance during most of his employment with federal contractors. In \n2014, he was hired by his current employer and security sponsor, a large federal \ncontractor. In 2016, Applicant requested an upgrade of his clearance eligibility to work \nfor a federal Agency. Based on information he disclosed during a polygraph-assisted \ninterview (GE 4), the Agency denied his clearance upgrade in June 2016. (GE 3) He \nunsuccessfully appealed the denial twice. (GE 5, 6, and 7) Applicant\u2019s DOD secret \nclearance was not impacted by the Agency\u2019s denial of his clearance upgrade, and he \ncontinued working for his federal contractor employer.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn his answers to Section 25 (Investigations and Clearance Record) of this 2017 \nSCA, Applicant disclosed that the Agency denied his clearance upgrade in 2016. The \nsubsequent background investigation addressed and revealed the pending security \nconcerns. Under Guideline D, the SOR alleged that from 2015 to 2016, Applicant \nsolicited prostitutes on multiple occasions while possessing a clearance, and that his \nwife, family, and employer are unaware of his behavior. Under Guideline E, the SOR \ncross-alleged the same questionable behavior. \n \nDuring his 2016 interview with an Agency investigator, Applicant was asked \nwhether he had any clandestine contact with any foreign nationals. He told the \ninterviewer that in the fall of 2015, and six months prior to the interview (December \n2015-January 2016), he visited massage parlors where he paid Asian women $40 for a \nmassage and an additional $80 to manually stimulate his penis to ejaculation. He also \ndisclosed that in the summer of 2015 and in March 2016, he rented hotel rooms and \nhad on each occasion an Asian masseuse meet him there. He found the masseuses by \nsearching web sites in the Internet. He paid the masseuses $130 each for a massage \nthat include manual stimulation of his penis to ejaculation. \n \nApplicant stated that he had other massages where no masturbation was \nincluded before, and some in between, the four massages described above that \nincluded stimulation of his penis. He has not been to any massage parlors or had any \nmassages after his June 2016 interview with an Agency investigator. The Agency \ndenied Applicant\u2019s clearance upgrade because of security concerns under Guidelines J \nand E, because he engaged in prostitution, was not candid during the interview, and his \nactions demonstrated lack of judgment, trustworthiness, honesty, and an inability to \nabide by laws. (GE 3) \n \nIn his two appeals to the Agency\u2019s denial decision, Applicant attempted to \u201cclarify \nhis testimony and correct discrepancies\u201d by claiming that: 1) none of his encounters with \nthe masseuses were set up with the intent to participate in illegal or morally \nobjectionable activity; 2) he did not rent the hotel rooms, that was the location from \nwhere the masseuses were working; 3) the fees he paid were for massages, not for sex; \nand 4) he did not believe he was engaging in prostitution because there was no \nintercourse involved. Applicant also argued that his questionable behavior was a \npersonal choice and a discrete interaction between two consenting adults and not \nprostitution. He strongly expressed his regret for his misconduct, and promised never to \nengage in similar behavior. \n \nIn his second appeal, Applicant stated: \u201c. . . in my mind I did not think of what I \ndid as an act of prostitution since there was no intercourse. It was a regrettable event \nthat I only realized was an act of prostitution when I received the initial letter informing \nme of the denial of the clearance.\u201d Applicant highlighted his professional positions of \nresponsibility, and his believe that he has been a key contributor to many of the \nsensitive and important programs he has worked.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant considers himself to be extremely reliable and dependable as shown \nby his work attendance, his promotions, and the positions he has held. He stated that \nhe holds high ethical and quality standards in his work. Applicant believes that, on \nbalance, when his professional accomplishments and contributions to the United States \nare considered against his questionable behavior, his good behavior and \naccomplishments should outweigh the security concerns. Applicant requested an \nopportunity to demonstrate that he has learned from his mistakes, and that he will never \nengage in similar criminal behavior again.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated that what he did was unacceptable, and wrong \nfrom a moral point of view, but claimed that he did not solicit prostitution. (Tr. 17-18) He \ndisputed the accuracy of the Agency\u2019s report of his June 2016 polygraph interview. In \nthe report, the interviewer stated that Applicant told him that he paid $40 per massage \nand tipped $80 for the manual stimulation of his penis, and that Applicant had rented \ntwo motel rooms on different occasions to schedule his massages. In his October 2017 \ninterview with a DOD investigator and at his hearing, Applicant claimed that he paid $80 \nper massage and tipped $40 on each of the four occasions. He claimed that the \nmasseuse rented the hotel room, not him.  \n \nApplicant repeatedly claimed that he never asked any of the four masseuses for \nthe manual stimulation of his penis. He averred that he did not go to the massage \nparlors or schedule the massages with the intent or purpose of being sexually \nstimulated. He claimed he was surprised every time they started their \u201cflirty\u201d behavior \nand manually stimulated him, but he allowed himself to become \u201ca victim of their flirty \nbehavior\u201d and did not stop the masseuse. (Tr. 36) He further claimed that his massages\u2019 \nfees did not include compensation for the stimulation of his penis. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated that in hindsight, it had been obviously a bad \nchoice - poor judgment on his part to allow himself to be stimulated. (Tr. 49) He averred \nthat during the last massage in March 2016, he specifically remembered feeling \nuncomfortable about it, because the masseuse asked him whether he was married. (Tr. \n34-35) He acknowledged his lack of judgment and expressed guilt and remorse for his \nbehavior. Applicant testified that at that point he decided never to engage again in the \nsame behavior. He promised himself never to go back to any massage parlor. \n \nApplicant has not told his wife, or any other person at home or at work, about his \nquestionable behavior with the masseuses. He explained that he is embarrassed to \nadmit that he was that weak. He stated:  \n \n\u201cI see no value in, at this point, all it would do is hurt her. That being said, \nif someone were to try to blackmail me and say, I'm going to tell your wife, \nit would not put me in a vulnerable position, because, in that case, I would \ngo to my security officer at work, inform them of what was going on, and I \nwould work with them to put that to an end.\u201d (Tr. 76-78) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant presented no character testimony. He also presented no evidence that \nhe has received sexual behavior counseling or treatment.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \nOn at least four occasions from 2015 to 2016, Applicant solicited acts of \nprostitution while possessing a security clearance. He arranged and paid for masseuses \nto manually stimulate his penis to ejaculation. He has not disclosed his sexual behavior \nto anyone, including his wife, family, and employer.  \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature; whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s soliciting and engaging in a sexual acts in exchange for money is \nillegal in both states where his behavior took place. The four known incidents constitute \na pattern of compulsive, high-risk sexual behavior that caused him to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. I find his sexual behavior reflects a lack of discretion \nand poor judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) through (d) are established by the evidence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the above mitigating \nconditions fully apply, and they do not mitigate the sexual behavior security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 14(a) is not raised by the facts of this case. I considered AG \u00b6 14(b) from the \nperspective that the sexual behavior occurred in 2015-2016 (about four years ago), and \nthere is no evidence of any additional sexual behavior of concern. As such, the offenses \ncould be considered remote. Notwithstanding, I find that these offenses did not occur \nunder unusual circumstances. Applicant solicited prostitution and engaged in sexual \nbehavior with women for money four times during a period of two years.  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his criminal sexual behavior only after a polygraph-assisted \ninterview in 2016. Since then, he has consistently attempted to minimize his criminal \nsexual behavior at every stage of the security clearance process. He has disputed the \nstatements he provided to the Agency investigator. He has portrayed himself as the \nnaive victim of flirty behavior from four different masseuses. According to him, four \ndifferent masseuses voluntarily, and without his encouragement or expectation of \nremuneration, proceeded to stimulate his penis to ejaculation. I carefully considered \nApplicant\u2019s assertions and I find his contentions not persuasive or credible.  \n \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s alleged surprise after he was stimulated by the first \nmasseuse, he scheduled three additional massages and never stopped any of the flirty \nmasseuses from sexually stimulating him. Applicant contended that he did not know his \nsexual stimulations constituted a sexual act, that he was engaging in prostitution, and \nthat he did not pay for his sexual stimulations. Considering the record as a whole, his \ncontentions are not credible  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s efforts to minimize his sexual behavior, his lack of candor, \nand his implausible and unpersuasive excuses, I cannot find that his offenses are \nunlikely to recur. Moreover, I find that his overall behavior continues to cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to inform his wife, family, friends, facility security officer, and his \nemployer of his criminal behavior. It is understandable that he does not want to hurt his \nwife or damage his marriage by disclosing his questionable behavior. Notwithstanding, \nfor those same reasons, Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior continues to be a basis for \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is not applicable because the sexual behavior was not strictly private \nor discrete. He attended massage parlors wherein one woman scheduled his massage, \nanother collected his money, and the third gave him the massage. Under these \ncircumstances, I do not find his sexual behavior strictly private or discreet. Applicant \npresented no evidence of sexual behavior counseling or treatment. AG \u00b6 14(e) is not \napplicable. He failed to mitigate the sexual behavior security concerns.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the same sexual behavior alleged \nunder Guideline D. For the sake of brevity, the findings of fact, analysis, and \nconclusions discussed under Guideline D are hereby incorporated in my Guideline E \nanalysis. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during a national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process  . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant solicited prostitutes while possessing a security clearance between \n2015 and 2016. He arranged and paid for masseuses to manually stimulate his penis to \nejaculation. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \n\u00b6 16: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \n \n \nThe record established the above disqualifying condition, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the \nfollowing mitigating condition set forth by AG \u00b6 17 as partially raised by the evidence: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAfter analyzing the above mitigating condition in light of the record evidence as a \nwhole, I find that it is not applicable to this case and it does not mitigate the personal \nconduct concerns. Considering Applicant\u2019s age, education, military service, and \nprofessional experience, I cannot find his behavior is a minor offense. Moreover, his \nlack of candor and trustworthiness, and his efforts to minimize his sexual behavior \ndiminish the value and credibility of any mitigating evidence he presented. \n \n \nSimilarly, I consider Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior recent and frequent \n(although there is no evidence of similar behavior after 2016). His continued efforts \nduring the recent security clearance hearing to minimize his past sexual behavior bring \nto the forefront the Guideline E security concerns \u2013 that Applicant continues to be \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. Applicant\u2019s questionable \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant has not participated in sexual behavior related counseling. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \napplicable. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that the Guideline E allegations \ncontinue to raise concerns under AG \u00b6 16(e), which is not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D \nand E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 61, honorably served in the U.S. military. He has been employed with \nfederal contractors since 1986. He has held a clearance, at least between 1986 and \n2019, without any security incidents of concern, except for the SOR allegations.  \n \nAlthough Applicant presented no character testimony, his position with a large \nfederal contractor attests to his professionalism, skills, knowledge, and that he is \nconsidered a productive member of the company. Nevertheless, it is well settled that \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nonce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against granting a security clearance. Unmitigated security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that granting a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Schachter, Esq.  \n \n05/12/2020 \n___________ \n \nDecision  \n___________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant mitigated Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse) security \nconcerns because his most recent marijuana use was in 2014, and his marijuana use is \nnot recent; however, he did not mitigate Guideline E (personal conduct) security concerns \nrelating to his false statements in 2018 about his history of marijuana use. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 13, 2012, and April 23, 2018, Applicant completed and signed \nQuestionnaires for National Security Positions or security clearance applications (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1; GE 2) On August 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines H and E. (HE \n2) On September 25, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On October 30, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.    \n \nOn November 26, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 20, 2019, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for January 16, 2020. (HE 1C) On January 13, 2020, the hearing was \ncancelled, and on January 13, 2020, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the hearing \nfor February 13, 2020. (HE 1A; HE 1B) The hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 3 exhibits; Applicant offered 11 \ndocuments including the exhibits previously provided with the SOR as well as 3 additional \nexhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 11-12, \n20-24, 35-40; GE 1-3; AE A-K) On February 15, 2020, Applicant provided an additional \nexhibit; there was no objection; and the document was admitted into the record. (AE L) \nOn February 18, 2020, the record closed. (Tr. 42-43) On February 24, 2020, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing. \n \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR and ADP decisions and \nthe Directive are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nApplicant moved to dismiss SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b because he had previously \nreceived a favorable adjudication concerning his marijuana use in 2014, and he urged \napplication of the concept of double jeopardy. (Tr. 12-14) He believed it was \u201cunfair, \ninefficient, unnecessary, and ought not to be allowed\u201d for the government to raise his \nmarijuana involvement because of the absence of evidence of a pattern of marijuana \ninvolvement, and there was no evidence of marijuana involvement after 2014. (Tr. 14-15) \nDepartment Counsel opposed the motion. (Tr. 16-17)  \n \nThe Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nprohibits prosecution twice for substantially the same crime by the same sovereign. The \nrelevant part of the Fifth Amendment states, \u201cNo person shall . . . be subject for the same \noffense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, and he did not contend there was a previous security-related finding that his \nmarijuana use in 2014 was unsubstantiated. (Tr. 14) A security clearance proceeding or \ndetermination is not a criminal prosecution, and the Fifth Amendment does not limit \nreconsideration of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in administrative proceedings. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03047 at 4 (App. Bd. May 29, 2018), the Appeal Board said: \n \nIt is well established, however, that there is no right to a security clearance, \nand a past decision to grant or continue a security clearance does not give \nrise to any right or vested interest in a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nCase No. 03-24144 at 6 (Dec. 6, 2005). Furthermore, a favorable security \nclearance decision does not preclude the Federal Government from \nreassessing a person\u2019s security eligibility in light of current circumstances. Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in 2014 provides the basis for assessment of the alleged \nfalsification under Guideline E. The allegations under Guideline H are dated or stale but \nstill relevant, and Applicant\u2019s motion was denied. (Tr. 17) My denial of the motion did not \nrestrict Applicant\u2019s right to present mitigation evidence relating to his history of marijuana \nuse. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n(HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and mitigating \ninformation. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old senior technical consultant in information technology or \nsenior network administrator. (Tr. 25, 27; HE 3 at 1; GE 1; AE A) In 2009, he received a \nhigh school diploma. (GE 1) In 2016, he received an associate\u2019s degree. (Tr. 26; GE 1) \nHe needs one credit to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 26-27) He is scheduled to receive \na bachelor\u2019s degree in early 2020 in network and cyber security. (Tr. 27; AE A; AE D) He \ncompleted numerous information technology certification courses and endeavored to \nenhance his technical expertise and value to his employers. (HE 3; AE B; AE C) He \nserved in the Army National Guard from 2012 through 2018. (HE 3 at 2) When he was \nhonorably discharged, he was a specialist (E-4). (AE E) He is not married, and he does \nnot have any children. (Tr. 26; GE 1) He has been dating his fianc\u00e9e for about two years. \n(Tr. 26) She and her family are very supportive of Applicant. (Tr. 47) His current \nemployment is in jeopardy if his security clearance is not reinstated or continued. (Tr. 28) \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency \nin the spring and early summer of 2014. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant tested positive for \nthe presence of the marijuana metabolite in his urine in approximately June 2014. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. (HE 3) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 13, 2012 SCA, he disclosed marijuana use in 2006. (Tr. \n49) He said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 49) \n \nOn October 25, 2014, Applicant submitted a request for a suspended general \ndischarge from the Army National Guard. (GE 3) He said he used marijuana to help him \ncope with diagnosed depression. (GE 3) He used marijuana in lieu of prescription drugs \nhe was authorized to take. (GE 3) He did not reveal how many times he used marijuana \nor how long he used marijuana before it was detected through a urinalysis test. He \nsuccessfully completed the Army National Guard probation period. (Tr. 33-34) In June \n2017, Applicant responded to an SOR based on a positive urinalysis test showing use of \nmarijuana in July 2014. (Tr. 35; AE J; AE K; AE L) On June 30, 2017, his security manager \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nadvised Applicant \u201cyour Secret clearance was adjudicated on 28 June 17[, and] the SOR \nwas sent out in error.\u201d (Tr. 40; AE L) \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said he used marijuana from \nJune 1, 2014, to August 10, 2014, on a weekly basis. (GE 3 at 4) A close friend of \nApplicant\u2019s said Applicant told him that he used marijuana on a weekly basis for about \nfive months until he was caught on the urinalysis test in 2014. (Tr. 76) In 2014, Applicant\u2019s \nfriend advised Applicant to stop using marijuana; however, Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana. (Tr. 77) Applicant said he stopped using marijuana because of \u201cfear of losing \nmy military career and all civilian side consequences.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) He received substance \nabuse counseling in June 2016. (GE 3 at 8) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he used marijuana once in 2007 when he was about \n16 years old, and then resumed his marijuana use in 2014. (Tr. 29) He used marijuana \non a weekly basis in 2014, and he purchased the marijuana from a friend he knew in \ncollege. (Tr. 31) In 2014, he used marijuana because of stress in his relationship with his \nparents. (Tr. 30) His mother was ill. (Tr. 30) His father was an alcoholic, and his father \nwas \u201ccombative and aggressive.\u201d (Tr. 30; HE 3 at 2-3) He does not associate with the \nperson who provided marijuana to him or anyone else involved in marijuana distribution. \n(Tr. 32, 48)   \n \nApplicant suffered from depression in 2014. He sought and received treatment for \nhis depression, and he moved out of his home. (HE 3 at 2) His mother remarried, and \nApplicant is close to his mother. (Tr. 46; HE 3 at 2)    \n \nApplicant changed after the positive urinalysis test in 2014 showing marijuana use, \nand he stopped using marijuana. (Tr. 32) He exercises and has healthy eating habits. (HE \n3 at 4) He stays away from drug users, and he strives to spend time with his family. (HE \n3 at 4) He did not test positive for use of any illegal drugs after 2014. (HE 3 at 5) He \nexpressed his remorse for his illegal drug use. (HE 3 at 5)  \n \nApplicant promised not to use illegal drugs in the future. (HE 3 at 5) He provided \n\u201ca signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility.\u201d (HE 3 at 5 (citing AE H); see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3))    \n \nPossession of small amounts of marijuana has been increasingly decriminalized \nin various states and the District of Columbia. (AE I) No evidence was presented of repeal \nof the federal statute prohibiting possession of marijuana or revocation of the policy \nprohibition against use of marijuana by security clearance holders.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to a question in Section 23 of \nhis April 23, 2018 SCA about whether he used any controlled substance in the previous \nseven years. (Tr. 43-44) At the time he completed his April 23, 2018 SCA, he was serving \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nin the Army National Guard. As indicated in the previous section, Applicant used \nmarijuana for several months in 2014 while serving in the Army National Guard.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said the reason he answered, \u201cNo,\u201d about his marijuana \nuse in the previous seven years was because he believed the question sought information \nnot previously disclosed. (Tr. 44) He did not intend to conceal his marijuana use. (Tr. 44-\n45) The Army National Guard already had the information about his positive urinalysis \ntest for marijuana, and DOD CAF had the information as indicated in his SOR response. \n(Tr. 45) In his SCA, he indicated his security worthiness had previously been investigated. \n(Tr. 45) \n \nApplicant responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to two additional questions in Section 23 of his April \n23, 2018 SCA that asked about whether he was ordered, asked, or advised to seek \ncounseling or treatment as a result of his use of illegal drugs and whether he ever \nvoluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of his use of a controlled substance. \n(Tr. 54; GE 1) Applicant was supposed to attend an Army Alcohol Substance Abuse \nProgram (ASAP); however, he did not actually attend ASAP. (Tr. 62; OPM ROI at 21) In \nJune 2016, he attended 16 hours in a substance abuse education seminar provided by a \ncivilian entity. (GE 3) He successfully completed the course. (GE 3) Applicant said he \nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d because he thought the SCA was seeking new information about drug \nabuse counseling. (Tr. 54)   \n \nApplicant responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to a question in Section 21 of his April 23, 2018 SCA \nthat asked about whether he had \u201cEVER been diagnosed by a physician or other health \nprofessional . . . with [a] psychotic disorder, . . . [or] bipolar mood disorder . . . ?\u201d (GE 1) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said he was met with a psychiatrist in \n2015 and 2017, and he received Lexapro, Lamictal and Zoloft. (GE 3 at 4, 7) Lexapro or \n\u201cEscitalopram is used to treat depression and anxiety.\u201d (www.webmd.com) \u201cLamictal is \nalso used to delay mood episodes in adults with bipolar disorder (manic depression).\u201d \nwww.drugs.com. \u201cZoloft (sertraline) is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive \ndisorder and panic and anxiety disorders.\u201d (Id.) In response to a DOHA interrogatory, he \nwrote that the reason the medication was prescribed was \u201cbipolar depression\u201d and he \nprovided the name of the physician that prescribed the prescription drugs. (GE 3 at 4) \nApplicant admitted he received treatment for depression while he was in the Army \nNational Guard. (Tr. 60) He did not disclose his treatment for depression on his SCA \nbecause he \u201cviewed it as a stigma.\u201d He \u201cdidn\u2019t want people to know he had it.\u201d (Tr. 61) He \ndid reveal the treatment to his team leader, but he was worried about the \u201cstigma\u201d and \nbeing \u201cportrayed as weak.\u201d (Tr. 65) \n \nApplicant responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to a question in Section 13A of his April 23, 2018 SCA \nthat asked Applicant whether in the previous seven years he \u201creceived a written warning, \nbeen officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, \nsuch as a violation of security policy.\u201d (Tr. 50-51; GE 1) He did not disclose any adverse \nactions he received from the Army National Guard for using marijuana. Applicant received \na written warning and reprimand for using marijuana in the Army National Guard after his \n2014 positive urinalysis test. (Tr. 51-52) Applicant said he should have indicated, \u201cYes,\u201d \nin response to the question. (Tr. 52) He explained that he answered, \u201cNo,\u201d because he \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \ndid not receive any adverse action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and he was \nnot discharged from the Army National Guard for marijuana use. (Tr. 52)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant stated during an August 2, 2018 Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) that he has not used any \ndrugs in the previous seven years. (Tr. 55) \n \nThe August 2, 2018 OPM PSI is a summary non-verbatim description of what \nApplicant told an OPM investigator. His OPM PSI states that Applicant \u201cconfirmed that he \nhas not used any drugs in the last seven years.\u201d (OPM Report of Investigation (ROI) at \n11) Applicant \u201cwas given every opportunity to provide clarification or additional information \nin regards to any disciplinary actions taken against him during his time in the military, but \n[he] did not provide anything and had to be confronted.\u201d (OPM ROI at 12) Applicant was \nthen confronted with documentation from the Army National Guard showing he was given \na suspended discharge in 2014 because of his use of marijuana discovered through the \npositive urinalysis discussed previously. (Id.) He was on probation for 12 months. (Id. at \n13) Applicant said he did not remember how many times he used marijuana. (Id.) \nApplicant said he used marijuana to help him cope with his depression. (Id. at 12-13) The \nArmy suggested that Applicant receive treatment for his depression and drug use. (Id. at \n13)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2, 2018 OPM PSI states that Applicant did not provide \ninformation about his marijuana use because \u201cthe issue was never filed under UCMJ and \nthere were no punishments that affect [Applicant\u2019s] job.\u201d (OPM ROI at 13) Applicant\u2019s \nOctober 30, 2018 OPM PSI states that Applicant did not provide information about his \nmarijuana use in 2014 for the following reason: \n \n[T]his was only an issue within his unit. It was kept between his team leader, \nhimself, and the captain who wrote the memorandum [about his suspended \ndischarge]. This was not common knowledge within the unit. Because of \nthat and the fact that it did not fall under the UCMJ, [Applicant] did not \nbelieve that the information has to be listed. (Tr. 62-63; OPM ROI at 17)  \n \nIn response to a request for an explanation for why he gave a different answer to \nthe OPM investigator about his rational for not disclosing his history of marijuana use in \n2014 than at his hearing, Applicant said he suspected he did not disclose his marijuana \nuse on his SCA due to being \u201cashamed.\u201d (Tr. 63) He also thought, \u201chey, it\u2019s already been \nnoted. It\u2019s already in the records. You can let it slide essentially.\u201d (Tr. 64) He \nacknowledged that he \u201clied,\u201d and there was a strong probability that the government would \ndiscover the truth. (Tr. 66)  \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant said he did not intentionally lie to security officials \nbecause he believed security officials would examine his record and discover his previous \npositive urinalysis test showing his marijuana use. (HE 3 at 6) He assumed the previous \nsecurity-related adjudication of his marijuana use in 2017 would be part of the record. (HE \n3 at 6) He said, \u201c[h]e had no new information to report-no recent use-and as such, did not \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nreport anything. He regrets now that he did not re-report his previously reported 2014 \nissues, and he will not make this mistake again.\u201d (Tr. 55; HE 3 at 7) \n  \nApplicant promised to be honest in future security matters. (Tr. 65-66) He faced \nadversity and acknowledged his mistakes. (Tr. 67, 78-79) He promised to strive to \nimprove. (Tr. 67) He intends to establish his integrity and trustworthiness. (Tr. 67)   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nNine supervisors, coworkers, colleagues, or friends or both as well as his fianc\u00e9e \nprovided character statements supporting reinstatement or continuation of Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified information. (Tr. 70-91; AE B; AE F) The general sense of their \nstatements is that Applicant is exceptionally diligent, knowledgeable, intelligent, \nmeticulous, professional, generous, honest, reliable, and trustworthy. His hard work and \nprofessionalism made substantial contributions to mission accomplishment. He learns \nfrom his mistakes and does not repeat them. None of his character statements described \nany use of illegal drugs after 2014. He completed several military courses, and he \nachieved good to outstanding course evaluations. (AE E) In one course, he was selected \nas the distinguished honor graduate. (AE E) There is no evidence of adverse employment \nactions, security violations, improper disclosure of classified information, or that Applicant \notherwise compromised national security. (Tr. 28)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cIt means such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation omitted). \u201cThe \nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under \nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence \nof nexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(b) \ntesting positive for an illegal drug\u201d; and \u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance.\u201d \nApplicant admitted marijuana possession and use in 2014. His marijuana use was \ndetected through an Army National Guard administered urinalysis test in 2014.   \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. \nSee Drug Enforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ \n21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing \nplacement of marijuana on Schedule I). AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(c) are established. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nApplicant completed a 16-hour substance abuse-related class. He does not \nassociate with marijuana users. He promised not to use illegal drugs in the future. He \nprovided \u201ca signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility.\u201d See AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). Applicant most recent possession and \nuse of marijuana occurred more than five years ago when he was self-medicating because \nof depression or bipolar depression or both and due to stress because of his relationship \nwith his father. He received treatment for his mental-health issues. He has a close \nsupportive relationship with his fianc\u00e9e. His marijuana possession and use happened so \nlong ago or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. See AG \u00b6 \n26(a). Guideline H security concerns are mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists \u201cconditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying includ[ing]\u201d: \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant did not disclose his marijuana use in 2014 on his April 23, 2018 SCA, \nand he did not disclose it until confronted during his August 2, 2018 OPM PSI. He was in \nthe Army National Guard when he used marijuana and when he made these two \nstatements. Applicant said at his hearing and in his SOR response that he did not intend \nto mislead or lie about his history of marijuana use. He asserted that the government was \nalready well aware of his marijuana use in 2014 because: (1) he tested positive for use \nof marijuana during an Army National Guard urinalysis test; (2) he was processed for \ndischarge by the Army National Guard, and he received a suspended discharge; and (3) \nhe was issued an SOR by DOD based on his marijuana use in 2014. The Appeal Board \nhas cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:  \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2, 2018 OPM PSI states that Applicant did not provide \ninformation about his marijuana use because \u201cthe issue was never filed under UCMJ and \nthere were no punishments that affect the Subject\u2019s job.\u201d (Id.) Applicant\u2019s October 30, \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n2018 OPM PSI states that Applicant did not provide information about his marijuana use \nin 2014 for the following reason: \n \n[T]his was only an issue within his unit. It was kept between his team leader, \nhimself, and the captain who wrote the memorandum [about his suspended \ndischarge]. This was not common knowledge within the unit. Because of \nthat and the fact that it did not fall under the UCMJ, [Applicant] did not \nbelieve that the information ha[d] to be listed. (OPM ROI at 17)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanations during his August 2, 2018 and October 30, 2018 OPM \nPSIs were not consistent with his explanation at his hearing and SOR response, that is, \nhe did not need to disclose his history of illegal drug use because it was already well \nknown by officials. He said that he lied because he was probably ashamed. Applicant\u2019s \nclaims in his SOR response and at his hearing that he did not intend to mislead security \nofficials are not credible.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s intentional lies in 2018 about his marijuana possession and use in 2014 \nshow questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules. Such conduct adversely affects his professional and community \nstanding. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e) are established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he lied on his April 23, 2018 SCA when he \nfailed to disclose: (1) suggestions from Army National Guard members that he receive \nsome drug-related counseling; (2) receipt of drug-related counseling; (3) being counseled \nor reprimanded by his unit leadership about not using marijuana or being placed in a \nconditional discharge status in the Army National Guard or both because of the positive \nurinalysis test for marijuana; and (4) mental-health treatment for his depression or bipolar \ndepression or both. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be \nconsidered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s false statements. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor about his marijuana use on his April 23, 2018 SCA and before \nbeing confronted with evidence during his August 2, 2018 OPM PSI show a lack of \nrehabilitation. Future inappropriate behavior is likely to occur. His behavior continues to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old senior technical consultant in information technology or \nsenior network administrator. In 2016, he received an associate\u2019s degree, and he was \nscheduled to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in the fall of 2019 in network and cyber security. \nHe completed numerous information technology certification courses and endeavored to \nenhance his technical expertise and value to his employers. He served in the Army \nNational Guard from 2012 through 2018. When he was honorably discharged, he was a \nspecialist. He is not married, and he does not have any children.   \n \nNine supervisors, coworkers, colleagues, or friends or both as well as his fianc\u00e9e \nprovided character statements supporting reinstatement or continuation of Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified information. The general sense of their statements is that Applicant \nis exceptionally diligent, knowledgeable, intelligent, meticulous, professional, generous, \nhonest, and trustworthy. His hard work and professionalism resulted in substantial \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. None of his character statements described \nany use of illegal drugs after 2014. He completed several military courses, and he \nachieved good to outstanding course evaluations. There is no evidence of security \nviolations, improper disclosure of classified information, or that Applicant otherwise \ncompromised national security. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, \n2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and commenting that security \nconcerns may nevertheless not be mitigated).  \n \nThe evidence against reinstatement of his access to classified information is \npersuasive. Applicant failed to fully and frankly disclose his marijuana use in 2014 in his \nApril 23, 2018 SCA and his August 2, 2018 OPM PSI before being confronted by the \nevidence of marijuana use. He maintained in his SOR response and at his hearing that \nhe did not disclose this negative information on his April 23, 2018 SCA and his August 2, \n2018 OPM PSI before being confronted because the government was already aware of \nhis marijuana involvement. His statement during his OPM PSI that he did not disclose the \ninformation because knowledge of his marijuana use was limited to a small number of \nArmy National Guard personnel is more credible and somewhat inconsistent with his \nmore recent explanations of why he failed to disclose his 2014 marijuana possession and \nuse in 2018.  \n  \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s state of mind when he completed his April 23, 2018 SCA is also shown \nby his failure to disclose on that SCA: (1) suggestions from Army National Guard \nmembers that he receive some drug-related counseling; (2) receipt of drug-related \ncounseling; (3) being counseled or reprimanded by his unit leadership about not using \nmarijuana or being placed in a conditional discharge status in the Army National Guard \nor both because of the positive urinalysis test for marijuana; and (4) mental-health \ntreatment for his depression or bipolar depression or both. If Applicant had disclosed his \nmarijuana-related counseling and treatment or adverse command action for marijuana \nuse, it would have led to questions about his marijuana use in 2014.  \n \nThe protection of national security relies on applicants to self-report conduct that \njeopardizes security, even when that disclosure might damage the applicant\u2019s career. AG \n\u00b6 15 emphasizes the importance to security of Applicants providing accurate security-\nrelated information. Applicant cannot be trusted to disclose potentially derogatory \nsecurity-related information about himself. He did not establish his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns; however, he failed to mitigate \npersonal conduct security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eisen, Esquire \n06/16/2020 \n______________\nDecision \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case [transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-5, \nhearing exhibits (HE) I-II, and Applicant exhibits (AE) A-D], I deny Applicant=s clearance. \nOn 26 June 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, \nand Guideline E, Personal Conduct.1 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a \nhearing before the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the \ncase to me 1 October 2019, and I convened a hearing 19 November 2019. DOHA \nreceived the transcript 3 December 2019, and the record closed.  \n1DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, but denied falsifying his 2017 \nclearance application, asserting that he did not think that delinquent loans were Aroutine \naccounts.@ He is a 61-year-old database administrator employed by a U.S. defense \ncontractor since September 2015. He has been continuously employed in similar \npositions since 2007. He seeks to retain the clearance he has held since August 2007. \n \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the U.S. in 1985 to attend \ngraduate school on a scholarship. In 1988, he married a woman from his native country, \nand became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1991. He and his wife have four U.S.-born \nchildren together, born in 1989, 1993, 1997, and 1999. \n \nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits (GE) 2-5 establish, and Applicant admits, \ntwo delinquent education loans totaling over $238,000. The loan balances represent loan \ndistributions made to Applicant between about 1989 and 1995 while he pursued his \ndoctoral degree, which was awarded in 1995 (Tr. 32). \n \nApplicant reports, without corroboration, that he initially made payment on his \neducation loans when repayment began after the post-graduation grace period ended. As \nhis family size grew, and the children grew, the pressure on his finances grew. He obtained \nsome payment deferments, but the exact timing and extent of these deferments is not \nclear from this record. Applicant reports that the collection agent for the education loans \nbegan contacting him sometime in 2014, but he took no steps to begin repayment. With \nhis own children entering college, Applicant decided to focus on handling their education \nexpenses, so as to not burden them with their own education loans. He undertook to pay \ntheir college expenses through his current income so they could acquire their educations \ndebt free. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 2017 clearance application for his periodic \nreinvestigation (GE 1), he did not include his education loans because he did not think of \nhis education loans as routine credit accounts like credit cards. However, when he was \nconfronted with the loan debt during a June 2018 interview with a Government investigator \n(GE 2), he stated his intent to contact the creditor and make payment arrangements. \nNevertheless, at the time of an October 2018 follow-up interview, he still had not contacted \nthe creditor. Applicant reached out to the creditor in January 2019 (AE B) to begin the \nprocess of rehabilitating his education loans. He entered into a rehabilitation plan in \nFebruary 2019, and made the required rehabilitation payments. At the time of the hearing, \nhe was awaiting the details of a regular repayment plan, which may involve higher monthly \npayments than required for the rehabilitation program. As of 2 November 2019, the \noutstanding loan balance was over $237,000 for the two loans. Applicant claims to have \nthe necessary income to handle whatever the new loan payment might be, and in a pinch, \nhas financial assets sufficient to pay the loans in full (AE C). With the exception of the \neducation loans, Applicant=s credit reports reflect no other financial problems (GE 3-5; AE \nD). \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant=s character references (AE A), who include two long-time coworkers, a \nlong-time friend, and his oldest child, consider him honest and trustworthy, and \nrecommend him for his security clearance. However, none of them recites any knowledge \nof the issues raised by the SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden of \npersuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of \nfinancial difficulties for which he did not undertake timely resolution.3 Applicant knew he \nhad significant delinquent education loan debt no later than 2014, yet undertook no effort \nto address the indebtedness until at least January 2019. \n \n                                                 \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n319(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. The \nfinancial problems were recent, not infrequent, and, as they were deliberate, not clearly \ndue to circumstances unlikely to recur.4 Applicant=s financial problems were due to his \ndeliberate choice to address his children=s financial obligations while ignoring his own \ndelinquent education debt. These were not circumstances beyond his control, and he was \nnot responsible in addressing the debts, even after his subject interviews.5 Applicant has \nhad no credit or financial counseling, and at best, the debt is half-way to being resolved.6 \nHis belated effort does not constitute a good-faith effort to address his debts.7 In addition, \nwhile the Applicant managed the required rehabilitation payments, and may have the \nmeans to meet whatever payment is required going forward, he has not demonstrated a \ntrack record of payments on the new plan. Furthermore, Applicant=s Awhole-person@ \nevidenceCin which none of his references appear to be aware of the SOR issuesCis \ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by his inaction on the education loans. \nAccordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \n \n  \nNevertheless, the Government did not establish a case for disqualification under \nGuideline E. Applicant misconstrued the question regarding financial difficulties and \nconsequently lacked intent to mislead the Government.8 Accordingly, I resolve Guideline \nE for Applicant. \n \n Formal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs a-b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2. Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                                                 \n4&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . .  \n5&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6&208 the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n7&20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n8 &16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . .

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n01/27/2020 \nDecision \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to overcome the security concerns \nraised by her failure to timely file her federal income tax returns for three of the last four \ntax years. She also did not address her unpaid debts despite the passage of nearly seven \nyears while having the resources to do so. Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 25, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of her employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information, as \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 \n(Directive). \n \nOn June 26, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) \nand requested a decision without a hearing. \n \nOn October 3, 2019, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained eight documents \n(Items 1 \u2013 8) on which the Government relies to establish the facts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant received the FORM on October 15, 2019, and she was informed she had 30 \ndays from the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM \nand to submit additional information in response to the FORM. Additionally, Applicant was \nspecifically advised in Section IV of the FORM that she could comment on the accuracy \nof, or object to the admission of, FORM Item 5 (Summary of Personal Subject Interview, \ndated July 20, 2018).  \n \nApplicant was granted an extension of the deadline for responding and \nsubsequently provided additional information in response to the FORM within the time \nallotted. The record closed on November 29, 2019, after Applicant responded to the \nFORM. She did not object to the consideration of any of the Government\u2019s exhibits. I \nreceived this case for decision on December 16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that as of June 26, 2019, Applicant had not yet filed her federal \nincome tax returns for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); and that she owes \n$2,857 for three delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.d). In response to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted SOR 1.a, but denied SOR 1.b \u2013 1.d. With her response she provided \nan explanatory statement and a credit report, dated July 26, 2019. (FORM, Items 1 and \n3). In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has \nworked, first as a temporary agency employee then as a permanent company employee, \nsince April 2012. She was unemployed between January 2010 and April 2012 after being \nlaid off due to a reduction in force from a previous employer. Applicant was otherwise \nsteadily employed between June 2000 and January 2010. She attributes the debts \nalleged in the SOR to her two years of unemployment. As to SOR 1.b, she averred that \nthe debt was not valid, that she disputed it (reason not specified), and that it has been \nremoved from her credit history. As to SOR 1.c and 1.d, Applicant stated that she has \nresolved both debts through a repayment agreement with the collection agency to which \nboth credit card debts had been referred. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAll three debts are documented in the credit reports produced by the Government. \nThe date of last activity or payment on those debts was in either September or October \n2012. They do not appear on a July 2019 credit report provided by Applicant with her \nAnswer. In her response to the FORM, Applicant provided information that established \nthat the SOR 1.c and 1.d debts have been satisfied. She continued to rely on the absence \nof the SOR 1.b debt from her credit history for the past two years to support her claim that \nit was removed for being invalid. Generally, the absence of an account from a credit \nreport, without more, is not sufficient to show that a debt has been resolved. In this \ninstance, in addition to Applicant\u2019s claim about SOR 1.d, the record shows she acted to \nresolve her other debts; however, the passage of more than seven years since the SOR \n1.b debt became delinquent could also suggest it is no longer being reported due to the \nFair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) statute of limitations. (FORM, Items 3, 7, and 8) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP in September 2017, she disclosed that she \nhad not yet filed her federal income tax return for the 2016 tax year because \u201cI am behind \non paperwork. (Terrible excuse).\u201d She further stated, \u201cI will file within the next 30 days.\u201d \nIn November 2018, Applicant was interviewed as part of her background investigation by \na government investigator. During the interview, she stated that she did not file her 2016 \nreturn because she had no reportable income. As discussed below, this was not true. She \nalso acknowledged that she knew she had to file a return anyway. In April 2019, in \nresponse to interrogatories about her taxes from the DOD CAF, Applicant provided \ninformation that shows she had not yet filed her federal returns for the years alleged in \nSOR 1.a. The same information showed her 2014 return was filed seven months late but \nshe did not timely file an extension when the return was first due. Also in response to the \ninterrogatories, Applicant stated her intention to file her past-due returns by July 2019. \n(FORM, Items 4 \u2013 6) \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided copies of her past-due federal \nincome tax returns. They were signed on October 1, 2019. The IRS received the returns \non November 19, 2019. As to her 2016 return, it shows she earned about $50,000 in \nreportable income that year. Applicant does not appear to owe any unpaid taxes for the \nyears at issue. She did not show that she has filed her 2018 return or if all of her state \nincome tax returns have been filed. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n4 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant did not timely comply with her federal \nincome tax reporting obligations for three of the last four tax years. The Government also \nestablished that Applicant was delinquent for almost seven years on three collection \naccounts. This information reasonably raises the security concerns articulated at AG \u00b6 \n18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n5 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nI have also considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nOf these mitigating conditions, only AG \u00b6 20(g) has any basis for application \nbecause Applicant has filed her past-due returns; however, its value is attenuated by \nApplicant\u2019s inaction until after she received the SOR. As to her debts, they may have \narisen from a period of unemployment, but Applicant has been steadily employed since \nearly 2012, yet took no action to pay two debts for nearly seven years. While she claims \nshe disputed the third debt, she offered no indication of the nature of the dispute or proof \n\n \n6 \n \nthat she actually filed a dispute with the creditor. None of Applicant\u2019s actions regarding \nher debts or her income tax returns can be considered prompt or responsible under these \ncircumstances. Applicant did not provide an acceptable reason for not filing her income \ntax returns, and the information she has provided in response to the SOR and the FORM \ndoes not show that her financial problems will not recur. On balance, Applicant has not \nmet her burden of production or persuasion to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nthe Government\u2019s information. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). My review of all of the available \ninformation leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information that were raised by her debts and by her failure to comply with basic \nincome tax reporting obligations. Her conduct regarding her tax returns more specifically \nundermines confidence in her judgment and reliability. Because protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be \nresolved against the individual. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 34 years old. He is married, and recently became a father for the first time. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in 2016. He began his current employment with a defense contractor in December 2015, working on contracts with major commercial clients. He rapidly advanced through increasingly responsible positions, and is currently a senior cybersecurity consultant. His company\u2019s vice president asked him to apply for national security eligibility so he could support ongoing and prospective Government contracts. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; AE B; Tr. 26, 28, 31-34, 46-47.) Applicant disclosed on his e-QIP that he had occasionally used tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), by smoking marijuana or eating ingestible THC products, with his wife at home or with friends in a social environment. He did this about four times a year between August 2008 and December 2016. At that point he stopped because he had agreed to apply for a security clearance. He knew then, and fully believes, that substance misuse is inconsistent with national security eligibility. His wife agrees with and shares in his abstinence from use of THC.

On June 26, \n2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4 National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which came \ninto effect June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted his written Answer to the SOR on July 12, 2019. He admitted \nthe SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on August 21, \n2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 16, 2019, setting the hearing for \nNovember 7, 2019. On that date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 and 2 into evidence. Applicant testified, and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A into \nevidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to \nleave the record open for submission of additional evidence until November 21, 2019. \nApplicant timely submitted AE B, C, and D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 19, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is married, and recently became a father for the first \ntime. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nscience in 2016. He began his current employment with a defense contractor in \nDecember 2015, working on contracts with major commercial clients. He rapidly \nadvanced through increasingly responsible positions, and is currently a senior \ncybersecurity consultant. His company\u2019s vice president asked him to apply for national \nsecurity eligibility so he could support ongoing and prospective Government contracts. \nHe never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; GE 2; AE \nA; AE B; Tr. 26, 28, 31-34, 46-47.) \nApplicant \ndisclosed \non \nhis \ne-QIP \nthat \nhe \nhad \noccasionally \nused \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), by smoking marijuana or eating ingestible THC products, \nwith his wife at home or with friends in a social environment. He did this about four times \na year between August 2008 and December 2016. At that point he stopped because he \nhad agreed to apply for a security clearance. He knew then, and fully believes, that \nsubstance misuse is inconsistent with national security eligibility. His wife agrees with and \nshares in his abstinence from use of THC. During most of the time he used THC, it was \nlegal to do so under the law of his state of residence. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 34-39, 43-44.) \nApplicant and a group of friends have attended a regional rock music concert held \nduring August each year. Marijuana was sometimes offered and shared among the \nfriends. During the 2017 concert, Applicant declined to share in the friends\u2019 marijuana use \nbecause he had applied for a security clearance and wanted to comply with the eligibility \nstandards. By August 2018, however, he had heard nothing from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), or any other government entity, concerning his January 2017 \nclearance application, and assumed that it had been denied. At the concert in 2018, with \nmarijuana use having become legal in the state and assuming there was no further \nFederal interest in his conduct, he shared in using a marijuana cigarette being smoked \nby the group. Several days later, he was contacted by an OPM investigator to schedule \nhis unsworn subject interview and realized that he was still under consideration for a \nclearance. He has not used any THC since then, including when he attended the concert \nevent in August 2019.

He rejected the advice of an attorney he consulted, \nwho suggested that he attempt to portray his August 2018 use of marijuana as a \ntemporary lapse in judgment that he did not even think about before participating when \nsomeone passed it around. He described his rejection of this advice as follows: \nTo me, an excuse such as that shows someone who's prone to making \nmistakes, bad decisions, or can be swayed to make a poor choice, which is \na serious character flaw I would expect you all to consider. In truth, I made \na calculated decision. I was well aware of my security clearance process, \nbut I had not received a statement regarding an interim clearance or any \nintent of the process moving forward. As this is the only time I have been \u2013 \nthis is the only time I've been through this process, I acted on my own \nassumption that I would not be hearing from the government regarding my \nclearance and that I must have been denied. After making that assumption, \nI made the decision to enjoy myself at a concert with friends, where we \nultimately shared a joint attending the event -- before attending the event. \nDays after the event, I received notification from an investigator about \nscheduling an interview for my security clearance. It was at that time when \nI felt immediate regret in my recent decision. (Tr. 29-30.) \nApplicant then expressed his complete acceptance of the policy that substance \nmisuse is inconsistent with national security eligibility, and his sincere reasons for wanting \nto abide by such limitations in order to fulfill his desire to contribute to Federal cloud \ncomputing and network information security efforts. (Tr. 26-29, 44-46.) After the hearing, \nhe submitted a signed and sworn declaration of his intent to permanently abstain from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, and his agreement to the immediate revocation \nof his security clearance should he be involved with or misuse drugs in the future. He has \nkept appropriate peers and supervisors within his company informed concerning his past \nuse of THC and his progress through the security clearance process. (AE B.) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisory senior vice president, and two longtime friends who hold \nresponsible leadership positions in other fields, wrote letters describing their admiration \nfor his character, integrity, and trustworthiness. Each has known him in different \ncapacities, but they uniformly praised his responsibility, dedication, and honesty. His vice \npresident noted that he has developed a reputation as, \u201ca stickler,\u201d with respect to \nobserving and expecting strict compliance with applicable rules and procedures. (AE C.) \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s two most recent performance evaluations describe his professionalism \nin meeting customer requirements, growing natural leadership role within the company, \nand successful assumption of increased responsibility as a senior consultant. He fully met \nall standards, and exceeded expectations for the majority of them during the periods \ninvolved.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nApplicant infrequently used small amounts of THC several times per year between \nAugust 2008 and December 2016. He had not used THC for several months, and decided \nto continue abstaining when he agreed to his company\u2019s January 2017 request that he \napply for a security clearance. He understands and agrees that THC use is not consistent \nwith national security eligibility. On one occasion during August 2018, under the \nerroneous assumption that his clearance had been denied, he shared a marijuana \ncigarette with some friends. The evidence supports security concerns under AG \u00b6 25(a). \nAG & 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant abused small amounts of THC several times a year in social settings \nfrom August 2008 to December 2016, and once in August 2018. This drug abuse was \ninfrequent, stopped almost two years ago, is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Substantial mitigation under \nAG & 26(a) was established. \nApplicant readily acknowledges his illegal use of THC in the past, and has \nestablished a credible pattern of abstinence since his last use in 2018. He cannot fully \ndisassociate from friends and family members who have occasionally used marijuana, \nbut he and his wife have committed to abstain from future drug involvement. He provided \na signed statement of intent to continue abstaining from THC misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nHe accordingly established persuasive mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Other potential \nmitigating conditions are inapplicable in the absence of prescription drug abuse or any \nrecommended form of drug treatment. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nfully disclosed and consistently demonstrated accountability for his relatively minor \nmisuse of THC in the past. He convincingly demonstrated his intention to abstain from \nfurther substance misuse. This is not a matter of substituting a credibility assessment for \nthe facts of this case. Applicant has been honest and forthright throughout this process, \nwhich is important to establishing and maintaining national security eligibility. That \nintegrity fortifies other strong evidence of his trustworthiness, responsibility, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress is minimal since Applicant has \nfully informed his supervisors, relevant coworkers, family, and friends about his previous \ninvolvement with THC and his decision abstain from drug involvement in the future. \nRecurrence of substance misuse is not likely. \nOverall, the evidence has eliminated any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He successfully met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDAVID M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 47 years old. He graduated from high school in 1990, and he attended college for a couple of years. In 1993, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and he received an honorable discharge in March 1997. Applicant re-enrolled in college and in 1999, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting. He married in 2001, and has four daughters, and a son, age two. (Tr. 25-26, 65-66; GE 1; AE B, AE C, AE H) Applicant was employed in September 2018 by a defense contractor as a project manager earning an annual salary of $145,000. He lost his interim DOD security clearance in June 2019, and he could no longer maintain employment with the DOD contractor. However, Applicant is still being sponsored by this employer for a DOD security clearance. In September 2019, Applicant was hired by his current employer. This company is requesting he obtain a position of trust for his current job duties as a manager. His current annual salary is $120,000.

Schachter, Esq. \n02/10/2020 \nDecision \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns arising \nfrom his failure to pay for defaulted student loans that he had cosigned despite having the \nfinancial means to do so. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.\nStatement of the Case \nOn February 28, 2018, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant filed a response to the SOR on July 25, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and \n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted seven documents with his SOR response. On September 26, 2019, the case \nwas assigned to me. On October 11, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for November 13, 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested to change the hearing date to November 12, 2019, due to \na scheduling conflict. Department Counsel did not object to the request. I granted the \nrequest and an amended notice of hearing was issued on October 30, 2019. The \nNovember 12, 2019 hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5.  \nApplicant testified, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G that were previously \nsubmitted with the SOR Response, and he also submitted an additional seven documents \nlabeled AE H-N. I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection, except \nfor GE 3, which is addressed below. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 21, 2019. The record was held open until December 11, 2019, in the event \neither party wanted to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted five \ndocuments, which I labeled AE O-S. He requested I hold the record open for an additional \nthree weeks to see if a response from the collection law firm was forthcoming. On January \n3, 2020, Applicant\u2019s counsel sent an e-mail confirming the collection law firm had not \nreplied to the two certified letters sent in November 2019, and the third certified letter sent \nin December 2019. I labeled the January 3, 2020, e-mail as AE T, admitted all post-\nhearing documents without objection, and the record closed.  (Tr. 54-55, 82-83; AE P) \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nApplicant objected to the admission of GE 3, which was a report of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview dated August 14, 2018.  He stated that the report could not be \nadmitted without an authenticating witness. Department Counsel did not have an \nauthenticating witness at the hearing.  The only portion of the Subject Interview that I \nconsidered in this decision was the section that was authenticated by Applicant at the \nhearing. Specifically, Applicant became aware in approximately June 2018 from the \nsecurity office that there were potential financial issues from a student loan collector listed \non his credit report. Applicant received this notice about two months before his \nbackground interview that took place in August 2018. Nothing further from Applicant\u2019s \nbackground report was authenticated by him, or considered by me in this decision. (Tr.12-\n13, 32-36; GE 3) \n \nApplicant made a motion for me to take administrative notice of sections 501-101 \nand 501-102, of State A\u2019s statute of limitations. State A is also the state of Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. Department Counsel did not object to the submission of State A\u2019s statute of \nlimitations, but noted that he did not believe the statute to be relevant to the three charged-\noff student loans at issue in this hearing. Department Counsel believed the three student \nloans had been guaranteed by the federal government, and all of the loans were currently \ngoverned by federal law. I ruled that I would take administrative notice of State A\u2019s statute \nof limitations, but whether the state law was applicable would later be determined by me, \nand the supporting evidence that would be presented in this case. Post-hearing \ndocuments submitted by Applicant confirmed that the student loan was a private student \nloan. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1; AE A4, AE D, AE Q, AE R)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He graduated from high school in 1990, and he attended \ncollege for a couple of years. In 1993, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and he received an \nhonorable discharge in March 1997. Applicant re-enrolled in college and in 1999, he \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting. He married in 2001, and has four daughters, \nand a son, age two. (Tr. 25-26, 65-66; GE 1; AE B, AE C, AE H) \n \n \nApplicant was employed in September 2018 by a defense contractor as a project \nmanager earning an annual salary of $145,000. He lost his interim DOD security \nclearance in June 2019, and he could no longer maintain employment with the DOD \ncontractor. However, Applicant is still being sponsored by this employer for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. In September 2019, Applicant was hired by his current employer. This \ncompany is requesting he obtain a position of trust for his current job duties as a manager. \nHis current annual salary is $120,000. His spouse is also employed making an annual \nsalary of $100,000. Applicant stated that if his DOD security clearance is granted, he will \nreapply for employment with his previous employer. (Tr. 60-63; GE 1; AE B, AE C) \n \n \nApplicant has not suffered from financial problems in the past and his credit rating \nhas been good for many years. For this very reason, Applicant was asked by a cousin to \ncosign for him on a student loan so that he could attend college. His cousin\u2019s credit rating \ndid not qualify him to obtain a student loan in his name only. Applicant could not recall \nmany details of the event since it occurred in 2004, but he cosigned the student loan \npaperwork which he thought was private, and acknowledged that he understood as a \ncosigner, he was legally responsible for the loan in the event his cousin did not make the \nloan payments. His cousin attended college, and in 2005, Applicant was asked again to \ncosign on a student loan so that his cousin could continue with his college education. \nApplicant cosigned another student loan in 2005. In 2006, when he was asked a third \ntime to cosign on a student loan, Applicant admitted that he was reluctant to do so. He \ntestified that his family members strongly urged him to cosign the third student loan, which \nhe did in 2006.  (Tr. 26-27, 55; AE F, AE I, AE K)  \n \n \nIn approximately 2010, Applicant received phone calls from Sallie Mae and \ndiscovered that his cousin had stopped making his student loan payments. Applicant \nbegan making the student loan payments in 2010. During a conversation he had with his \ncousin, he agreed to assist in making the loan payments if his cousin was unable to do \nso, however, it was not his intention to pay the student loans in full for his cousin. In about \n2011, his cousin resumed making the student loan payments, and he told Applicant that \nhe would attempt to have his name removed from the loan documents. Applicant\u2019s cousin \nfully acknowledged that it was his responsibility to pay for the student loans that enabled \nhim to attend college. (Tr. 28-30, 56-59) \n \n \nIn approximately June 2018, while Applicant was working on a government project, \nthe security office notified him there was a potential problem with three student loan \ncollection entries on his credit report. Applicant realized that his cousin must have stopped \nmaking student loan payments once again. Applicant contacted the student loan creditor, \n\n \n4 \n \nand he was given the contact information for the law firm handling the student loan \ncollection. Applicant contacted the law firm and asked how he could get these charged-\noff student loans removed from his credit report. He was advised to pay the loans. \nApplicant then asked how they would remove the negative entries from his credit report, \nbut the law firm informed him that they do not report to the credit bureau agencies. After \nhearing this, Applicant made the decision to not pay the three charged-off student loans \nsince he did not see the benefit of doing so. (Tr. 32-35, 37-40, 64-65) At the hearing he \nstated: \n \nIf I had to go back and do it all over again, I would have just paid it because \nnow when we sit here \u2013 I was on a project in June [2019] and my [interim] \nsecurity clearance was pulled and I lost a substantial amount of money \nbecause that happened. I mean, in retrospect I would have just paid it. (Tr. \n40)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a certified letter to the student loan creditor in July 2019, after \nreceipt of the SOR. The student loan creditor replied in August 2019, and informed him \nthat they could not remove the negative financial information from his credit report \nbecause the information reported was accurate and in compliance with federal law. (Tr. \n32-40, 59, 64-65; AE L, AE M) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c allege Applicant is indebted to a student loan collector in \nthe total amount of $38,438, for charged-off student loans that were opened in 2004, \n2005, and 2006. Applicant admitted these allegations in his response to the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant testified that his cousin did not graduate from college. He has suffered \nwith mental health issues and cannot repay the student loans. Applicant\u2019s primary focus \nwas to have all negative credit removed from his credit report. The same month that his \nsecurity clearance hearing was held, Applicant sent out two certified letters to the \ncollection law firm regarding the three charged-off student loans. (AE N) In the letters he \nrequested an IRS Form 1099-C if the student loan debt had been cancelled or forgiven. \nIf a 1099-C was not available, he asked for confirmation if the law firm chose not to pursue \nlegal collection due to State A\u2019s statute of limitations. If the first two scenarios were not \nvalid, Applicant asked the law firm to provide instructions on how he could arrange a \npayment plan. Applicant stated he understood that written-off student loans did not mean \nthat they were forgiven. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not received a \nresponse from the collection law firm. Post-hearing submissions provided by Applicant \nshowed a third certified letter had been sent to the collection law firm about a month after \nthe hearing. As of January 2, 2020, the collection law firm had not replied to the three \ncertified letters. (Tr. 41-48, 64; AE G, AE L, AE N) \n \n \nApplicant provided character reference letters that describe him as a reliable and \ntrustworthy employee. He is considered an honest person with integrity, and he has an \nexcellent work ethic. He has received several professional certificates and recognition for \nhis commendable service. (AE A, AE E, AE J) \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n AG \u00b6 19 includes a disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so.\u201d The SOR alleges three charged-off student loans totaling $38,438. \nApplicant was a cosigner on these loans and understood he was legally responsible to \npay the loans in the event his cousin did not do so. The above disqualifying condition \napplies. Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s only delinquent debt involves three charged-off student loans that have \nbeen delinquent for a number of years. He is current on all of his other financial \nobligations. He was fully aware that being a cosigner meant that he and the borrower \nshare the legal responsibility for repaying a loan and making sure payments are made on \ntime. In this case, Applicant agreed to be a cosigner and made it possible for his cousin \nto be approved for three student loans and pursue a college education. As cosigner, \nApplicant shares the responsibility with his cousin for on-time loan payments. If the \nborrower cannot\u2014or does not\u2014make payments, then the cosigner needs to make the \npayments for him.  \n \nTo his credit, Applicant made some payments on the student loans in 2010-2011, \nafter he was notified by Sallie Mae that his cousin was not paying the loans consistently. \nHis cousin\u2019s mental health issues and his inability to repay the student loans are \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, to receive full credit for this \nmitigating condition, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. In June 2018, Applicant was notified by the security office that a student \nloan collector was listed on his current credit report. His primary focus was to have the \nnegative financial information removed from his credit report. He did not think about his \nlegal obligation to repay the student loans he cosigned in 2004, 2005, and 2006. In fact, \nhe did not initiate a good-faith payment agreement with the law firm after he learned they \ndid not remove negative information from credit bureau reports. A year later, in June 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s interim security clearance was withdrawn due to his financial security \nconcerns, and he lost his employment.  \n \nWhether the student loans are private, or federally guaranteed, may limit the legal \nrights of the creditor to collect; however, it does not control disposition of this case.  \nAssuming the state statute of limitations caused his private student loans to be legally \nuncollectible does not necessarily mean that the creditor would refuse repayment of the \nloans. To be clear, the statute of limitations only bars the creditor from successfully suing \n\u2013 it does not end the security significance of the generation of the debt and the failure to \nresponsibly take actions to ensure repayment over the years. In the context of debt \ncollection, a statute of limitations is a set amount of time that a creditor has to sue to \ncollect an unpaid debt. A state\u2019s statute of limitations applies to private student loans but \nnot to federal student loans. Applicant\u2019s recent decision to not repay or attempt to repay \nthe cosigned student loans, whether they were private or federally guaranteed, weighs \nagainst him. When he talked to the collection law firm in 2018, he could have responsibly \naddressed the loans with a reasonable repayment plan, especially since he was \nfinancially capable of doing so. He chose not to make any good-faith efforts to repay the \ndebts.    \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s documentation showing his attempts to communicate with the creditor \nare dated after his receipt of the SOR. The full year he failed to address his financial \nobligations as cosigner of the student loans shows that he is not reliable and did not use \ngood judgment. Under the current circumstances, there are not clear indications that the \nfinancial problem is being resolved. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent attempts to communicate with a student loan creditor after the \nreceipt of the SOR does not absolve him from his past neglect of addressing student \nloans he cosigned for a family member. To his credit, he has been responsible for his \nown personal financial obligations, but his unwillingness to make good-faith efforts to \nrepay the charged-off student loans when he has the financial means to do so shows he \ncannot always be trusted to fulfill his promises.  After evaluating all the evidence in the \n\n \n9 \n \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $106,920 for 19 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.s). Twelve of the debts alleged (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.k, 1.n) are for delinquent student loans totaling $97,238, or about 90 percent of the total debt at issue. In response, Applicant admitted with brief explanation all of the SOR allegations. At the hearing, additional relevant information was produced that showed Applicant had not filed his state or federal income tax returns for the tax years 2015 through 2018. (Tr. 58 \u2013 59, 64 \u2013 66) As provided for by Directive, Section E3.1.17, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to this new information by adding a new allegation (SOR 1.t). The proposed amendment was presented as follows: 1.t You failed to timely file, as required, your federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. As of the date of this amended Statement of Reasons, the tax returns remain unfiled. (Tr. 69) Applicant did not object and I granted the motion. Additionally, he admitted the new allegation, and I left the record open for 16 days so that Applicant could provide information in response to SOR 1.t.

He is repaying his student loans through a rehabilitation program. Although he \nhas received financial counseling, he has yet to begin repaying his past-due credit card \naccounts. Additionally, he has not yet filed his federal and state income tax returns for the \ntax years 2015 through 2018. Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility to occupy a position of trust \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 6, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position for his job \nwith a federal contractor.

The current adjudicative guidelines were issued \nby the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on January 16, 2020, and scheduled the requested hearing for March \n4, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant presented Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 E, and he and one \nwitness testified. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I held the record open after \nthe hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional relevant information. The record closed \non March 23, 2020, when I received AX F \u2013 H and Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of \nobjection. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 12, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $106,920 for 19 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.s). Twelve of the debts alleged (SOR 1.a \u2013 \n1.k, 1.n) are for delinquent student loans totaling $97,238, or about 90 percent of the total \ndebt at issue. In response, Applicant admitted with brief explanation all of the SOR \nallegations. \nAt the hearing, additional relevant information was produced that showed Applicant \nhad not filed his state or federal income tax returns for the tax years 2015 through 2018. \n(Tr. 58 \u2013 59, 64 \u2013 66) As provided for by Directive, Section E3.1.17, Department Counsel \nmoved to amend the SOR to conform to this new information by adding a new allegation \n(SOR 1.t). The proposed amendment was presented as follows: \n1.t You failed to timely file, as required, your federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. As of the date of this \namended Statement of Reasons, the tax returns remain unfiled. (Tr. 69) \nApplicant did not object and I granted the motion. Additionally, he admitted the new \nallegation, and I left the record open for 16 days so that Applicant could provide \ninformation in response to SOR 1.t. (Tr. 69 \u2013 72) As noted above, Applicant provided \nthree post-hearing exhibits. Only one of those exhibits, AX G, addresses the information \npresented in SOR 1.t. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to all \nof the SOR allegations, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old and employed by a defense contractor in a position that \nrequires eligibility for a position of trust.

He also attended a technical college in 2011 and 2012. The student \nloans addressed in the SOR were obtained to pay his tuition at both colleges. He and his \nwife have been married since 2011. In addition to her 12-year-old child from before the \nmarriage, they have two children together, ages 5 and 6. Additionally, in 2014, Applicant \nand his wife were given custody of his then 15-year-old cousin who had been sexually \nmolested by her mother\u2019s boyfriend. The child joined the military when she turned 18, but \nnow has left the service and is looking for work. Applicant and his wife have provided \nsporadic financial assistance to her over the past year or so.

Applicant has worked for his current employer since September 2018. \nBetween December 2006 and October 2017, he worked in a similar position for a large \ntelecommunications company. He was involuntarily terminated for violating company \npolicies, and he was unemployed until being hired for his current position. This is his first \nrequest for position of trust eligibility. (GX 1; GX 4; Tr. 12, 41, 33) \nSince March 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife has held both a full-time and a part-time job, \nand she now earns about $72,000 annually. She was unemployed between January and \nSeptember 2014, between March and September 2015, and between May and December \n2018. Her 2014 and 2015 periods of unemployment arose from medical problems related \nto the birth of their two children. Her 2018 unemployment started when she was laid off \nfrom a previous job. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 33 \u2013 35, 51 \u2013 55) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from a combination of circumstances. His two \nchildren were born within 16 months of each other, and his wife was unable to work for \nmedical reasons for most of 2014 and 2015. His own unemployment between October \n2017 and September 2018 also created financial burdens that he struggled to carry. \nApplicant remained in good standing with his student loans until about April 2018; \nhowever, both he and his wife found themselves unemployed for most of 2018. In July \n2019, he began the process of trying to resolve those debts and, since October 2019, has \nbeen making monthly payments through a student-loan rehabilitation program. \nSatisfactory participation in that program will bring his loans current. As of February 2020, \nthe total due, with interest and penalties, for all 12 accounts was $120,359. (GX 4; AX A; \nAX B; Tr. 37 \u2013 39, 55 \u2013 56) \nDuring his wife\u2019s unemployment in 2014 and 2015, Applicant resorted to using \ncredit cards to make ends meet. He eventually became unable to pay those accounts as \nrequired. Between 2016 and 2018, the accounts were either charged off as business \nlosses or referred for collection. The debts alleged at SOR 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o \u2013 1.s reflect \nthose debts, which total $9,682. In January 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator as part of Applicant\u2019s background investigation. During the \ninterview, he discussed all of the debts alleged in the SOR and stated that his intent to \nresolve his debts within two years by saving money and reducing expenses, such as \nmoving his children from private school to public school.

The budget he submitted post-hearing does not reflect \nany debt payments other than his student-loan rehabilitation payments. Additionally, it \nreflects a negative monthly cash flow of about $100 after deducting expenses from \nApplicant\u2019s pay alone. He earns $43,000 annually. With his wife\u2019s income, the total \nhousehold income is about $115,000 annually. It is unclear what access Applicant has to \nhis wife\u2019s income to resolve debts and to pay unplanned expenses. Applicant testified \nthat the net remainder each month is actually about $150. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; AX C; AX \nF; AX G; Tr. 33 \u2013 36, 43 \u2013 48) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s testimony about the state of his current monthly finances, \nApplicant revealed that he had not filed his federal or state income tax returns for the \n2015 through the 2018 tax years. Applicant had not disclosed this information in his e-\nQIP, and it was not discussed during his January 2019 interview. In July 2019, Applicant \nand his wife (they have always filed joint returns) started working with a tax-debt-relief \nand tax-preparation company to resolve their past-due tax filings and any unpaid tax debt \nthat may result. Applicant did not present any additional information regarding the status \nof his past-due returns. (AX G; Tr. 58 \u2013 59, 64 \u2013 67) \nApplicant has a good reputation in the workplace. In February 2020, he was \npromoted on the strength of his job performance and professional expertise. (AX D; Tr. \n33 \u2013 36) \nPolicies \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix A, Paragraph 1(d) requires \nthat a decision to grant eligibility for a position of public trust must be \u201cclearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security.\u201d All such adjudications must adhere to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any adverse determination may be made. \nEach decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination based on \nexamination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the \npertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the adjudicative guidelines. (Directive, 6.3) \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the following factors, commonly referred to \nas the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, listed in the guidelines at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a position of \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has access to \nsensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on \ntrust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access should be resolved in favor of the Government. \n \nAdditionally, when applying the adjudicative guidelines, the presence or absence \nof a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. Nonetheless, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them \nas they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of eligibility for a position \nof trust. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe facts established by this record reasonably raise a trustworthiness concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is addressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant accrued significant delinquent and \npast-due debt starting in 2016. The record also shows that Applicant did not file any \nincome tax returns for the 2015 through 2018 tax years. This information requires \napplication of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required). \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and \nlargely unresolved. Although Applicant is addressing his student loan debts through a \nrehabilitation program, his efforts in that regard are still in their nascent stages and he \nhas not established a sufficient track record of consistent payments to resolve more than \n$120,000 in educational debt. Additionally, because Applicant has yet to directly address \nhis delinquent credit card debts, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant benefits from AG \u00b6 20(c) because he has been working with a financial \ncounselor since August 2019 and has introduced structure to his financial management \nthat may not have existed previously. Nonetheless, as shown by a negative monthly cash \nflow and the absence of credit-card debt payments, he did not establish clear indications \nthat his financial problems are under control. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nAs to his taxes, Applicant did not present any information that supports application \nof AG \u00b6 20(g). Even though he contacted a tax-resolution service last year, there is no \nindication in this record that any past-due returns have been filed or that he is working \nwith federal and state tax authorities to resolve this issue. \nAll of the foregoing precludes application of AG \u00b6 20(b). Although Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems arose from unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances, he did not \nestablish that he acted responsibly in the face of those circumstances. Based on the \nrecord evidence as a whole, none of the pertinent mitigating conditions apply, and the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised under this guideline are not resolved. \nI have evaluated the facts and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors \nunder Guidelines E and F. I also have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is a conscientious, responsible \nhusband, father, and employee. He also is starting to take the steps necessary to resolve \nhis financial problems. Nonetheless, this positive information does not outweigh the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information. His debts remain \nlargely unaddressed, and he has not sufficiently acted to resolve his past-due income tax \nreturns. Therefore, doubts about his trustworthiness remain. Because protection of the \nnational interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must \nbe resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.t:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to occupy a position of trust.

Notwithstanding, his wife, mother, and five other \nsiblings are permanent U.S. residents. On balance, because of his relationships and \nloyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 20, 2017, \nseeking clearance eligibility for a position as a linguist with a federal contractor. After \nreviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on September 4, 2019, \nalleging security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant answered \nthe SOR on November 9, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on February 6, 2020. On February 18, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for April 1, 2020. In mid-March 2020, the hearing was cancelled because of \n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOD workplace and travel restrictions based on health concerns posed by the COVID-\n19 virus. \n \nOn July 20, 2020, DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing was rescheduled for \nAugust 5, 2020. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. GE 4 (Request for \nAdministrative Notice concerning the Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq)) and GE 5 \n(Discovery Letter) were marked and made part of the record.  Applicant submitted \nexhibits (AE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objections. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 17, 2020. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts \nconcerning the Federal Republic of Iraq, its internal and external affairs, and its relations \nwith the United States, to determine whether foreign influence security concerns are \nraised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. (GE 4) Applicant did not object to me taking \nadministrative notice of those facts, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion.  \n \nIn Guideline B cases, I am required to consider, among other things, the nature \nof a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord to assess the likelihood that an applicant or his family members are vulnerable to \npressure or coercion. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the source \ndocuments included in GE 4 and will not be repeated here. I note; however, that the \nU.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq due to \nterrorism and armed conflict.\u201d Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups, criminals, and \nmilitias are active in Iraq and regularly attack Iraqi citizens and threaten U.S. personnel \nand interests in Iraq. Human rights abuses continue without punishment for those \ninvolved. \n \nAt hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.b to conform it to the \nevidence presented by deleting the word \u201cAustria,\u201d and replacing it with the word \u201cIraq.\u201d \nWithout objections, the motion was granted as requested. (Tr. 22 -23) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a (that his sister is a citizen-resident \nof Iraq). He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b (that his brother is a citizen of Iraq \nresiding in Austria), because his brother is currently residing in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s SOR \nadmissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant, his parents, five brothers, and two sisters were born and raised in Iraq. \nHis father died in 1990. (Tr. 37) His mother is a U.S. permanent resident living in the \nUnited States. She owns the family home in Iraq, a two bedroom house, with an \nestimated value between $200,000 and $400,000. Applicant testified that no one is \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncurrently residing in that property. He does not know who would inherit it at his mother\u2019s \ndeath. (Tr. 41 -42) \n \nApplicant, 36, was educated in Iraq and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in January \n2007. He testified that while in high school and college, he sometimes volunteered as a \ntranslator for U.S. personnel. Applicant was issued an Iraqi passport in January 2007, \nand he used it to travel to Syria that same year. He also used his Iraqi passport to travel \nfrom the United States to Canada in June 2012. His Iraqi passport expired in July 2015. \n \nBetween July 2007 and January 2009, Applicant worked as an interpreter for a \nfederal contractor providing services to U.S. personnel in Iraq. He knew the job had \nrisks associated with it, but the pay was good and he had no other employment \nopportunities. He believed that taking the job was his commitment to helping the Iraqi \npeople and the United States. Applicant received three recommendations from U.S. \npersonnel that supervised him when he worked as an interpreter in Iraq. (AE 1 and 2) \n \nIn 2009, Applicant received a threat from the Al Mahdi Army because of his work \nfor the United States. The threatening letter included bullets and a note indicating that \nthey knew he was working for the United States and they would get him. Applicant \nprovided the letter to U.S. authorities investigating the threat. (Tr. 54 \u2013 55) After the \nthreat, he moved from his mother\u2019s home to one of his brother\u2019s residence. Applicant \nwas granted refugee status and immigrated to the United States on September 9, 2010. \nHe was granted permanent residency a year later, and became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in June 2016.  \n \nBetween November 2010 and April 2011, Applicant worked selling pizza. He then \nworked for a company from April 2011 to May 2016. In April 2016, Applicant paid \n$247,000 in cash for a home (currently in his name). He explained that he saved most \nof the money from his earnings and that all of his siblings contributed money to buy the \nproperty. Although it is in his name, Applicant considers the property as his mother\u2019s \nproperty \u2013 as the family\u2019s home. His mother and five siblings live in the home. \n \nApplicant was unemployed between May 2016 and August 2017, and supported \nhimself with his state\u2019s unemployment benefits. A federal contractor offered him a \nposition as a linguist in Iraq in March 2017. The offer is contingent on Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. He submitted his first security clearance application \non April 20, 2017. While waiting for his clearance, Applicant was hired in August 2017, \nas a technical specialist by his current employer, a large U.S. software-hardware \nmanufacturing company. (Tr. 57 \u2013 58)  \n \nApplicant married his wife in March 2020, and they are expecting a baby. She is \na 30-year-old, Iraqi-born, permanent U.S. resident. Her father was a major in the Iraqi \nArmy. He was threatened by an Iraqi militia, and her family fled to Egypt. She and her \nbrother were granted refugee status and entered the United States in 2012. She \nbecame a U.S. permanent resident in 2013, and applied for her naturalization in May \n2020. Applicant anticipates her naturalization in the near future. (Tr. 57 - 60) Her \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmother, father, and sister are still in Egypt seeking refugee status or to immigrate to the \nUnited States. (Tr. 59 \u2013 60) \n \nApplicant owns a car and is renting an apartment for himself and his wife. He \nindicated that he currently has no savings, but has about $4,000 in a retirement \naccount. He is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in cyber security at a U.S. university.  \n \nApplicant has four brothers (ages 32, 49, 54, and 57) and one sister (age 56), \nthat are permanent U.S. residents living with his mother in the family home in the United \nStates. One of Applicant\u2019s brothers, age 56, is currently a citizen-resident of Iraq. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b) Applicant went to live with this brother after he was threatened in 2009 for \nworking as a U.S. interpreter. Apparently, his brother was afraid for his life and also fled \nto Austria seeking refugee status. Austria denied his request for asylum, and his brother \nreturned to Iraq where he currently resides with his wife and three children. He is a taxi \ndriver. Applicant testified that in 2012, he also applied for refugee status for his brother \nand sister in Iraq, but it was not granted. Applicant traveled to Austria in 2016 and \nstayed with his brother for about one week. Applicant communicates with his brother \nonce or twice a month via social media.  \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s sisters, age 51, is a citizen-resident of Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nDuring his counterintelligence focused security screening interview (interview), \nApplicant stated that his family disowned his sister because she married his cousin and \nthe family did not approve. (GE 2) However, in October 2015, his sister sent Applicant \n$10,000 from Iraq to help support the family in the United States. (GE 3; Tr. 44 - 45) \nCurrently, Applicant and this sister have telephonic contact every two weeks. However, \nhis other siblings and mother have daily contact with his sister in Iraq. (Tr. 33 \u2013 34) \nAccording to Applicant, his sister\u2019s husband is retired. He used to work for the Iraqi \ngovernment in a shoe factory.  \n \nDuring his June 2017 interview (GE 2), Applicant stated that he was a citizen of \ntwo countries, Iraq and the United States. When questioned further, he stated he \nconsiders the U.S. his country and that he would never betray the United States. He \nexpressed that it was his dream as a child to come to the United States. He believes he \nearned his right to be a U.S. citizen when he risked his life working for the United \nStates, and that he and his family endured hardships to come to the United States. \nWhen questioned about renouncing his Iraqi citizenship, Applicant replied \u201cthe U.S. \nallows me to have both.\u201d He later qualified that he would renounce his Iraqi citizenship if \nrequired for his position. Applicant believes that he is not subject to any foreign \ninfluence because his family lives in the United States. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has friends that are officers in the Iraqi Army \u2013 one is a \nmajor and the other a lieutenant. (Tr. 38 \u2013 39) They became friends while he was in \ncollege. He communicates with them infrequently via internet and social media.  \n \nConcerning Iraq, I took administrative notice that the U.S. Department of State \nwarns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous and the ability of the U.S. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEmbassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk \nfor kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active \nin Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias and criminal elements may also threaten U.S. citizens and \nwestern companies throughout Iraq.  \n \n \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \n  \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two siblings are citizen-residents of Iraq. He maintains a close \nrelationship with his relatives in Iraq as demonstrated by his and his family\u2019s frequent \ncontacts and communications with them. His brother currently residing in Iraq fled to \nanother country because he was afraid for his life after Applicant was identified as a \nU.S. interpreter. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s family has a property in Iraq with a value \nbetween $200,000 and $400,000. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:     \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country \n. . . that could subject the individual to possible future exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nThere is substantial evidence of a significant threat of terror, sectarian violence, \ncriminal activity, and ongoing human rights problems in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts may create a potential conflict of interest, and there is evidence of a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to his siblings, their connections to \nIraq, and the property in Iraq are sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(f).  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:   \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq as well as each individual \nfamily tie. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nTravel within Iraq remains very dangerous and the ability of the Iraqi government \nor the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are \nat high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent \ngroups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias and criminal elements may also threaten U.S. citizens and \nwestern companies throughout Iraq. Severe human rights problems are widespread in \nIraq. Sectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of \ngovernment and society weakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective \nhuman rights protections.  \n \n \nBecause of his relatives and property interests in Iraq, Applicant could be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a family member, his property \ninterests in Iraq, and the interests of the United States. However, there is no evidence of \nany actions taken by any Iraqi person, group, organization, or government interest \nagainst his siblings living in Iraq since Applicant or his sibling in the United States left \nIraq. \n \n \nApplicant immigrated in 2009, and most of his immediate family members \nimmigrated to the United States in 2012. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nand his mother and siblings are currently permanent U.S. residents. His mother and \nsiblings live in a home all of them purchased together. Applicant\u2019s two siblings in Iraq \napplied for refugee status and their application is pending. I note that Applicant received \nfavorable recommendations from U.S. personnel that supervised him when he worked \nas an interpreter in Iraq. \n \n \nApplicant recently married and his wife is expecting their first child. While waiting \nfor a linguist position with a federal contractor, Applicant has been working full-time for a \nU.S. company, and he seeking a master\u2019s degree in a U.S. university. He offered to \nresign his Iraqi citizenship, if necessary to obtain his linguist position. \n \n \nI considered that Applicant\u2019s mother (or Applicant\u2019s family) have a property in \nIraq worth between $200,000 and $400,000. Applicant\u2019s and his siblings\u2019 interests in \nthat property would not accrue until his mother\u2019s passing. Thus, at this point, his interest \nin the property is speculative and likely he would be entitled to only a percentage of the \nvalue of the property. According to his testimony, the property if vacant and it is \noverseen by his brother in Iraq. Considering that most of the Applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily member are currently living in the \u201cfamily home\u201d in the United States. (except for \ntwo siblings in Iraq), I believe that Applicant\u2019s interest in the Iraqi property is unlikely to \nresult in a conflict of interest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, \nor pressure him. \n \n \nOn balance, I find that Applicant submitted sufficient evidence of his ties to the \nUnited States. There is no conflict of interest because Applicant has established \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. He can be expected to \nresolve any possible conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. His most important \nfamily interests all reside in the United States.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n   \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

He denied SOR \nallegation \u00b6 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor \u201cfor over 30 years,\u201d and has held a security \nclearance for those 30-plus years. (TR at page 19 line 18 to page 21 line 4.) He is \nrecently divorced, and has three adult children. (TR at page 21 line 14 to page 24 line \n8.)

(TR at page 23 line 4 to page 24 line 5.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. Applicant admits a former past-due credit-card debt, incurred by his former \nspouse without his knowledge, in the amount of about $30,000. (TR at page 28 line 17 \nto page 30 line 21.) Through the auspices of a legal mediator; he paid this debt in \nAugust of 2020, as evidenced by documentation from this legal mediator (AppX F at \npage 2.) \n1.b. Applicant admits a former, past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $3,492. (TR at page 31 line 16 to page 32 line 21.) Through the auspices of the \nsame legal mediator noted above; he paid this debt in January of 2020, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from this legal mediator (AppX F at page 2.) \n1.c. Applicant admits a former, past-due debt to Creditor C in the amount of \nabout $4,648. (TR at page 32 line 22 to page 35 line 2.) Through the auspices of the \nsame legal mediator noted above; he paid this debt in November of 2018, as evidenced \nby documentation from this legal mediator (AppX F at page 2.) \n1.d. Applicant admits a past-due debt on a second mortgage in the amount of \nabout $58,000. (TR at page 26 line 22 to page 27 line 4, and at page 34 line 20 to page \n36 line 8.) Through the auspices of the same legal mediator noted above, Applicant is \nmaking monthly payments of $1,824 towards this debt, which will be paid off on March \n1, 2021. (TR at page 38 line 24 to page 39 line 9.) This is evidenced by documentation \nfrom this legal mediator (AppX D.) \n1.e. Applicant denies his ex-spouse\u2019s medical debt in the amount of about \n$1,047. (TR at page 22 line 17 to page 34 line 19.) This debt also does not appear on \nApplicant\u2019s most recent October 2020 credit report. (GX 10.)

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had significant, past-due debt, and also a second mortgage towards \nwhich he is still making payments. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has addressed admitted financial difficulties, which he can attribute to a \ndivorce. Only one past-due debt remains that will also soon be paid. He has \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. Financial Considerations are found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the work place, as evidenced by six letters of recommendation. He \nalso lives within his means as reflected by a monthly budget. (AppX H.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM, which includes an October 25, 2014 pronouncement from the then Director of National Intelligence that marijuana use remains unlawful under federal law, and that changes to state laws regarding the use of marijuana do not alter existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Item 9), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 29 years old and divorced after a marriage of less than six months. A high school graduate, Applicant attended college for two semesters before dropping out in November 2009. Applicant then worked at a nursing home, initially as a dishwasher and then as a certified nursing assistant until August 2012, when she enlisted in the United States military. Applicant injured herself and could not complete basic training. She was discharged for medical reasons in October 2012. (Items 3-4.) Applicant worked as a certified nursing assistant at a different nursing facility from October 2012 to July 2014 when she was fired over a disagreement with the center\u2019s 3 director, apparently involving the use of bedding supplies on the midnight shift. For the next two years, she was employed in customer service for a hotel. From July 2016 to March 2018, Applicant was an assistant manager at a pizza restaurant.

Her use and \npurchase of marijuana since October 2016 was with a medical marijuana card. She intends \nto continue to use marijuana daily to treat her medical conditions as long as she has a \nmedical marijuana card. Her drug use violates federal law and is contrary to Department of \nDefense (DOD) policy. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The SOR explained \nwhy the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue eligibility for a public trust position for her. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n\n2 \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \nOn August 6, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 28, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including documents identified \nas Items 1 through 9. Items 6 through 9 consist of memoranda concerning the federal \ngovernment\u2019s position regarding the use of marijuana, including for medical purposes. In \nthe FORM, the Government amended Item 1, the SOR, to correct Applicant\u2019s first name in \nconformity with the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s Answer (Item 2) and security clearance \napplication (SCA) (Item 3). The Government forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on \nOctober 30, 2019, and instructed her that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on November 13, 2019. No response to the FORM was \nreceived by the December 13, 2019 deadline. On January 15, 2020, the case was assigned \nto me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \na public trust position for Applicant. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used medical cannabis with \nvarying frequency from about October 2012 to July 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that she was \narrested in December 2015 and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and \npossession of 2.5 to 10 grams of cannabis (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that she purchased medical \ncannabis from about October 2012 to October 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that she intends to \ncontinue to use medical cannabis in the future (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Item 1.) When Applicant \nanswered the SOR allegations, she admitted the use and possession of medical cannabis \nas alleged and that she intends to continue to use medical cannabis in the future. She \nstated in response to SOR \u00b6 1.d, \u201cI deny, was only charged with possession.\u201d (Item 2.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes an October 25, 2014 pronouncement \nfrom the then Director of National Intelligence that marijuana use remains unlawful under \nfederal law, and that changes to state laws regarding the use of marijuana do not alter \nexisting National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Item 9), I make the following findings of \nfact: \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and divorced after a marriage of less than six months. A \nhigh school graduate, Applicant attended college for two semesters before dropping out in \nNovember 2009. Applicant then worked at a nursing home, initially as a dishwasher and \nthen as a certified nursing assistant until August 2012, when she enlisted in the United \nStates military. Applicant injured herself and could not complete basic training. She was \ndischarged for medical reasons in October 2012. (Items 3-4.) \n \n \n Applicant worked as a certified nursing assistant at a different nursing facility from \nOctober 2012 to July 2014 when she was fired over a disagreement with the center\u2019s \n\n3 \n \ndirector, apparently involving the use of bedding supplies on the midnight shift. For the next \ntwo years, she was employed in customer service for a hotel. From July 2016 to March \n2018, Applicant was an assistant manager at a pizza restaurant. After a short stint as a \nhotel housekeeper, Applicant started working in June 2018 as a unit coordinator for a \ndefense contractor providing services for the Defense Health Agency. (Item 3.) \n \n \nOn October 18, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for eligibility for a public trust position. \nApplicant responded affirmatively to a police record inquiry concerning whether she had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. She disclosed that she had \nbeen charged with misdemeanor possession of cannabis (2.5 to 10 grams) in December \n2015, and fined for the offense in approximately October 2016. (Item 3.) \n \n \nIn response to an inquiry on her October 2018 SF 86 concerning whether she had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, Applicant \nindicated that she used \u201cTHC\u201d (tetrahydrocannabinol) from October 2012 to October 2018 \nand stated, \u201cI have a medical cannabis card.\u201d She answered \u201cYes\u201d to whether she intends \nto use THC in the future and explained, \u201cI have [an] eligible medical condition that allows \nme.\u201d (Item 3.) Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card in October 2016 that legally \nauthorized her to use and possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis until October 2019. (Items \n4-5.) \n \n \nOn January 16, 2019, Applicant was interviewed under oath by an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant disclosed that she \nfirst tried marijuana when she was discharged from the military for medical reasons. She \nstated that disillusionment from being denied a military career, and because of peer \npressure, she accepted an offer of a \u201cjoint\u201d from a friend while they were out walking in \nOctober 2012. She admitted that she used marijuana recreationally approximately 20 times \nwith her now former spouse between 2012 and 2016. The marijuana was obtained from a \ndealer, whose name Applicant could not recall. Applicant stated that after obtaining her \nmedical marijuana card in October 2016, she acquired her marijuana at a dispensary. She \ndescribed her current use as approximately half of a marijuana cigarette every evening \nbefore bed. She denied any intention to use marijuana or other drug recreationally in the \nfuture, but expressed that she would continued to use marijuana as long as she has a valid \nmarijuana card. Applicant explained that if her marijuana card is not renewed on its \nexpiration in October 2019, she would pursue conventional methods to treat her medical \nconditions. About her December 2015 arrest, Applicant reportedly recollected that she had \nsmoked a marijuana cigarette about two hours before being stopped for a license plate \nviolation; that she was charged with cannabis possession and drug paraphernalia \npossession; that the paraphernalia possession charge was dismissed; and that she was \nplaced on 12 months of supervision and paid fine and court costs of between $750 and \n$1,500 for the drug possession. (Item 4.) \n \n \nOn July 10, 2019, Applicant responded to interrogatories from DOHA. In response to \na drug-use inquiry, Applicant indicated that she used marijuana between October 2012 and \nJuly 9, 2019, that she uses it \u201ceveryday,\u201d and that she intends to continue to use it \n\n4 \n \n\u201cmedically.\u201d She denied any association with persons who use illegal drugs, any \ninvolvement in illegal purchase or sale of drugs, and any counseling or treatment to abstain \nfrom the use of drugs. She denied making any lifestyle changes conducive to abstinence \nand explained, \u201cI currently have a medical cannabis card, no changes as far as continued \nuse for medical purposes.\u201d Applicant again expressed an intention to continue to use \nmarijuana as long as she has a medical marijuana card. (Item 4.) \n \n \n With the interrogatories, Applicant was provided for her review a summary of her \nJanuary 2019 interview with the OPM investigator. Applicant indicated the summary was \ninaccurate in some aspects. She denied any report or inference that she had purchased \nmarijuana illegally and, about her arrest, she stated that she was \u201ccharged with \nparaphernalia,\u201d and that the possession charge was dismissed. She added the following: \n \nI was charged before I had my medical card, but was using marijuana for \nmedical purposes before any charge. I currently still have my medical card \nand plan to renew it as of October 2019. (Item 4.) \n \n \nWith her receipt of the FORM on November 13, 2019, Applicant was informed of the \nDOD\u2019s policies and Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2019s prosecutorial guidance regarding the \nuse of marijuana for recreational or medicinal purposes, including the following: \n \n\uf0be While some states have decriminalized or legalized limited recreational use or have \nauthorized the use of marijuana for specific medical conditions, marijuana is a \nSchedule I controlled drug under federal law (no accepted medical use) and remains \nillegal. \n \n\uf0be Executive Order 12564 mandates a drug-free workplace and drug-free federal \nworkforce. \n \n\uf0be An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of \nmarijuana remains relevant in adjudicating his or her eligibility for occupying a \nsensitive national security position, notwithstanding DOJ guidance that it is an \ninefficient use of limited federal resources to prosecute individuals who comply with \nexisting state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana. \n \n\uf0be Federal agencies are statutorily prohibited from granting or renewing national \nsecurity eligibility for any covered individual who is an unlawful user of a controlled \nsubstance or is an addict. (Items 6-9.) \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any information in response to the FORM. Based on her \nstated intention to continue to use marijuana while she had a medical marijuana card, it is \nlikely (although not conclusively established) that she continued to use and purchase \nmarijuana to at least October 2019. The record before me is silent as to whether she \nrenewed her medical marijuana card in October 2019. \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with national security. The Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November \n14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by \nthe Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of \nDefense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is \u201can examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a \nnumber of variables\u201d known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. \n \nThe person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \n\n6 \n \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant started using marijuana recreationally in October 2012. She used the drug \nabout 20 times before she obtained a medical marijuana card in October 2016. Even if she \nused marijuana for medical reasons before she obtained her medical marijuana card, it \ndoes not alter the fact that her use between October 2012 and October 2016 was illegal \nunder federal and state law. She continued to use marijuana after being arrested for \npossession of cannabis and drug paraphernalia in December 2015. She used and \npurchased marijuana from a dispensary with a medical marijuana card from October 2016 \nthrough at least July 2019, in violation of federal law. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \n\u201cany substance misuse (see above definition),\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled \nsubstance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d apply. Moreover, Applicant admitted in July 2019 that \nshe intends to continue to use medical marijuana in the future with a medical marijuana \ncard and to renew her medical marijuana card scheduled to expire in October 2019. AG \u00b6 \n25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to continue such misuse,\u201d also applies. \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 \n26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nan individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility;  \n \n\n7 \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant used marijuana about 20 times \nover four years before obtaining her medical marijuana card in October 2016. Her \nmarijuana use became daily and continued to at least July 2019. Applicant may not have \nknown as of her January 2019 subject interview, or as of her July 2019 response to \ninterrogatories, that her legal use of medical marijuana under state law is illegal under \nfederal law and prohibited by DOD policy. She maintained in January 2019 that she would \nnot use marijuana if her medical marijuana card is not renewed and that she would, in that \ncase, pursue conventional methods to treat her medical conditions. She indicated in July \n2019 that she would continue using marijuana as long as she had a medical marijuana \ncard. As of her receipt of the FORM in November 2019, Applicant could not longer \nreasonably believe that using marijuana is somehow permitted by the DOD if one has a \nstate-issued medical marijuana card. She was placed on notice that state law does not alter \nexisting federal law, DOD policy, or security guidelines regarding marijuana\u2019s illegality. She \nchose not to respond to the FORM. There is no evidence that she has ceased using \nmarijuana, or of lifestyle changes sufficient to rule out the risk of future marijuana use. The \ndrug involvement and substance misuse trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on her to \nprovide sufficient information about her circumstances to show that she has put her drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse behind her, and she failed to do so. Whether or not she \nrenewed her medical marijuana card in October 2019, her recent marijuana possession and \nuse in violation of federal law casts serious doubts about her good judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to \n\n8 \n \nthe evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/13/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations and drug involvement and substance misuse. Eligibility for a public trust \nposition is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 19, 2018, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 25, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She \nresponded to those interrogatories on August 8, 2019. On October 28, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals \nwho require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and detailed reasons \nwhy the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a \ncontract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated November 21, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, \nand she elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by DOHA on January 21, 2020, and she was afforded an opportunity after \nreceipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM \non January 29, 2020. Her response was due on February 28, 2020. Applicant chose not \nto respond to the FORM, for as of March 10, 2020, no response had been received. The \ncase was assigned to me on March 10, 2020. The record closed on March 10, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the \nSOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nwith her current employer, initially as a bilingual medical service coordinator since \nJanuary 2017, and subsequently as a customer service lead since November 2018.  A \n2006 high school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She has \nnever served with the U.S. military. She has never been married, but she has been \ncohabiting since 1990. She has no children. \n \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant has a lengthy negative employment history with repeated incidents that \nresulted in her termination from employment by various employers: as a cashier in 2009 \nfor appearing at work hungover with a verified blood alcohol content of 0.04; as a loan \noriginator in 2010 when her position was purportedly eliminated; as a consultative sales \nassociate in 2012 for unsatisfactory performance; as a bartender in 2012 following a drug-\nrelated arrest; as a bilingual human resources administrator in 2014 for unsatisfactory \nperformance; and as a bilingual debt collector in 2016 for a policy violation and \nunfavorable employment and conduct. (Item 5, at 5; Item 4, at 15-25)  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nWhen Applicant completed her April 2018 e-QIP, she acknowledged that she had \nfailed to file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2015 and 2016 \nbecause she was unable to do so online, and because she did not have sufficient funds \nto pay her income taxes at the appropriate times. (Item 4, at 46-47) When she was \ninterviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in \nJanuary 2019, she admitted that she still had not made any attempts to file her income \ntax returns or to pay any income taxes that she might owe for those years. (Item 5, at 5) \nWhen she submitted her responses to the interrogatories on August 8, 2019, she again \nconfirmed that she still had not filed her federal and state income tax returns, and that \nshe did not have an installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (Item \n5, at 11-13) She did, however, submit a Request for Transcript of Tax Return (Form 4506-\nT) to the IRS seeking account transcripts for the years in question. There was no transcript \nfor the tax year 2015 submitted with her responses to the interrogatories, but there was \none for the tax year 2016, and it reflected that as of July 31, 2019, no tax return had been \nfiled. (Account Transcript, dated July 31, 2019, attached to the responses to the \ninterrogatories) In her November 2019 Answer to the SOR, she admitted that her federal \nand state income tax returns for those two years had still not been filed. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because she \ndid not report her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly \nremainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no \nevidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of any \nfinancial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than she had been.  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. She used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, estimated at 10 to 15 times per year, from about September 2004 when she \nwas in high school, and she continued using it through college until at least December \n2017, when she was 29 years old. She used marijuana socially with other individuals. \nShe generally used it when it was passed around, but on occasion, she purchased it from \nindividual sources that she claimed she could not recall. (Item 4, at 42-43; Item 5, at 4-5) \nHer relationship with marijuana resulted in two arrests: \n \n\u2022On December 12, 2012, when she was 24 years old, she was arrested and \ncharged with (1) possession of marijuana less than 200 grams, a felony; (2) maintaining \na drug trafficking place, a felony; and (3) possession of drug paraphernalia, a \nmisdemeanor. On October 29, 2013, she was entered into a diversion program, and \ncharges (2) and (3) were dismissed, and charge (1) was deferred upon probation by \njudgment. On May 8, 2015, charge (1) was dismissed. (Item 6) She claimed that she was \n\u201cunintentionally involved as [her] boyfriend was selling marijuana at [her] apartment while \n[she] was at work.\u201d She added that she \u201cwould not have allowed that to happen at [her] \nplace of residence had [she] known.\u201d (Item 4, at 43) Nevertheless, she continued using \nmarijuana for another five years. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n\u2022On January 16, 2013, she was arrested and charged with (1) bail jumping, a \nfelony, and (2) possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor. The charges were \ndismissed on August 28, 2015. (Item 6) Applicant explained that the charges were related \nto a positive drug test that occurred during her placement in the diversion program \nfollowing her December 2012 arrest. (Item 5, at 4) \n \nApplicant was never required to attend any drug-related counseling, education, or \ntreatment. (Item 5, at 5) She claims that she no longer associates with anyone who uses \ndrugs \u201cas she has since grown up and is more mature. (Item 5, at 5) Moreover, she stated \nthat she does \u201cnot plan on using, purchasing or distributing drugs in the future as [she \nhas] matured in the last few years . . . .\u201d (Item 5, at 17)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to such information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d  \n \nDOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  In this regard, \nit should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated \nNovember 19, 2004, covers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. \nThe memorandum directed DOHA to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor \ncases for trustworthiness determinations.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in \nthe record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax years \n2015 and 2016, claiming that she was unable to do so online, and because she did not \nhave sufficient funds to pay her income taxes at the appropriate times. As of July 31, \n2019, according to the IRS, no tax return had been filed for the tax year 2016. In her \nNovember 2019 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the federal and state income \ntax returns for the tax years 2015 and 2016 had still not been filed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. An applicant who begins to resolve his or \nher financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance, \nand by inference, his or her public trust position, is in jeopardy, may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed her e-QIP in April 2018; underwent her OPM interview in January \n2019; answered her interrogatories in August 2019; the SOR was issued in October 2019; \nand the FORM was sent to her in January 2020. Each step of the trustworthiness review \nprocess placed her on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting her. \nShe took no actions regarding her unfiled federal income tax returns until she filed her \nrequest for the federal transcripts in July 2019. She offered no evidence that she took any \naction with respect to the state income tax returns. As of the date that she answered the \nSOR in November 2019, the federal and state income tax returns still remained unfiled. \nShe offered no update as to the status of those income tax returns in response to the \nFORM.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \n[sensitive] information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002). As we have noted in the past, a [trustworthiness] adjudication is not \ndirected at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing \nan applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to \nfulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to [sensitive] \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, \n284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise \ntrustworthiness concerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. She purchased, \npossessed and used marijuana, a controlled substance, with varying frequency, over a \n13-year period, reportedly ending as recently as December 2017. She claimed that she \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \ngenerally used marijuana socially with others. She was arrested on two separate \noccasions for drug-related incidents. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nNeither condition applies. Applicant used marijuana for over 13 years, reportedly \nending as recently as December 2017. There was nothing infrequent about her marijuana \nuse, and there is no evidence to indicate that it happened under such circumstances that \nit was unlikely to recur. In fact, even after she was arrested and charged with drug-related \nfelonies and a misdemeanor, and placed into a diversion program, she continued using \nmarijuana, and she was caught doing so when she tested positive for marijuana as part \nof the diversion program. Although she contended that the 2012 arrest was due to her \nboyfriend\u2019s activities at her residence, activities that she claimed she would not have \napproved of, she continued using marijuana for five more years. While she now \nacknowledges her past drug involvement, she claims to have no intention of future drug \ninvolvement.  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. In \nthis instance, she used marijuana for 13 years, with the most recent drug involvement \nand substance misuse taking place in December 2017. Continued abstinence is to be \nencouraged, but the relatively brief period of such abstinence is in stark contrast to the \nlengthy period of her marijuana use, and it is considered insufficient to conclude that the \nreported abstinence will continue. Given Applicant\u2019s cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, \nand regulations, her use of marijuana, despite knowing that such use was prohibited, \ncontinues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 \nF.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving with \nher current employer, initially as a bilingual medical service coordinator since January \n2017, and subsequently as a customer service lead since November 2018.  A 2006 high \nschool graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2015 and 2016. As of her 2019 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that those \nincome tax returns had still not been filed. She offered no claimed change in the status of \nthose federal and state income tax returns by the date the record closed. She also was \nadmittedly a recreational substance abuser. She purchased, possessed and used \nmarijuana, a controlled substance, with varying frequency, over a 13-year period, \nreportedly ending as recently as December 2017. She claimed that she generally used \nmarijuana socially with others. She was arrested on two separate occasions for drug-\nrelated incidents, with the second incident associated with her registering a positive drug-\ntest result during her time in a court-ordered diversion program. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations and drug involvement and substance misuse. See SEAD 4, App. \nA, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust to support a contract with the DOD.

After high school, he \nattended two semesters of college, but did not finish his degree. (GE 1; Tr. 57) \nApplicant married in October 2016, and has a one-year-old daughter. He also has a \nfive-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Applicant has full custody of his five-\nyear-old, and she resides with him. At the time of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife was living \nin a nearby city with their one-year-old daughter. He and his wife had separated, but \nhave reconciled. Applicant\u2019s wife is employed as a receptionist and scheduler for a \nmedical doctor. He plans to move to the city where his wife resides and reunite the \nfamily. (GE 1; Tr. 59-62, 65-66) \n \nOn July 5, 2019, Applicant\u2019s clearance was suspended. He was placed on a \nleave of absence, and administratively debriefed on July 8, 2019. After Applicant was \nplaced on a leave of absence, his Facility Security Officer (FSO) formally requested that \nhe be granted a security clearance waiver and allowed to return to work performing \nduties not requiring a clearance. The chain of command favorably endorsed the FSO\u2019s \nrequest, and on July 24, 2019, the base commander approved her request. Since then, \nApplicant was allowed to return to work performing duties not requiring a clearance. (Tr. \n55-57, 94; AE C, AE D) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe sole SOR allegation under this concern states that Applicant was a member \nof motorcycle club A (Club A) from December 2016 to June 2019. As such, he is alleged \nto have associated with persons involved in criminal activity, including motorcycle club B \n(Club B), a larger motorcycle club considered to be an \u201coutlaw motorcycle gang\u201d (OMG) \nas defined by state law. The Federal Government identified Club A as the official \nsupport club of Club B, and Club A has been defined as a criminal street gang by the \nstate in which they are located. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nIn June 2018, local law enforcement (LE) reported to Applicant\u2019s FSO that he \nwas a member of Club A. LE further reported that Club A was designated as an OMG \nper state statute. LE added that Club A is the only support club of motorcycle Club B, \nand it is their association with Club B that classifies Club A as an OMG. (GE 2; Tr. 77-\n78) Per state statute, members of Club A are designated criminal street gang members. \nUnder state statute, a criminal street gang member is defined as an individual who \nmeets certain criteria that Applicant purportedly met, which include self-proclamation, \nwitness testimony or official statement, paraphernalia or photographs, clothing or colors, \nand any other indicia of street gang membership. (GE 2) At his hearing, Applicant \ndescribed club A\u2019s patch. (Tr. 70-71) \n \nActing on the information she received from local law enforcement, Applicant\u2019s \nFSO interviewed him in June 2018 regarding this matter. Applicant acknowledged being \na member of Club A, but denied engaging in any criminal activity with Club A. The FSO \nadvised Applicant to disassociate himself from Club A, as his continued involvement \nwith Club A may have an adverse effect on his current security eligibility. (GE 2; Tr. 78) \nOn June 29, 2018, the FSO submitted a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) \nreport to the DOD CAF reporting the information above. When the FSO submitted her \nreport, she noted that there were no criminal charges pending against Applicant nor has \nhe been involved in any criminal activity. (GE 2) After his FSO counseled him to \nterminate his affiliation with Club A, he did not do so immediately because he \u201csought \nmore answers.\u201d At the time, he did not see himself as a potential threat to national \nsecurity or unqualified to hold a clearance. (Tr. 64-65, 68-69, 78-81) \n \nApplicant affiliated with Club A because he enjoyed riding motorcycles and \nfraternizing with individuals with the same interests. Applicant and several of his friends \nformed the local chapter of Club A after exploring various options. When Applicant was \nactive with Club A, it had \u201c[a]bout four members.\u201d Originally, there were five members. \nApplicant was not an officer in Club A. When the idea of forming a club was presented \nto Applicant, he saw it as a form of brotherhood that was not to do \u201ccriminal tasks\u201d or \n\u201cbad stuff.\u201d Spouses and children of Club A members were welcome to attend many of \ntheir events such as birthday parties and barbeques. (Tr. 86-93) \n \nApplicant credibly testified that at no time while he was a member of local Club A \ndid it engage in any criminal activity. Nor did anyone in Clubs A or B ever solicit him to \nparticipate in any criminal activity. His primary activity with Club A was riding \nmotorcycles, or what he referred to as \u201cwind or throttle therapy.\u201d At the time he joined \nClub A, he was not aware that they were considered an OMG by law enforcement \nauthorities. He was further unaware that he or Club A would be \u201cguilty by their \nassociation\u201d with Club B. Applicant\u2019s initiation to become a member of Club A consisted \nof associating with fellow members, which earned him his Club A patch. (Tr. 64, 69-73; \nGE 2) There is no record evidence that Applicant or any members of his local Club A \nchapter engaged in any criminal activity. \n \nOn May 14, 2019, as part of his security clearance background investigation, \nApplicant had an Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM \nPSI). (GE 3; Tr. 79) After that interview, Applicant stated that he had a better \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nunderstanding of the Government\u2019s concerns regarding his continued association with \nClub A. It was during his meeting with the investigator that he was informed that Club A \nwas an OMG because they were a support club of Club B. At that point, Applicant \ninformed the investigator that he needed to resign from Club A, and he did so.  (SOR \nAnswer; GE 3; Tr. 64, 70, 75, 78-80) On June 18, 2019, Applicant emailed his FSO and \nadvised her that he had disassociated from Club A. He did this before his clearance was \nsuspended on July 5, 2019. He advised in that email that he no longer had regular \ncontact with members of Clubs A and B. (SOR Answer; Tr. 65, 80; AE A, AE B) \n \nApplicant realizes that he could have avoided his current problems had he \nresigned from Club A when his FSO first raised this issue with him in June 2018. He \nexplained that he did not want to make a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d and base his decision to \nresign from Club A on what appeared to be \u201crumor-like\u201d information. However, after \ntaking into account the information he learned during his OPM PSI, and the adverse \neffect his continued membership in Club A would have on his job, as well as on his \nmarriage and family, he decided it was time to disassociate from Club A. (Tr. 81-86)  \n \nIn the Government\u2019s case in chief, Department Counsel called an intelligence \noperations specialist (IOS) with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). \nShe called IOS as an expert witness on OMGs. IOS submitted an extensive resume and \nelaborated on his background and qualifications. Department Counsel moved to accept \nIOS \u201cas an expert witness in the area of outlaw motorcycle gangs.\u201d Without objection \nfrom Applicant, I accepted IOS as an expert as such. IOS provided extensive testimony \nabout Clubs A and B and motorcycle clubs in general. IOS did not have any knowledge \nof criminal activity of Club A in the state where Applicant lived nor did he have any \nknowledge of Applicant personally being involved in any criminal activity. (GE 10; Tr. \n16-53)  \n \nDepartment Counsel also offered criminal state statute definitions of various \ncriminal activity and secondary source material that provided extensive background \ninformation on OMGs, to include articles authored by subject matter experts on OMGs \nand a 2018 indictment that describes criminal behavior of Clubs A and B members in \nother states. (GE 5 \u2013 GE 9) None of the material referred to Applicant or his local Club \nA chapter. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant \nsubmitted \nfive \ncharacter \nletters: \n(1) \ncoworker/friend; \n(2) \ncoworker/friend; (3) coworker/friend; (4) cousin; and (5) wife. His three coworkers are \nlong-time employees at Applicant\u2019s place of employment and all hold security \nclearances. They spoke highly of his work ethic, dependability, dedication to his family, \nand good character. Applicant\u2019s cousin has known him most of his life, and is a retired \nNaval Intelligence officer familiar with security clearance requirements. All four of these \nindividuals are familiar with Applicant\u2019s situation, assert that he is not a security risk, and \nrecommend that his clearance be reinstated. Lastly, Applicant\u2019s wife wrote a compelling \nletter describing his dedication as a husband and father. She described him as an \n\u201cincredible, loving, patriotic, and loyal man.\u201d (Tr. 94-96; AE F(1) \u2013 AE F(5)) \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct may be a security concern, stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior . . . ; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nApplicant is a motorcycle enthusiast. From December 2016 to June 2019, he was \na member of his local chapter of motorcycle club A in his state of residence. In June \n2018, Applicant\u2019s FSO advised him that his continuing membership in Club A was a \nsecurity concern. Applicant\u2019s membership continued until June 2019, when he resigned \nfrom the group after his OPM background interview. \n \n \nState law enforcement authorities consider Club A to be an OMG due to its \nrelationship with and support of Club B, a larger motorcycle club. Club B is also \nconsidered by State and Federal authorities to be an OMG that engages in criminal \nactivity. Club A is the only support club for Club A and has been defined as a criminal \nstreet gang under state statute. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he joined Club A due to his interests in motorcycles and in \nassociating with those with similar interests. The Club A chapter he joined had only four \nor five members. Applicant was not aware that they engaged in criminal activity. The \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nexpert witness presented by the Government was not aware of Club A\u2019s activities \nlocally, nor was he aware of Applicant\u2019s activities with the club.  \n \n \nNevertheless, the record establishes that Club A is regarded by State and \nFederal law enforcement authorities as an OMG, chiefly through Club A\u2019s status as a \nsupport club for Club B, a larger motorcycle club regarded by law enforcement \nauthorities as an OMG or criminal street gang engaging in criminal activity. AG \u00b6 16(g) \nis therefore applicable. \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he was not aware that Club A was regarded as an \nOMG or one engaged in criminal activity. However, he was also on notice as of June \n2018 that his ongoing membership in Club A was a security concern, yet, at least for the \ntime being, his membership continued. His continuing membership in Club A, once he \nwas so advised by company security personal, was an act of poor judgment. AG \u00b6 16(d) \napplies as does the general concern of AG \u00b6 15. Further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17 lists four potentially mitigating conditions under these facts: \n \n(c) the offense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with person involved in criminal activities was unwilling, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) are fully applicable. Applicant\u2019s explanation \nof how he came to be a member of Club A is credible and accepted. His motivation to \nbe associated with Club A was his affinity for riding motorcycles and fellowship. The \nsize of his local chapter averaged about four members. Typical activities that Applicant\u2019s \nlocal Club A engaged in, in addition to riding motorcycles, were family social events and \nbarbeques.  \n \nThe largest hurdle Applicant had to overcome was his continued association with \nClub A after his FSO counseled him, in June 2018, to disassociate from Club A. \nApplicant stated that he did not appreciate the adverse effects his continued \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nmembership in Club A would have on his clearance and career. He explained that he \nwanted to investigate whether his continued association with Club A was as bad as \nsuggested. It was not until his May 14, 2019 OPM PSI, and his discussion with the \ninvestigator, that he came to the full realization that his association with Club A could \ncost him his clearance and his job. During his interview, the investigator informed him \nthat Club A was an OMG because they were a support group of Club B. At that point, \nApplicant informed the investigator that he needed to resign from Club A and did so on \nJune 18, 2019. \n \nThere is record evidence that Clubs A and B have participated in criminal activity \nin other states. However, there is no evidence that Applicant or any members of his \nlocal Club A chapter engaged in any such activity. That said, there is enough evidence \nto suggest that membership in Club A, being the official support group of Club B, is a \nsecurity concern for Applicant since he was a member. \n \nAs he acknowledged, Applicant, could in all likelihood, have avoided his current \nsituation had he disassociated from Club A when his FSO first brought this matter to his \nattention in June 2018. Although it took him some time before he resigned in June 2019, \nhe did so after it became clearer to him that his continued involvement with Club could \nhave an adverse effect on his security eligibility. Convinced that would be the case after \nhis OPM PSI, he resigned from Club A shortly thereafter to avoid being compromised.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis section under \nGuideline E is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments \nare warranted. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old artillery gunner employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2009. He successfully held a secret clearance for ten years and \nestablished a record of accomplishment as a valued and trusted employee. It is quite \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nnoteworthy that, after his clearance was suspended on July 5, 2019, and he was placed \non a leave of absence and administratively debriefed on July 8, 2019, his FSO \nrequested that he be granted a security clearance waiver and allowed to return to work \nperforming duties not requiring a clearance. Applicant\u2019s chain of command favorably \nendorsed the FSO\u2019s request, and on July 24, 2019, the base commander approved her \nrequest and Applicant returned to work performing duties not requiring a clearance.  \n \nIt is also noteworthy that there is no evidence that Applicant engaged in or was \ncharged with any criminal activity while a member of Club A. Cumulatively, Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter letters strongly support reinstatement of his clearance and deserve \nconsiderable weight. These individuals know Applicant well and are familiar with his \nwork ethic and character. His wife provided a heartfelt account of his good character \nand devotion to his family. Applicant was open and forthright during his hearing and \nrecognized, albeit after some time, that his continued association with Club A could \nadversely affect his career and family. He made the wise choice to disassociate from \nClub A on June 18, 2019, shortly after his May 14, 2019 OPM PSI.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.a: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant pays \nhis former spouse $268 monthly for child support. (Tr. 25, 57-58; GE 1; AE 8, AE 13) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s responsibility for the 14 delinquent SOR debts, totaling $23,987, is \nestablished in part by his SOR Answer; his May 2018, May 2019, and October 2019 \ncredit reports; his December 11, 2018 Office of Personnel Management Personal \nSubject Interview (OPM PSI); and his hearing testimony. At the hearing, it was \ndetermined that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e were duplicate debts. (SOR \nAnswer; Tr. 71-77; GE 2 \u2013 5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems originated when he was married to his former \nspouse. At that time, he was employed as a railroad conductor, owned a home, had two \npaid-off automobiles, and had good credit. In 2007, at age 40, he had a heart attack. He \ntestified that his former spouse \u201cactually started to max out everything (credit cards) like \nas if she was leaving. . . [s]o shortly after, she filed for divorce and basically took most \nof the house.\u201d (Tr. 26-27, 28)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and ongoing relationship with his former spouse have been \nvery contentious. (Tr. 24; AE 4) The divorce decree required, among other things, that \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant\u2019s spouse pay him $4,590 at a rate of at least $50 per month with interest \naccruing at the statutory rate until paid in full, to reimburse him for the SOR \u00b6 1.a. debt, \ndiscussed below. Applicant\u2019s spouse was also required to pay him $945 as replacement \ncost of items of clothing she wrongfully sold, destroyed, or disposed of, as well as \nseveral other debts the court determined she was responsible for during their marriage. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse refused to honor her court-ordered debt payments, leaving Applicant \nresponsible. (SOR Answer; Tr. 31-32, 51; AE 1)  \n \n \nAfter the divorce, Applicant had visitation rights to see his daughter every week. \nIn March 2018, the local family law court allowed Applicant\u2019s former spouse and \ndaughter to relocate to another city within the state. The modified court order reduced \nApplicant\u2019s visitation rights to seeing his daughter every other weekend. He also \nincurred visitation travel costs and the court increased his monthly child support \npayments because his spouse moved to a higher cost area. (Tr. 54-55, 58, 60; AE 5, \nAE 10, AE 13) \n \n \nIn February 2013, Applicant was rear-ended, with his daughter in the car, in an \nautomobile accident that caused him to be out of work for approximately five months. \nBetween 2013 and 2017, Applicant was in and out of the hospital for surgeries and \nother ailments such as valley fever and thoracic outlet syndrome, causing him to play \ncatch up with bills and child support. At times, he was able to receive short-term \ndisability (STD) funds. (SOR Answer; Tr. 27-29, 32, 39-40, 61, 66-67; AE 2, AE 16, AE \n26)  \n \n \nHowever, if his savings and the money he received from STD did not cover \nmedical bills or child support, he would borrow money from his parents, to stay current. \nMoreover, on the rare occasion he had a child support arrearage, the arrearage was \nautomatically taken out of the following year\u2019s income tax refund. Applicant has always \nmade paying child support a priority and is current on his child support obligations. \n(SOR Answer; Tr. 55-57, 67; GE 2; AE 7, AE 27) \n \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s own medical problems, his daughter was diagnosed \nwith scoliosis in 2018. Per his divorce decree, he pays for his daughter\u2019s medical \ninsurance and 55% of her uncovered medical bills. Applicant believes some of the \nmedical bills discussed below pertain to his daughter. His former spouse does not \ninform him of their daughter\u2019s medical bills when they are incurred, and he typically is \nnot aware of them until they are delinquent. Because of these various medical issues, \n\u201c[a]ll the medical bills started racking up.\u201d Applicant summed up his position, \u201cI was \noverwhelmed by . . . medical bills.\u201d In addition, as recently as November 2019, Applicant \nhit a tire while driving on the freeway that damaged his automobile and caused him to \nsustain soft tissue damage. This accident caused Applicant to lose two weeks of work \nand he was required to pay for uncovered automobile repairs and medical treatment. \n(Tr. 29-31, 34, 51-55, 58-60, 62-65, 71-77; AE 1, AE 2, AE 3, AE 6, AE 11, AE 19 \u2013 AE \n22) \n  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nThe following is a summary of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts and their status: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - $11,323 charged-off credit card debt. Applicant\u2019s former spouse \nincurred this debt while she was married to Applicant before filing for divorce. Applicant \nsettled this account for $3,397 and paid the amount in full on December 27, 2019. As \nnoted, his former spouse was required to reimburse him $4,590 for her portion of this \ndebt plus interest. To enforce this debt and the $945 discussed above, Applicant was \nrequired to file two post-decree judgment requests after his divorce was final. Applicant \nwas ultimately successful in collecting $2,090 from his former spouse that he received \nin three separate payments in January and February 2020. (SOR Answer; Tr. 34-38, \n61-62, 65; AE 14, AE 15, AE 18, AE 23, AE 24) DEBT RESOLVED. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.n. The remaining 13 SOR debts are all delinquent medical \naccounts: 1.b - $956; 1.c - $930; 1.d - $704; 1.e - $704 (duplicate of 1.d); 1.f - $613; 1.g \n- $483; 1.h - $437; 1.i - $362; 1.j - $323; 1.k - $234; 1.l - $50; 1.m \u2013 $1,302; and 1.n - \n$5,566 (settled for $2,784 and paid in full). Post-hearing, Applicant provided \ndocumentation showing that he has made payment arrangements to resolve all of these \ndebts, with the exception of 1.n, which is settled and paid in full. (Tr. 38-51; 68-72, AE \n28, AE 30) DEBTS BEING RESOLVED EXCEPT FOR SOR \u00b6 1.N WHICH IS \nRESOLVED.  \n \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant consulted a financial counselor, who provided him with a \nstrategy on how to pay off or pay down his delinquent medical accounts. Applicant \nfollowed the counselor\u2019s advice and, as demonstrated by his post-hearing evidence, he \nis on a path to regain financial responsibility. (Tr. 67, 78-79, 80-83; AE 28) Applicant \nalso submitted a budget that reflects a gross monthly income of $2,217, with a net \nmonthly remainder of $418. His budget further reflects that he maintains a modest \nlifestyle and lives within his means. Applicant is current on his mortgage and other \ndebts. (Tr. 66-68, 79-80; AE 25, AE 29)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character letters, one from his supervisor and the \nsecond from a coworker. His supervisor described him as a model employee, \nhardworking, sincere, and reliable. Applicant\u2019s supervisor has known him for a lengthy \nperiod and is familiar with his clearance financial issues. Applicant\u2019s coworker described \nhim as the first to offer assistance, responsible, and considerate. Both individuals \nrecommend and support continuation of Applicant\u2019s clearance. (Tr. 61-62; AE 17) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe evidence of record establishes concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nFurther review is necessary. \n \n AG \u00b6 20 lists five potential mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant had a series of \nunexpected medical emergencies and automobile accidents. In 2007, he had a heart \nattack; in 2013, he was rear-ended with his daughter in the car; between 2013 and \n2017, he was in and out of the hospital for various surgeries and other ailments such as \nvalley fever and thoracic outlet syndrome; and in November 2018, he was involved in an \nautomobile accident. He lost wages because of missed work after these accidents, \nsurgeries, and hospitalizations for varying periods.  \n \nIn 2010, Applicant went through a contentious divorce. The fallout from that \ndivorce continues to this day. After his 2007 heart attack, his spouse ran up their joint \ncredit cards before leaving. Although Applicant\u2019s divorce decree ordered his former \nspouse to pay him $4,590 as her portion of marital credit card debt, and $945 as \nreimbursement for his clothing she destroyed, he was only recently able to recover \n$2,090 after filing two post-divorce petitions to enforce judgment. In 2018, Applicant\u2019s \nformer spouse, along with their daughter, moved to a high cost area within the state that \nresulted in less visitation, unplanned visitation costs, and increased child support. \nApplicant is also responsible for paying for his daughter\u2019s medical insurance and 55% of \nher uncovered medical bills. As noted, Applicant\u2019s former spouse does not apprise him \nof their daughter\u2019s medical bills as they are incurred and he typically does not receive \nthem until they are delinquent. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant settled and paid his two largest debts, and made payment \narrangements for the remaining medical debts. Applicant sought financial counseling \nlate in this process. His explanation, of being overwhelmed, for delaying financial \ncounseling is understandable given the ongoing conditions beyond his control. Applicant \nhas embraced the advice received through financial counseling. He has contacted all of \nhis creditors, settled or set up payment plans, made payments, and is on track to regain \nfinancial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(e) is partially applicable for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e, \nbecause they are duplicate allegations of the same debt. \n \nAs noted, Applicant settled and paid his two largest SOR debts. He has made \npayment arrangements with his creditors for the remaining SOR medical debts. \nApplicant has made significant or sufficient progress towards regaining financial \nresponsibility in a deliberate and measured way. With this in mind, the adjudicative \nguidelines do not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Appeal Board has \nestablished the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as this: \n \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd.

When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view \nApplicant\u2019s corrective action to be responsible and reasonable. Of almost $24,000 in \nSOR-alleged delinquent debt, less than $6,400 remains unresolved. Given his \nresources, he has initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of those remaining \nmedical debts and is making a good-faith effort to resolve them.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant\u2019s years of employment as a defense contractor \nwhile successfully holding a clearance weigh in his favor. He is a law-abiding citizen and \na productive member of society. He is current on his day-to-day expenses, lives within \nhis means, and his SOR debts were resolved or are being resolved. He has provided \nevidence of being a productive, loyal, and responsible employee. He is a devoted father \nand places a high priority on ensuring his child support payments are current and that \nhe provides for his daughter to the best of his ability. Applicant understands what he \nneeds to do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts at debt \nresolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayment.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. National security eligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), implemented in June 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested an \nadministrative \ndetermination. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) \ndated October 2, 2019.1 Applicant received the FORM on October 8, 2019. He \nsubmitted an additional response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 13, 2019. Based on a review of the case file, submissions, and exhibits, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n1The Government submitted four items for the record. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the only allegation in the SOR did \nnot apply. However, he acknowledged that he did not file his income tax returns within \none year of the required legal time frame. However, he stated that he filed for \nextensions. (Item 2) \nApplicant is 59 years old. He obtained his undergraduate degree in May 1983. \nHe is divorced, but he remarried in 1994. He has four children. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 1995. He reports no military service. Applicant has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2010, but he has been in the contracting field since at least \n2013. He completed his security clearance application (SCA) in 2018. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has failed to file his Federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Item 1) There is nothing in the record to establish \nrequests for any tax extensions. \nApplicant provided a letter dated June 6, 2019, that explains when he received \nthe SOR, he was in the middle of completing his taxes. He elaborated that he files \njointly and he has a small business. (Attached to answer in file) He admitted that he \nwas late after filing for extensions. He submitted receipts for other unalleged accounts \nthat have been paid in full. (Item 4) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he has provided proof of income \nand proof that he filed his income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. He noted that \nhe was not a good bookkeeper and that he started a business in 2013 after being laid \noff. He noted that his bookkeeping skills are improving. (Response to FORM) \nApplicant submitted copies of federal and state income tax returns for the \nfollowing years: 2016, 2017, and 2018. He owes $45,580 for tax for the year 2016. The \ndocument submitted stated that the payment is scheduled. (Item 5) It appears that the \npayment was made under the schedule. He provided documentation on the status of \nthe tax has been paid. For other years, Applicant was owed an overpayment. \n(Response to FORM) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nThe U.S. Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d2  The burden of proof is something less than a \npreponderance of evidence.3 The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.4  \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d 5  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 6  Any reasonable doubt\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be \nresolved in favor of protecting such information. 7  The decision to deny an individual a \nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is \nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President \nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance. \n      2 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      3 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      4 ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concerns such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nThe Government provided credible evidence that Applicant did not timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, Financial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. With such \nconditions raised, it is left to Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant provided insufficient \ninformation that would allow this MC. There is no sufficient explanation from Applicant \nconcerning the payment process. None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply in \nthis case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the \nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the whole-person factors. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He has worked for his current employer since 2017, but \npossessed a security clearance and has been in the contracting field since about 2010. \nHe did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate not filing his federal and state income \ntax returns in a timely manner. He submitted records that he filed in 2019. He paid his \nfederal income tax at that time, but his delay does not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concern. He filed his state income tax returns in 2019 and was \ngiven overpayments. (Response to FORM)  \nHe has not met his burden of proof in this case. I have doubts about his \njudgment and reliability. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden in this case. He did not mitigate the security \nconcerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F : \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nClearance is denied. \nNOREEN A.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 5, 2019; attaching thereto \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A~D, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November 8, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 19, \n2019, scheduling the hearing for January 6, 2020. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2, which were admitted without \nobjection, and Hearing Exhibit (HX) I for Administrative Notice. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf. Applicant offered 16 documents, which I marked as AppXs D through T. \n\n \n2 \n \nAppXs A~T were admitted into evidence.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on January \n14, 2020. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Taiwan. Department Counsel provided a five-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by 11 sets of Government documents pertaining to Taiwan, identified \nas HE I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports.

He contacts his father about \n\u201conce every year.\u201d (TR at page 29 lines 7~18.) \n \n \n1.b.  Applicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens and residents of Taiwan. (TR at page 30 \nline 22 to page 34 line 6.) His oldest sister has mental health issues, and his youngest \nsister is a veterinarian. (Id, and at page 71 lines 15~17.) Applicant has little contact with \n\n \n3 \n \nhis oldest sister, and only about four times a year with his youngest sister. (TR at page \n30 line 22 to page 34 line 6.) Neither sister has any connection with the Taiwanese \ngovernment. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nTaiwan. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 36 line 3.) His mother-in-law is \u201ca cook,\u201d and his \nfather-in-law is \u201cretired.\u201d (TR at page 71 lines 18~25.) Through his wife, Applicant has \ncontact with these in-laws about four times a year. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 36 \nline 3.) \n \n \n1.d.   Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is citizens and resident of Taiwan. (TR at page 37 \nline 7 to page 39 line 8.) She is a \u201cfull-time mother,\u201d and their contact is limited to about \ntwice a year. (Id, and TR at page 72 at lines 1~3.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant maintains contact, about once or twice a year, with friends who are \ncitizens of Taiwan, but for the most part reside in the United States. (TR at page 37 line \n7 to page 39 line 8.)  None are affiliated with the Taiwanese government, and he met \nthem through his university schooling in the United States. (Id.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant denies that he owns any real property in Taiwan. He transferred \nownership to his wife, who is in the process of selling said property. (TR at page 39 line \n9 to page 43 line 13, at page 54 lines 7~16, and AppX A and B.) Furthermore, they are \nin the process of purchasing real property in the United States, as evidenced by \ndocumentation. (AppXs V and W.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant denies that he has two bank accounts in Taiwan, valued at about \n$50,000. He has transferred said funds to the United States, as evidenced by \ndocumentation to that end. (TR at page 43 line 14 to page 45 line 21, and AppXs C, D, \nE~I.)   \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice as to certain facts regarding Taiwan: The United \nStates recognizes Taiwan as part of the Peoples Republic of China. It perpetrates \neconomic espionage.  \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \n\n \n5 \n \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest;  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents, siblings and in-laws are citizens and residents of Taiwan. He \nalso had a significant property interest and bank accounts in Taiwan. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his Taiwanese relatives is infrequent at best. None have \nany connection with the Taiwanese government. For the most part, his Taiwanese \nfriends live in the United States, and he has little contact with them. Furthermore, his \nformer Taiwanese real-estate interests have been transferred to his wife, who is in the \nprocess of selling said property. They are also in the process of purchasing real-estate \nin the United States. The monies from his Taiwanese bank accounts have been \ntransferred to the United States. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is \nwell respected, as evidenced by letters of support. (AppX J.) Furthermore, he performs \nwell at his job. (AppX O and Q.) Applicant\u2019s wife and native-born American child live in \nthe United States, and he is in the process of purchasing real estate here. He can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States due to his ties \nhere.  \n\n \n7 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility to \ncontinue working in a public trust position is denied.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 27, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a position of trust. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nOn August 27, 2019 Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of them, \nand requesting a decision based on the administrative record instead of a hearing. On \nSeptember 19, 2019, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). \n\n2 \n \nApplicant received the FORM on September 23, 2019 and was instructed to file any \nobjections to this information, or supply additional information within 30 days. Applicant did \nnot respond. The case was assigned to me on November 22, 2019.  \n \nRuling of Evidence \n \n \nItem 4 is an Office of Personnel Management record of Applicant\u2019s personal subject \ninterview. Absent an applicant\u2019s consent, such documents are typically inadmissible. \n(Directive, E. 3.1.20) However, in ISCR Case No. 16-03126, decided on January 24, 2018, \nthe Appeal Board held that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and \nconsider a summary of personal subject interview where the applicant was placed on \nnotice of her opportunity to object to consideration of the summary, the applicant filed no \nobjection to it, and there was no indication that the summary contained inaccurate \ninformation. In this case Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of her \nopportunity to submit objections or material that she wanted the administrative judge to \nconsider. (FORM at 2) She filed no objection. Consequently, I have incorporated Item 4 \ninto the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 35-year-old married woman with one child, age 14. A previous \nmarriage ended in divorce in 2018. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in April 2012, and is \ncurrently working as a customer service team lead. (Item 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,330. Applicant \nadmits all of the allegations, contending that she first fell behind on her debts in 2013 after \nshe financed the purchase of a car with a high interest rate loan. (Item 4 at 54) The \nmonthly loan payments proved to be higher than anticipated. Shortly after purchasing the \ncar, Applicant\u2019s son required unexpected medical treatment, which generated more \nexpenses. Consequently, she began falling behind on her debts. By June 2019, she had \nincurred 17 debts, totaling $29,330. (Item 2) She asserts that she is making monthly \npayments towards the satisfaction of subparagraphs 1.c, 1.h, 1.k through 1.o, and 1.q. She \nprovided no evidence supporting her assertion, nor did she did elaborate on the current \nstatus of the remaining SOR debts.   \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 \n18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies trigger the application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n4 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe untimely illness of Applicant\u2019s son, which occurred shortly after she admittedly \noverextended herself with the purchase of a car through a high interest rate loan, certainly \nconstitutes a misfortune that was beyond her control. Conversely, Applicant produced \nscant evidence of her son\u2019s medical problems or the related expenses, nor any evidence \nsupporting her contention that she is paying most of the SOR debts through payment plans \nor otherwise has them under control. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating \nconditions applies, and Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcern.   \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nA comprehensive whole-person evaluation is predicated upon having adequate \nevidence to conduct such a determination. Applicant provided no evidence to corroborate \nher contention that she is paying her debts, nor did she elaborate on any of the \ncircumstances surrounding the incurrence of her delinquent debt. Under these \ncircumstances, consideration of the whole-person concept does not change my opinion. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nposition of trust. Eligibility for a position of trust is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He seeks to obtain a security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 19 delinquent debts in the amount of $28,000 \nincluding an additional $31,000, which is attributable to student loan providers and several \nprivate creditors. (Item 1) Applicant denies all of the alleged delinquent debts (SOR \nparagraphs 1. a through s). He denied the allegations but acknowledges the debts and \nexplains and provides information showing what he has done to resolve the delinquent \ndebts. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant attributes the delinquent debts to his separation from his wife in 2012, \nseveral periods of unemployment, including most recently from November 2017 through \nJune 2018. (Item 4) Applicant became ill with a viral infection and was unemployed \nbetween October 2013 and February 2014. As a result of the unemployment, he moved \nhome to live with his parents. He was unable to work, go to school, or live on his own due \nto the infection. (Item 4) He fell behind and was not able to pay his creditors and several \naccounts were charged off or placed for collection. In addition, he had a vehicle \nrepossessed. For SOR 1.a, he states that the collection account from 2013, in the amount \nof $655, was the result of over-withdrawing funds from his bank account during a time he \nwas coping with medical issues. (Item 4) Applicant provided confirmation that he paid the \ndelinquent debt in May 2019. (Items 3, 7) \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, Applicant states that he has paid the $428 medical account that \nbecame delinquent in 2013, and the record corroborates that Applicant paid the debt in \nMay 2019. (Item 3, 7) \n \nAs to the 2012, delinquent account for $123 in SOR 1.c, Applicant acknowledged \nthat this was the result of changing cell phone carriers. He claims that he paid the bill in \nfull, when he became aware of it, during his security clearance process. He further \nclaimed that he paid the bill in May 2019. The record as it stands does not contain any \nevidence supporting payment.  \n \nAs to SOR accounts, SOR 1.d for $1,162, Applicant stated that the student loan \ncompany and the student loan is in deferment until 2024. As for 1.e, for $1,756 this is the \nsame student loan company and is also deferred until 2024. He provided a printout from \nNavient detailing a deferred account until 2024. \n \nAs to SOR 1.f, a mobile account in the amount of $631, this was the result of his \nillness in 2013 and the account was paid in May 2019. (Item 3)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAs to the debt in SOR 1.g, Applicant stated that his cell phone was stolen in 2015, \nand he paid the account in May 2019, providing documentation. (Item 3) \n \nThe SOR debt in 1.h, a medical account in the amount of $950, according to \nApplicant is on a payment plan of about $200 monthly. He presented a receipt of $200, \ndated August 2019, but it is not clear from the record if this pertains to the account. \n \nAs to SOR 1.i, another medical account in the amount of $1,762, Applicant claims \na payment plan of about $200 monthly. The receipt from August 2019 was presented as \nconfirmation. It is not clear from the record if this is the same medical account as SOR \n1.h. \n \nAs to SOR 1. j, a vehicle loan in the amount of $4,446 from 2013, when Applicant \nbecame very sick, and could not work, and he fell behind in his payments. Applicant \nprovided documentation that he paid the delinquent balance in full on June 12, 2019. \n(Item 3) \n \nAs to SORs 1.k-1.q, a series of seven government student loans, for an \napproximate total of $31,000, Applicant provided information that the loans were in good \nstanding as of April 2019. The documentation that was submitted from federal loan \nservicing reflects that seven student loan accounts are deferred through December 8, \n2023. The most recent credit report confirms a deferment until October 2019. (Item 7) \n \nAs to SOR 1.r, a collection account in the amount of $10,900, for an automobile \nloan that he could not make payments when unemployed. He was on a $200 a month \npayment plan. However, he did not provide recent information of the existence of a \npayment plan. Applicant is attempting to negotiate a lower payment on the debt and has \nrequested documentation from the creditor. (Item 3) \n \nAs to SOR 1.s, a medical collection account in the amount of $458 for radiology \nservices, Applicant believed it would be covered by a low-income-based assistance \nprogram based on information given to him. He paid the debt in December 2018 and the \nrecord confirms his payment. (Item 6) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated December 20, 2018, and in his \nanswer (Item 3) he detailed his difficulties that were beyond his control and problem with \nobtaining decent paying full-time jobs. He reached out to his creditors and did not ignore \nhis financial situation. When he was laid off in mid-2015, he did not find work until the end \nof 2016. He completed an updated-financial budget which shows what he has paid to his \ndelinquent creditors. He earns about $55,000 a year. Applicant has a savings account. \nHe has allotted money for delinquent debts each month. (Item 3) \n \nHe took measures in 2013 to move in with his parents to save money. He has \nstudied so that he could improve his chances of steady employment. He began paying \ndebts in 2017 and 2018. His current job has allowed him to repay his debts. He entered \ninto a student loan rehabilitation program. In 2018, he sought financial counseling from \nvarious groups but the fees were quite steep. (Item 3) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgements, corroborated by his credit reports establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \n\n \n6 \n \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are the result of a multitude of circumstances beyond \nhis control that began occurring in 2013. He and his wife separated; he lost several jobs; \nhe had several serious medical injuries and infections that did not permit him to work or \ncontinue with his school. He took reasonable actions under the circumstances and moved \nin with his parents. His medical bills and other bills increased. He was unemployed for \nseveral long periods of time as recent as June 2018. He continued to act responsibly and \nfind low paying jobs. He did not ignore his creditors. He is using sound judgment and \npaying his debts. Granted, he has not paid all of them, but he is not required to do so all \nat once. He has established a track record of payment history.  \n \nApplicant presented recent information about his payment history to the various \naccounts that have been paid, and his student loans in rehabilitation. He started several \npayment plans. He has a new full-time well-paying job. He developed an updated budget \nand is dedicated to paying his bills. AG \u00b6 20(a), is applicable in this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. He had several circumstances beyond his control of \nvarying degrees occurring almost simultaneously. He painstakingly listed all information \non his security clearance application and provided documentation to show exactly what \nhe has paid and what his plans are. He rehabilitated his student loans. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. He sought financial counseling with a number \nof groups and listened to what they had to say, but the fees were too steep and the plans \nwere seven years long. He devised his own plan.  AG 20(d) is established. Applicant is \nadhering to good-faith efforts now to address his financial accounts. He produced \nsufficient documentation to fully support this mitigating condition. Applicant has met his \nburden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n7 \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his many challenging conditions beyond his control in recent \nyears, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \nindebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-s: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Clark, Esq.  \n05/04/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose largely after his marriage ended and he experienced low \nincome during periods of employment instability. His debts are now largely resolved and \nare under control. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate financial security \nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 9, 2017. \nOn July 31, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, due to his delinquent debts. The DOD CAF issued \nthe SOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines, (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 30, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on December 11, 2019. On January 16, 2020, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for February 6, 2020.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough R. He submitted AE A through AE D with his Answer. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant and one other witness testified. I held the record open to allow \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation. His post-hearing \ndocuments were marked as AE S through AE Y and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing on February 19, 2020. The record closed on \nFebruary 20, 2020.  \n \nClerical Amendment to the Statement of Reasons \n \n \nWhile drafting this decision, I noticed that the case number in the SOR and the \nAnswer (ISCR Case No. 19-01775) is incorrect. This is likely due to a drafting error. The \nhearing notice and the transcript reflect the correct case number, ISCR Case No. 19-\n01955, as does the rest of the case file. Sua sponte, I amended the caption of the SOR \nto reflect the correct case number. It is also reflected in the caption of this decision, above.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, all with \nexplanations. I incorporate his admissions and explanations into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He has been married twice. He was married for less than \na year in 2008-2009. He remarried in 2012, but he and his second wife soon separated. \nTheir divorce became final in January 2015. He has no children. (Tr. 42-43, 80-82, 84-\n86; GE 1; AE C; AE K) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2006. He spent about 20 months in the \nArmy (2008-2009) before he was honorably discharged after a service-related injury, with \n60% disability. (Tr. 30, 49-50, 82-83; AE P) Between 2009 and 2012, he held several jobs \nas a security officer. (Tr. 36; AE D, AE Q)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was working long hours, with low pay. (Tr. 30-32) This \nled him to decide to earn his commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL), which he hoped would \nlead to better income. He financed his training himself. (Tr. 50; AE D, AE Q) \n \nApplicant was an independent truck driver for about two years, from 2012 to 2014. \nHis truck broke down several times, which led to increased expenses and lower income. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAt one point, he was stranded in a city far from his home state for several months. He left \nthat position in December 2013. He was terminated from his next trucking job, per \ncompany policy, after he was in an accident in the middle of the night, in September 2014. \n(GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 53-55, 78-79) Applicant was not making much income, and his truck \ndriving job took him far from home. The marriage quickly foundered and Applicant fell \nbehind on his debts. After their marriage failed, they sold the home. (Tr. 31-32, 35-36)  \n \nApplicant then worked as a technician for a telecom company from October 2014 \nto August 2015. From fall 2015 to spring 2017, he returned to school, earning associate\u2019s \ndegrees in cyber security. (AE D, AE Q) He was then unemployed from May to November \n2017. He submitted his SCA in November 2017 for his current clearance sponsor. He has \nworked on unclassified assignments but his full employment has been \u201con hold\u201d pending \nresolution of his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 68-69; GE 1 at 14) Since then he held several \njobs in the defense industry, in his field of cyber security. (AE V, AE W, Tr. 102-110) In \nthe meantime, he is doing contract work as a satellite technician. (Tr. 94-95) \n \nApplicant earned very little income in 2014 and 2015. His tax returns reflect \nadjusted gross income of less than $10,000 each year. (AE S, AE T, AE U) From 2015 to \n2017 he was in school, not making much money. (Tr. 98-99) Since then, his income has \nimproved. A 2018 tax return shows income of about $34,000. (AE V) He had multiple \nemployers in 2019, both in the defense industry and with the satellite company. His W-2 \nforms show a combined income of about $42,400. (AE W)  \n \n \nThe six debts alleged in the SOR total $18,585. They are established by credit \nreports from January 2018 and April 2019. (GE 2, GE 3) Applicant disclosed two past-\ndue debts on his SCA. (GE 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($6,235) and 1.b ($5,125) are charged-off debts to a credit union. After \nthey married in 2012, Applicant and his second wife moved into a new home. These \naccounts were for furniture and home improvements. Applicant fell behind on these and \nother accounts because his priority was to save the home from foreclosure. (Answer; Tr. \n31-32, 48-49, 53-56, 86) The debts have now been settled and paid. (AE G, AE H, AE I)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,459) is a charged-off debt to a different credit union. The debt \nconcerns a car Applicant purchased for his wife in 2012, so she could get to work. She \nassumed responsibility for this debt, but did not make payments after they separated. (AE \nJ) She was also responsible for the debt in their divorce stipulation. (Answer; AE C) She \nstopped making payments on the car after it was totaled. (Tr. 37-40, 43, 86-87; Answer) \nApplicant is considering pursuing his former wife in court to get her to pay the account, \nas agreed. (AE M) However, Applicant admits the debt and has assumed responsibility \nto pay it. (Tr. 32-33, 43-45, 51, 57-59, 86-88; AE N, AE O) He has arranged a $300 a \nmonth payment plan with the creditor. As a result, a garnishment of his wages by the \ncreditor has been released. (AE Y) The debt is being resolved.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,016) relates to a home alarm system Applicant and his second wife \ninstalled at their home. (Answer) Documentation from the creditor shows they are no \nlonger collecting on the account. (Tr. 33, 46-48, 60-63, 88-89; AE E; AE L) It is resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($526) is a debt placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denied the \ndebt, asserting that it is being paid. (Answer) He submitted post-hearing documentation \nthat the account was satisfied in December 2018. (AE X; Tr. 34, 63-66, 89)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($224) is a debt placed for collection by a cable company. Applicant \nbelieves the debt belongs to a former tenant. (Answer) He believes it is no longer listed \non his credit reports. He was unable to provide documentation of its resolution. (Tr. 34, \n66-68, 89-91) \n \n \nApplicant retained a credit counselor in November 2019. His budget indicated \n$4,500 in income from his job, and $1,100 a month in disability pay. (AE F) He lives with \nhis grandmother and pays $250 in rent, and $460 in utilities. (Tr. 74-77; AE F) He has a \n$619 monthly truck payment and a $360 motorcycle payment. His budget shows a \nmonthly surplus of almost $3,000. (AE F; Tr. 45-46, 51, 83-84) \n \n \nA co-worker and personal friend testified for Applicant. He testified that he and \nApplicant met in 2017 while taking a course together. They worked together at a computer \n\u201chelp desk\u201d at a prior employer for about six to eight months, in 2018 and 2019. The \nwitness was Applicant\u2019s supervisor, and has a clearance. Applicant was conscientious \nand a hard worker. He is also smart. The witness attested to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. (Tr. 102-110) \n \nPolicies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could rise security concerns. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfinancial obligations\u201d are applicable, given the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debts.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n  \nThe debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are settled and resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.d is resolved, \nand SOR \u00b6 1.e is paid. Applicant is paying on SOR \u00b6 1.c, even though his wife is \nresponsible for it, Only SOR \u00b6 1.f, a small past-due cable bill, remains unaddressed. The \nfact that at least some of Applicant\u2019s debts remain precludes full application of AG \u00b6 20(a), \nsince some of the debts are ongoing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts occurred due to several circumstances, but chiefly, they resulted \nduring a period of personal and financial instability. He was not earning a good living as \na security officer, so he began a second career as a truck driver. That job came with \nunexpected expenses that impacted his income. It also put a strain on his marriage, as \nhe was often far from home. While he was able to keep his home from foreclosure, he fell \nbehind on other debts. Most of the SOR debts were incurred during this period, and are \ndue to conditions beyond his control. He gave up the trucking job and returned to school, \nearning associate\u2019s degrees in cyber security. His income has increased in recent years, \nand he has paid or is paying most of the debts in the SOR. He has undertaken reasonable, \ngood-faith efforts to resolve his delinquencies, and his finances are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are now largely resolved. They were incurred during a period of \ncareer instability and marital difficulty. His finances are now more stable. I believe he will \nuse the hearing as a learning experience to avoid similar financial issues in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. Applicant responded to the SOR on August 12, \n2019, and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November \n4, 2019, Applicant changed her request to a hearing before an administrative judge. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on January 8, 2010. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough G, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the date in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a from \u201cMarch 2017\u201d to \u201cAugust 2018.\u201d The motion was granted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old executive of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer or a predecessor company since 1985. She is applying for a \nsecurity clearance for the first time. She earned a General Educational Development \n(GED) high school equivalency degree in 1984. She earned associate, bachelor\u2019s, and \nmaster\u2019s degrees in 2002, 2004, and 2008. She is married with two adult children and \ntwo grandchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18, 28-31, 34, 44; GE 1) \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana when she was a teenager and young adult. In 1983, \nwhen she was 15 years old, she was arrested and charged with possession of drug \nparaphernalia. The charge was dismissed. She used cocaine on about two or three \noccasions in 1985 or 1986. She did not particularly care for it, and never used it again. \n(Tr. at 36-38, 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A) \n \nApplicant did not use any illegal drugs between about 1986 and 2015. In about \n2015, she resumed smoking marijuana on an irregular basis after it was offered to her \nby a friend. Applicant does not live in a state that has legalized possession of marijuana. \nShe used it a \u201chandful\u201d of times with her friend who provided the marijuana. Her \ncompany has a policy against using illegal drugs or being under the influence during \nworking hours, but it does not have a policy against all drug use. (Tr. at 38-39, 40-44; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, F) \n \nApplicant reported all her illegal drug use on the Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) she submitted in August 2017. She noted that she intended \nto use marijuana in the future with the following caveat: \u201cOn special occasion only \u2013 \nunless the security clearance prohibits it then I won\u2019t.\u201d  \n \nDuring her background interview in September 2018, she discussed her drug use \nand admitted that she smoked marijuana in August 2018. She indicated that she did not \nthink that marijuana use was a \u201cbig deal.\u201d She explained that marijuana use was legal in \nmany states and that there was less of a stigma attached to using marijuana. She \nindicated that she intended to continue to smoke marijuana, but that she would be \nwilling to stop if required by her employer. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 1, 2) \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant realized after the interview that her answers were worrisome to the \ninvestigator. She indicated in her response to the SOR that \u201cself-reflection made [her] \nrealize that this very rare occasion of self-gratification is not worth losing [her] job or \nbeing viewed as someone that can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d She has not used any illegal drug since \nbefore her interview. She wrote that receiving the SOR \u201cwas both embarrassing and \nhumbling\u201d:  \n \nI will never regret my being honest during this process; it is one-hundred \npercent who I am as a person. I do, however, regret that the choices I \nhave made as an adult have put me in this embarrassing situation in \nasking for a second chance. \n \nApplicant credibly testified that she did not intend to use marijuana or any other \nillegal drug in the future. She still sees the friend she smoked marijuana with, but \nApplicant told her that she no longer uses marijuana. She does not know if the friend \nstill smokes marijuana, as the friend does not do so in her presence. Applicant \ncompleted a 16-hour drug and alcohol awareness class in November 2019. She now \ncompletely realizes that marijuana use is against the law, not responsible conduct, and \nthat it is a \u201cbig deal.\u201d She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal \ndrug use with the acknowledgment that any future involvement with illegal drugs would \nbe grounds for revocation of her security clearance. (Tr. at 41-42, 46-48, 53; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; AE A-C) \n \nApplicant informed her family and management in her company about her drug \nuse. She started in her original company in 1985 when she was 18. Her husband has \nworked for the company almost as long. She rose through the company and earned a \nmanagement position in about 1995. She became better educated, continued to grow \ninto a senior-level manager, and became a director in 2013. She volunteers in her \ncommunity and is well respected by other senior management in her company, as \nreflected by the testimony of another executive, multiple character letters, and other \ndocuments. She is praised for her excellent job performance, strong moral character, \nloyalty, professionalism, leadership, judgment, work ethic, dedication, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and integrity. (Tr. at 16-26, 32-34, 44, 55-60; GE 1; AE D, E, G) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n\n \n5 \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia when \nshe was young. She possessed and used marijuana again from about 2015 through \nAugust 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant went about 30 years without using illegal drugs. During that time, she \ncompleted her education, married, had children, and ascended in her company to a \ndirector position. In spite of all that success, she returned to using marijuana when a \nfriend offered it to her. She succumbed to the change in the perception of marijuana, or \nas she put it, that it was not a \u201cbig deal.\u201d She explained during her background interview \n\n \n6 \n \nthat marijuana use was legal in many states and that at that time, there was less of a \nstigma attached to using marijuana.   \n \n \nApplicant realized after the interview that her marijuana use was inconsistent with \nthe behavior of a responsible adult, senior executive, and potential holder of a security \nclearance. She indicated in her response to the SOR that \u201cself-reflection made [her] \nrealize that this very rare occasion of self-gratification is not worth losing [her] job or \nbeing viewed as someone that can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d Applicant\u2019s recent marijuana use is \ntroubling, particularly her use after submitting the SF 86. An applicant\u2019s use of illegal \ndrugs after having completed a security clearance application raises questions about his \nor her judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03460 at 3 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018). Nonetheless, I am \nconvinced that she has learned a valuable lesson, and her misconduct will not be \nrepeated. \n \n \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug use \nwith the acknowledgment that any future involvement with illegal drugs would be \ngrounds for revocation of her security clearance. She credibly testified that she will not \nuse any illegal drugs in the future. She fully disclosed her drug use on her SF 86 and \nduring her background investigation, which bolsters her credibility. I find that Applicant \nhas abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that illegal drug use is \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \n\n7 \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant's national security eligibility. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 21 , 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 31, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non November 14, 2019, scheduling the hearing for December 9, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. Applicant offered a \npacket of documents, which I marked Applicant's Exhibits (AppXs) A through 0, and \nadmitted into evidence. The record was left open until January 31 , 2020, for receipt of \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nadditional documentation. Applicant offered two additional packets of documents, which \nwere marked as AppXs P and Q and were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on December 17, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b, with the caveat that \nthey were based on identity theft. At his hearing, the SOR was amended to add \nallegation 1.c, a past-due student loan debt to Creditor C in the amount of about \n$43,870. (TR at page 21 line1 to page 22 line 4.) He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c, again \naverring identity theft. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 72-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 5.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor for \u201c19 years.\u201d (TR at page 38 line 7 \nto page 41 line 17.) Applicant is also retired from the U.S. Air Force. (Id.) He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1969. He is married, and has one daughter, who inadvertently \ncaused the identity theft. \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges three past-due student loan debts: $78,909 owed to Creditor A; \n$21,060 owed to Creditor B; and $43,870 owed to Creditor C. The genesis of these \nstudent loans is detailed in an affidavit from Applicant\u2019s daughter. (AppX P at page 2.) \nShe avers: \u201cSince my father had agreed to cosign on the first two student loans, I \nbelieved he would agree to cosign on my other education loans. From October 2006 to \nApril 2008 his information was used on the documents for seven more loans.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant did not agree to; and was unaware of, these additional student loans, three of \nwhich are alleged in the SOR. (TR at page 41 line 18 to page 46 line 19, and AppX B.) \nThis is further supported by an affidavit from Applicant\u2019s wife who avers: \u201cAbout \nNovember of 2015 we started to receive calls from debt collectors asking about \npayments on student loans. This is when my husband became aware of all the loans \nour daughter had taken out without his knowledge.\u201d (AppX Q at page 1.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter is currently involved in a lawsuit against Creditor C. Her \nattorney avers \u201c[Applicant . . .] is not a party to this lawsuit.\u201d (AppX P, emphasis in \noriginal.) This gives further credence to the above averments. \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n  \nNone of these apply. Applicant was unaware of his daughter\u2019s past-due student \nloans. He has not shown poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness. Financial \nConsiderations is found for Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Overall, the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Financial Considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n________________________ \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The action was \ntaken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 10, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 25, 2019, scheduling the hearing for January 14, 2020. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant \n\n \n2 \ntestified and offered exhibits (AE) A through K. There were no objections to any of the \nexhibits offered and all were admitted into evidence. The record was held open until \nJanuary 28, 2020, to permit Applicant to submit additional documents. She timely \nsubmitted AE L through Q, which were admitted into evidence without objection (HE I). \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on January 23, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. She denied \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2012 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She married in 2010. She has a four-year-old child. She \nbegan her current job in October 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to a series of events. In April 2015, her \ndaughter was born prematurely and weighed only one pound four ounces. Due to \ncomplications, Applicant was required to remain in the hospital for a week. The baby \nremained in the neo-natal unit of the hospital for five months. Because of her daughter\u2019s \ncompromised immune system, she was required to drink special formula and had \nadditional expensive medical procedures that were not completely covered by \ninsurance. The medical expenses continued due to the numerous health problems her \ndaughter developed. She is required to wear leg braces that need to be replaced often, \nsometimes every six months as she grows. These are not covered by Applicant\u2019s \ninsurance and can cost more than $400. She also has to wear eyeglasses that are not \ncompletely covered by insurance. Applicant must pay all of these required incidentals \nout-of-pocket.  \n \n \nExacerbating Applicant\u2019s already fragile finances, in April 2016, her husband\u2019s \nvehicle was damaged beyond repair due to a hail storm, which required them to \npurchase a used vehicle to replace the one damaged. In September 2017, Applicant \nwas fired from her job and was unemployed. She collected unemployment benefits. In \nOctober 2017, she started a new job. Her salary was less than her previous job. In \nFebruary 2019, her husband was diagnosed with a serious neurological condition \nresulting in his hospitalization for two weeks. In March 2019, Applicant made an \nemergency trip to another state so she could be with her father before he passed away. \nAll of these events significantly impacted Applicant\u2019s finances.  \n \n \nApplicant provided proof that she has recently resolved the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.c ($790), 1.d ($574), and 1.e ($119). (Answer to the SOR; AE E, G) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has not made any payments toward the student loan \nalleged in SOR \u00b61.a ($19,081). She was aware she owed the loan, but did not have the \nincome to pay it. She filed a request to have the loan forgiven. She attempted to contact \nthe collection company which owns the loan, but can only reach an automated system \n\n \n3 \nthat cannot locate her account. When she speaks with a person, they cannot find her \naccount either. As a result, she stated that she cannot arrange payments. Post-hearing \nshe provided an email from the creditor from 2014 indicating the debt is a private \nstudent loan. (AE M \n \n \nApplicant stated in her answer to the SOR that the lender for her student loan in \n\u00b6 1.b for $3,883 was sued for predatory practices. She provided a copy of IRS Form \n1098-E which shows interest she paid on the loan in 2014. She also provided a copy of \na judgment against the creditor settling claims against it for \u201cany student borrower\u201d who \nreceived a loan that was not paid in full by June 14, 2019. The judgment also required \nthe loans to be discharged and all outstanding balances of all affected customer loan \naccounts, including fees, charges, and interest be cancelled. Applicant testified that she \nresearched the debt on its website and it said the creditor would not be accepting future \npayments. It appears this debt is unenforceable. (AE I, J).  \n \n \nApplicant provided an email dated January 8, 2020, from the \u201cBorrower Defense \nCustomer Service\u201d indicating it was in receipt of her application to have her federal \nstudent loans discharged. A decision has not yet been made. (AE B).  \n \n \nApplicant has 14 student loans that are in forbearance. After her hearing, she \nsubmitted a request to have them consolidated and applied for an income-based \npayment plan. She estimated she owed more than $86,000 for federal student loan. \nShe anticipated the income-based plan would require her to pay $187 monthly if \napproved. These delinquent loans are not alleged in the SOR. (AE L, N, O, Q) \n \n \nApplicant submitted character letters. In them, she is described as trustworthy, \nreliable, honest, hard-working, courteous, dedicated, knowledgeable, professional, \nintelligent, generous, mature, efficient, competent, and friendly. She exercises sound \njudgment and has excellent decision-making skills. She is goal-oriented with a strong \nwork ethic and positive attitude. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \n\n \n4 \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, states that the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing is potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts and student loans that began accumulating in \nabout 2015. She was unable to resolve them. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt, which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant began experiencing financial problems after the premature birth of her \ndaughter in 2015. She then had a series of life events that included additional medical \nexpenses associated with her daughter\u2019s health; a hailstorm that required the purchase \nof a replacement vehicle for her husband; a reduction in income; the hospitalization of \nher husband; and an emergency trip to see her father before he passed away. These \nevents were beyond her control. Although it took her awhile to begin to address her \nfinancial problems, she has paid three of the SOR debts. She attempted to contact the \ncreditor for a private student loan that she owed, but the creditor has been unable to \nfind her account. She realizes she needs to continue to attempt to resolve this loan. A \nsecond private student loan company was sued for predatory practices and these loans \nare likely unenforceable. Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, and she is aware that her \nfederal student loans that were in forbearance will need to be paid. However, she has \nmade progress in addressing her debts and has an understanding of the importance of \nbeing financially responsible so she can continue in her job. It appears she has a handle \non her finances and future problems are unlikely to recur. There is sufficient evidence to \napply mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). \n\n \n6 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. She experienced several life events that impacted her \nfinances. She has made sufficient efforts to resolve her financial problems and \novercome the trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

He failed to disclose any \ndelinquent debts and repossession of his vehicle on his Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Position (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Guidelines F (financial \nconsiderations) and E (personal conduct) security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 26, 2018, Applicant completed and signed an SCA. (Item 3). On July 26, \n2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Item \n1) \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F and E. (Item \n1) \n \nOn August 24, 2019, and October 25, 2019, Applicant provided responses to the \nSOR, and he requested a decision without a hearing. (Item 2) On February 13, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel completed the File of Relevant Material (FORM). On February 26, \n2020, Applicant was served with a copy of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response, if any, was \ndue on March 27, 2020. No response was received. On May 15, 2020, the case was \nassigned to me.  \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR and ADP decisions and \nthe Directive are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations. He also \nprovided some mitigating information. (Item 2)   \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old mechanical technician, and he has worked for a DOD \ncontractor since May 2018. (Item 3 at 7, 13) From November 2011 to May 2018, he \nworked as a technician. (Id. at 14) From September 2009 to October 2011, he worked in \nquality assurance.

(Id. at 20, 22-23)  \n  \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $31,389, and record evidence for \neach debt is as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a debt placed for collection for $12,697. Applicant said he is currently \nin the process of disputing the amount he owes to the creditor. (Item 2 at 1) Applicant\u2019s \nAugust 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows this account was opened on \nMarch 31, 2018, and the status is \u201cConsumer disputes this account information.\u201d (Id. at \n16) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off vehicle loan for $11,250. Applicant\u2019s December 6, 2018 \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) states that the \ndebt resulted from a vehicle loan upon which he defaulted. (Item 7 at 7) His vehicle was \nrepossessed on an unspecified date. (Id.) Applicant said he intended to satisfy the debt \nin 2019. (Id.) Applicant said the account was opened in June 2012, and closed in June \n2015. (Item 2 at 1) He believed this account exceeded the reportable period of seven \nyears. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows this \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \naccount was opened on June 9, 2012, and his last payment was on November 1, 2015. \n(Id. at 5)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a charged-off bank debt for $999. Applicant said he believed this \naccount was opened in May 2012, and it was over seven years old. (Item 2 at 3) \nApplicant\u2019s August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows the account was \nopened on May 1, 2012, and his last payment was on April 1, 2013. (Id. at 11) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $949. Applicant \nsaid he is currently disputing the information in his credit report. (Item 2 at 3) Applicant\u2019s \nAugust 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report shows this account was opened on \nMay 16, 2016, and the status is \u201cConsumer disputes this account information.\u201d (Id. at 16) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off department store debt for $606.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a charged-off department store debt for $452. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $859. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a credit union debt placed for collection for $1,333. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $869. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $675. \n \nFor SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.j, Applicant had the same explanation. Applicant said \nhis credit report was erroneous, and the negative entry was removed from his credit \nreport. (Item 2 at 3) In his August 24, 2019 SOR response, for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \nthrough 1.j, he stated that the negative entry was \u201cremoved.\u201d (Id. at 3) In his October 25, \n2019 SOR response, for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.j, he wrote \u201cI deny\u201d for each \ndebt and explained the entry was removed from his credit report. (Id. at 21-22) Applicant\u2019s \nAugust 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report does not include any of these six \naccounts. (Id.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $404. In his \nDecember 6, 2018 OPM PSI, Applicant acknowledged he had the account in SOR \u00b6 1.k. \n(Item 7 at 5) He said he was erroneously charged for telecommunications equipment that \nhe returned, and he disputed the debt. (Id.) In his SOR response, he indicated the debt \nwas removed from his credit report, and his August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit \nreport does not include this debt. (Item 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $296. Applicant \nsaid the account was fraudulent, and it was removed from his credit report. (Item 2 at 3) \nThe creditor has an open fraud investigation. (Id. at 3) Applicant\u2019s August 18, 2019 \nEquifax/Credit Karma credit report does not include this account. \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nIn his SOR response with respect to his trustworthiness, Applicant said: \n \nI am loyal to the United States, and would never do anything to jeopardize \nnational security or [the] safety of our servicemen and women especially not \nfor financial gain. I have never had a history of drug, alcohol or gambling \nissues. [The] only issue I have had was being [the] sole provider in my \nhousehold and getting behind on my financial obligations due to job \ntransitions and amount of bills. However, I would not jeopardize my honor, \nfreedom or reputation for financial incentive. Also I have cleared up [my] \ncredit report and continue to meet my financial obligations.  (Item 2 at 2)  \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or \nsupporting documentation of resolution of the SOR debts. Aside from Applicant\u2019s \nuncorroborated statements, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant paid, \narranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The \nrecord lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of \nthe causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information. The FORM \ninformed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin which to submit \na documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, \nor explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional \ninformation . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination \nbased solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4 (emphasis in original)) \nHe did not respond to the FORM. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSection 26, \u201cFinancial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts,\u201d of \nApplicant\u2019s June 26, 2018 SCA asked whether in the previous seven years: (1) Applicant \nhad any property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed; (2) Applicant defaulted on any \nloan; (3) Applicant had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; and (4) Applicant \nhad any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed? Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d to all of these questions, and did not disclose any \nnegative financial information or the repossession of his vehicle on his SCA. \n \nApplicant\u2019s December 6, 2018 OPM PSI states \u201cSubject verified no to all financial \nrecord questions.\u201d (Item 7 at 5) In response to follow-up questions during his OPM PSI, \nApplicant verified that he had accounts pertaining to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($11,250), \n1.c ($999), 1.d ($949), 1.e ($606), 1.h ($1,333); 1.j ($675), and 1.k ($404). (Id. at 3-8) He \nhad problems paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and he said he would pay it through a credit \ncounseling service. (Id. at 6) He had problems paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h in 2015, and \nhe attempted to set up a payment plan with the creditor. (Id. at 4) He denied knowledge \nof the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($12,697), 1.f ($452), 1.g ($859), 1.i ($969), and 1.l ($296). \n(Id. at 3-8) \n \nApplicant denied that he intended to provide false information on his SCA. (Item 2 \nat 4) He explained that at the time he completed the SCA, he had not obtained a copy of \nhis credit report. (Id.) He \u201cwas not aware of errors and discrepancies I have now had \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nremoved from report as well as accurate dates and accounts showing delinquent which \nwas a huge oversight on my part.\u201d (Id., emphasis in original)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \n Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $31,389. In his OPM PSI, Applicant \ndenied knowledge of the five accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($12,697), 1.f ($452), 1.g ($859), \n1.i ($969), and 1.l ($296).  Applicant\u2019s August 18, 2019 Equifax/Credit Karma credit report \ndoes not include the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.l; however, the account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($12,697) is in his most recent credit report of record. Applicant presented \nsufficient evidence to rebut the information in his earlier credit reports, and I have credited \nhim with mitigating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.l. \n \nApplicant said he had periods of job transitions (unemployment), and he was the \nsole provider in his household, which are circumstances largely beyond his control. He \ndoes not receive full mitigating credit under AG 20(b) because he did not establish that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. He did not indicate when or how long he \nwas unemployed or in transition between jobs. He did not provide sufficient evidence of \nprogress resolving his delinquent debts. \n \n\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or \nshe maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been either charged off or dropped \nfrom his credit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit report is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, \n2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit \nReporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven \nyears from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because \nof a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See \nFederal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at \nSection 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. \nDebts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt \nis not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s \nrequest for information, or when the debt has been charged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nprovide more evidence of debt resolution precludes mitigation of the charged-off debts on \nhis credit report.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant disputed several negative entries on his credit report. Under AG \u00b6 20(e), \nApplicant has the burden of proving that he \u201chas a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.\u201d He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof\u201d of the basis of the disputes \nor actions to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable with respect to the debts he \ncontested, but nevertheless are documented in his most recent credit report or that he \nadmitted during his OPM PSI.  \n \nApplicant did not provide documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) \nproof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or \na letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of \ncredible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he \ndid not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence \nof attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to \nshow that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or \nresolution.  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to \nmake greater documented progress resolving the eight debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, \n1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being \nresolved and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish \nmitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or the repossession of his vehicle \non his June 26, 2018 SCA. The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for \nanalyzing falsification cases, stating:  \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he lied when initially questioned during his \nDecember 6, 2018 OPM PSI which he stated: \u201cSubject verified no to all financial record \nquestions.\u201d (Item 7) When the OPM investigator confronted him during follow-up \nquestioning about his delinquent debts, he admitted knowledge of several delinquent \naccounts, and that his vehicle was repossessed resulting in a debt for $11,250. He also \nfalsely denied in his SOR response that he was aware of negative financial information \nat the time he completed his SCA. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR \nmay be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). His false initial response to the OPM \ninvestigator and his failure to candidly admit the falsification of his SCA in his SOR \nresponse, will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. He receives \nsome positive credit for admitting during his OPM PSI that he knew about some of the \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR and the repossession of his vehicle. \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose at \nleast one delinquent debt and the repossession of his vehicle on his SCA. In his SOR \nresponse, Applicant failed to take responsibility for the falsification of his SCA when he \nfalsely denied that at the time he completed his SCA he was aware of delinquent debts \nand repossession of his vehicle. His behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old mechanical technician, and he has worked for a DOD \ncontractor since May 2018. From November 2011 to May 2018, he worked as a \ntechnician. From September 2009 to October 2011, he worked in quality assurance. He \nindicated he was the sole provider in his household and had less income due to job \ntransitions (unemployment). In 2006, he received a GED. In 2012, he married, and he \nhas two children who are ages six and nine. There is no evidence of workplace \nmisconduct.    \n \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is substantial. Applicant owes \neight delinquent SOR debts totaling $28,913. There is no evidence of progress (payments \nor payment plans) in the last two years in the resolution of these eight debts. His lack of \nfinancial actions raise unmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nThe protection of national security relies on applicants to self-report conduct that \njeopardizes security, even when that disclosure might damage the applicant\u2019s career. AG \n\u00b6 15 emphasizes the importance to security of applicants providing accurate security-\n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nrelated information. Applicant cannot be trusted to disclose potentially derogatory \nsecurity-related information about himself. He did not establish his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to \nmitigate financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has yet to establish a sufficient track record of payments \ntowards his debts to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On \nAugust 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 30, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2019. On January 14, 2020, \nDOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for February 3, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered documents that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. \nApplicant testified and offered documents that I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough M. All exhibits were admitted without objection. A document Applicant attached \nto his answer was marked and admitted as Answer Attachment (Ans. Att.) 1. I held the \nrecord open after the hearing to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments. He timely submitted documents which I marked as AE N (a performance \nevaluation) and AE O (various letters of recommendation). DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 13, 2020. The record closed on February 24, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.f. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997 and joined the \nNavy. He served in the Navy as a jet engine mechanic from 1997 to 2010, and was \nhonorably discharged as an E-5, with severance pay. He held a clearance in the Navy. \nHe and wife have been married for almost 20 years. She is a homemaker. They have \ntwo children, now ages 18 and 17. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30, 42-43, 103-104, 116) Their son is \nin college, and Applicant helps with his expenses. (Tr. 102-103) \n \n \nApplicant testified that after he left the Navy, he was unemployed for about 18 \nmonths. (Tr. 45) Between April 2011 and mid-2012, he worked overseas on several \nbrief contracts. (Tr. 45-48) Between these contracts, he was unemployed. (GE 1) From \nabout July 2012 to November 2015, Applicant worked for a large defense contractor at \na job in his home state. He was terminated after a dispute with his supervisor over the \nquality of his work. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 50)  \n \nFor much of the next three years, Applicant then worked for an aviation company \nin another part of the state, several hours\u2019 drive from his home. He would return home \non weekends. In that job, he made less money, and had more expenses in gas and \nfood, since he was living away from home. At times during that job, he lived in his car. \n(Tr. 34-38, 113-115)  \n \nApplicant held that job until June 2018, when he began working for his current \nemployer and clearance sponsor, another defense contractor. (Tr. 29; GE 1) In \nApplicant\u2019s most recent work evaluation, for 2018, he either met or exceeded \nexpectations in all respects. (AE N) In April 2019, he took a new position with the \n\n \n3 \n \ncompany, which increased his annual salary from $60,000 to $73,000. (Tr. 29-36, 125-\n126; AE I)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his financial problems initially began when he was \nunemployed after leaving the Navy. They worsened after he was terminated. (Tr. 31-33, \n37-38, 44) When he fell behind on his debts, Applicant worked with credit agencies \n(debt-resolution companies) to address his debts but \u201call they did was take money.\u201d (Tr. \n58, 97)  \n \n \nThe SOR debts total about $22,186. They are established through Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports from September 2018 and March 2019. (GE 2, GE 3) He also disclosed \nseveral of his debts on his SCA and discussed them in his background interview. (GE 1, \nGE 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($14,038) is a charged-off debt to a credit union. Applicant opened the \naccount in 2011 and the date of last activity was September 2014. (GE 2) Applicant said \nthe account was a consolidation loan that he took out to help get his bills under control. \n(Tr. 52-57) The debt remains listed as charged off on more recent credit reports. (AE B \nat 17; AE L at 43) Applicant has contacted the creditor but has not arranged a payment \nplan. (Tr. 59-60, 70-72) The account is not resolved.  \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an auto loan alleged as past due in the amount of $456. Applicant \ndocumented that the account has been current for several months, with a $238 monthly \npayment. (AE C; AE M; Tr. 61-64) The account is current and being resolved.  \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,506) is a charged-off debt to a bank. The debt was charged off in \nJune 2014. (GE 2) It remains past due, and Applicant has not attempted to repay it. (Tr. \n64-67; AE K at 38; AE L at 13) The account is not resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,117) is a debt placed for collection by a bank. Applicant \nestablished that the account has been settled for $1,270 and paid. (AE B; Tr. 65-69) \nThe account is resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,963) is a charged-off debt to the same creditor as for SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe debt, which Applicant incurred when he was still in the Navy, has a date of last \nactivity of July 2014. (GE 2) It remains charged off and unresolved. Applicant intends to \npay it. (AE K at 19-20; AE L at 19; Tr. 65, 69-75) The account is not resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($643) is a charged-off credit account to an auto shop. Applicant \ndenied the debt, asserting that it had been removed from his credit report. He also did \nnot recognize it. (Tr. 76-77, 82-84) The credit reports in the record all show a balance of \n$479 (not the $643 alleged) but the account remains past due. The date of last activity \nis July 2014. (GE 2, GE 3, AE K at 29; AE L at 3) The account is not resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($463) is a charged-off debt to a bank. The date of last activity is July \n2014. (GE 2) It remains past due. (Tr. 98-99; AE K at 12) The account is not resolved.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant testified that he intends to pay all of his delinquent debts. He was told \nby his bank to \u201cpay off anything that\u2019s actionable now, that\u2019s current now, your credit \ncards, your collections\u201d so he could get them to a manageable debt level before \naddressing older debts. He intends to address his debts in this manner going forward, \n(Tr. 59, 70) He has contacted all the creditors for the debts he owes. (Tr. 84-85) \n \nApplicant now earns about $3,800 per month, a salary allowing him more ability \nto pay his debts. (Tr. 113, 118-119). He talked to his bank about financial counseling \nand learned to set aside money in envelopes to pay for certain budgeted items. He says \nthis process is helping him control his expenses. (Tr. 88-94)  \n \n \nApplicant currently has five credit cards, but carries little to no balance on any of \nthem. He has had some of the cards for many years. Other, newer cards have small \ncredit limits in order to boost his credit. (Tr. 86-88, 109-112; AE D \u2013 AE H)  \n \n \nApplicant provided several recommendation letters from references. (AE O) His \nemployer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO), who was involved in Applicant\u2019s hiring process, \nfound him to be easy to work with, patient, respectful, and with a positive outlook. \nAnother reference, a retired Army command sergeant major who recruited Applicant for \nhis current employer, finds Applicant knowledgeable, loyal, and dedicated to his \nemployer\u2019s mission, his family and community. Both references endorse Applicant\u2019s \nability and willingness to protect national security. (AE O) \n \n \nA current supervisor asserts that Applicant has a strong and ethical character \nand is \u201ctrusted to always do the right thing, even when no one is looking.\u201d He is \nhardworking and trustworthy, dependable, honest, responsible, and courteous. (AE O) \nApplicant volunteers in his local community, and a leader of the volunteer program \nattested that Applicant has a great attitude and a good moral character. (AE O) \n \n \nA former co-worker with the aviation company attested that Applicant had been \nhis \u201cright-hand man.\u201d Applicant exceeded expectations in the job, provided excellent \ntechnical expertise, and was a valuable employee. The reference offered strong support \nfor Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. (AE O)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Applicant has had financial delinquencies since he left the Navy. The following \nAGs are applicable in this case:  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant\u2019s car payment, was briefly past-due and is now current. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d has been paid. The other debts in the SOR remain ongoing and unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant worked overseas for a time on brief contracts \nthat offered little job stability. These were conditions beyond his control. However, the \ndebts in the SOR became delinquent later, in mid-2014, according to his credit reports. \nApplicant was employed at the time, and it is unclear why he stopped paying on his \ndebts when he did. He was not terminated until November 2015, after a dispute with a \nsupervisor over the quality of his work.  \n \nAfter he was terminated, Applicant then took a job several hours\u2019 drive away from \nhome to make ends meet, and lived for a time in difficult circumstances while in that \nposition. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some application. He is now in a better-paying job \ncloser to home, a job that affords him the opportunity to better address his debts. \nHowever, as only two of the SOR debts are resolved or now current, he has yet to \nestablish sufficient evidence that he has put his plan into place.  \n \nMost of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts have remained unresolved for several years, and \nhe only recently took steps to resolve them. Applicant testified that he consulted with his \nbank and was advised to pay \u201cactive\u201d debts before those that have been charged off. \n\n \n7 \n \nWhether or not this is a reasonable plan, Applicant has not established a track record of \npayments towards his past-due debts, charged off or otherwise, to show sufficient good \nfaith, or that his past-due debts are being resolved or are under control. He did not \nprovide sufficient evidence that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), or 20(d) should fully apply. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial security concerns over his delinquent debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI credit Applicant\u2019s 13 years in the Navy, with a security clearance, and his efforts \nto pursue employment, often in locations away from home. I also credit his character \nwitnesses, from both his personal life and his job, all of whom vouch for him and \ntestified consistently and credibly to Applicant\u2019s loyalty, dedication, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. But Applicant\u2019s debts have been delinquent for several years, and he \ndid not establish that he undertook efforts until recently to resolve them. While he is now \nin a better position to do so than in the past, he still needs to take concrete steps \ntowards resolving his debts in order to fully mitigate financial security concerns. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate financial security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.e-1.g:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n________________________ \nBraden M.

(Government Exhibit 1.)  On August 5, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 23, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 4, 2019.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 6, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 5, 2019.  The \nGovernment offered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2 which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection. The Applicant offered three exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A through C, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 12, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old.  He is married and has two children.  He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor \nas an Engineer.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes the use of marijuana from \nabout January 2016 to January 2019, while granted a security clearance.  Applicant \nadmits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except allegation 1.c.  He began \nworking for his current employer in 2004.  He obtained a security clearance in 2009.  \nApplicant is an engineering supervisor who oversees nine or ten employees.  He states \nthat he is up to date on all security training.  With the exception of one minor security \ninfraction where he committed a confidential level spill, his security record is \nunblemished.   \n \n \nApplicant married in 2003.  He explained that his wife had a medical marijuana \ncard and purchased marijuana at a dispensary to help her sleep.  Applicant tried it and  \nfound it helpful in improving his sleep.  Applicant understood at the time he used the \nmarijuana that even though it became legal in the state, it was still against Federal law \nand clearly prohibited by the DoD.  Applicant testified that he has undergone numerous \nDoD security briefings and mandatory training offered by his employer.  He decided to \nreveal his marijuana use to the Government when marijuana became legal under state \nlaw, which he believed to be in January 2016.  At that time, his security officer reminded \nhim that marijuana was still against Federal law.  Applicant chose to continue to use \nmarijuana regardless of the Federal law.  He states that he thought it would only be a \nsmall blemish on his record.  He stated that he did not understand the serious \nramifications, and did not realize that he could lose his security clearance because of it.  \nApplicant stated that the last time he used marijuana was the night before his hearing.  \n(Tr. p. 34.)          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that he and his wife continue to use marijuana.  Even his \nchildren know that he uses marijuana.  Applicant states that he is willing to stop using \nmarijuana if he has to, but his preference would be to continue using it if he could.  (Tr. \np. 35.)  He states that he is also willing to subject himself to random drug testing.  (Tr. p. \n36.)   \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant further explained that he does not and has never used marijuana while  \nat work.  He states that at work, he is always clear-headed and his use of marijuana on \nhis personal time has not negatively impact his work product in any way.  Applicant \nstates that he is an advid runner, who participates in numerous running events around \nthe country.  He is committed to training, eating, and sleeping correctly.  (Tr. p. 39.)  He \ntestified that he ran the Boston Marathon in April, all while smoking marijuana.  (Tr. p. \n40.)  He states that he was not \u201chigh\u201d during the run, but he did smoke marijuana.  He \nbelieves that marijuana is a performance enhancer for him, and he has had a faster \nrecovery time when he smokes marijuana.   \n \n \nApplicant testified that he believes he is an excellent candidate for a security \nclearance.  He is educated, financially responsible, a native-born American citizen, has \nno foreign contacts, has never been arrested, is athletic and healthy, and comes from a \nlong line of military veterans, as both his father and step-father are Navy and Army \nveterans respectively.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPerformance reviews of the Applicant for the periods from 2006 through the \npresent reflect that he either \u201chighly meets\u201d or \u201cexceeds\u201d his job requirements in every \ncategory.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \n\n \n4 \n \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Applicant is an experienced \nengineer who has worked in the defense industry for over fifteen years.  He is a \nsupervisor who holds a security clearance, who uses marijuana, and has used it for the \npast three years.  His most recent use of marijuana occurred the night before his \nsecurity clearance hearing.  He understands that it is against Federal law, and is \ncognizant of DoD policies that prohibit its use, but has chosen to use it nevertheless.  \nThere is no excuse for this misconduct, and his actions do not show the requisite good \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified \ninformation.   \n \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized \nrelease \nof \nsensitive \ncorporate \nor \ngovernment protected information; and \n \n(2) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nThere are mitigating security concerns under AG\u00b6 17.  However, none of them \nare applicable here.     \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance shows poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  To use marijuana the night before the \nhearing shows complete disregard for the process, and a high degree of immaturity and \npoor judgment.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable here.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is a well-educated, experienced \nengineer whose job it is to supervise others in the work place.  He holds a security \nclearance and uses marijuana in his personal time.  His most recent use of marijuana \ntook place the night before his security clearance hearing.  Regarding his illegal drug \nuse, there is nothing more to say.  At this time, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/26/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on December 28, \n2016. On November 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines H and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 24, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On December 26, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 4. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on January 2, 2020, \n\n \n2 \n \nand timely submitted his response, to which the Government did not object. Applicant did \nnot object to any of the Items included in the FORM. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the \ncase. Items 2 through 4 are admitted into evidence. I sua sponte took administrative \nnotice of several documents, as discussed below, which I appended to the record as \nHearing Exhibits (HE) I through VII. The case was assigned to me on February 24, 2020. \n \nOn March 9, 2020, I emailed the parties to reopen the record in order to afford \nApplicant the opportunity to clarify his statements about obtaining counsel to represent \nhim in this matter. Applicant chose to proceed without counsel. I admitted one of the \nemails I received from Applicant while the record was reopened as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \nA, without objection by the Government. I marked the other emails exchanged, \ncollectively, as HE VIII. I closed the record on April 24, 2020. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nRelevant federal guidance \u2013 issued by: the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) in May 2015 (HE I); the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in August 2016 \n(HE II) and April 2020 (HE III); the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in January 2018 \n(HE IV); and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in February 2018 \n(HE V) \u2013 make clear that: marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under \nfederal law; changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by states, territories, and the \nDistrict of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines; \nand federal marijuana laws supersede state laws.  \n \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) advised that that \u201c[a]n \nindividual\u2019s disregard of federal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana \nremains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d (HE VI at 2) \n \nIn 2016, the state in which Applicant resides enacted a law allowing for recreational \nuse of marijuana, including cultivating marijuana plants in one\u2019s home. (HE VII).  \n \nI sua sponte took administrative notice of the foregoing and the fact that use and \npossession of marijuana is a criminal violation of federal law. I appended the referenced \nguidance to the record as HE I through VII. Because these sua sponte actions did not \naffect either the relative positions of the parties or my decision, prior notice to the parties \nwas not required. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 62, has been married to his second wife since 1991. He has one \nminor child and four adult children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979, a master\u2019s \ndegree in 1982, and a doctorate degree in 1986. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor as a chief scientist since March 2016. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant was previously granted a DOD security clearance in 1987, when he \nworked as a civilian employee of the U.S. military. He maintained that clearance until he \nseparated from that employment in 1988. He submitted a SCA in December 2016, \n\n \n3 \n \nsponsored by his current employer. The DOD CAF granted Applicant an interim security \nclearance in April 2017, pending its adjudication of the matter. That interim clearance was \nsuspended in November 2019, on the same day the SOR was issued, because the DOD \nCAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the matter be submitted to an \nadministrative judge for final adjudication. (Item 2 at 51; Item 4) \n \nThe SOR alleged Guideline H concerns involving Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, \nincluding while he was in possession of the interim clearance granted in April 2017. It also \nalleged Guideline E concerns involving Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his \nmarijuana use on his 2016 SCA and during a 2018 security clearance interview. Applicant \nadmitted three of the four Guideline H allegations and denied both Guideline E \nallegations. (Item 1) \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in 1973 when he was in high school. He \ncontinued to use it until he was granted a security clearance in 1987. He resumed using \nmarijuana in 1988 once he separated from the employment that required him to maintain \nthat clearance. He continued to use it until February 2019. (Item 1; Item 3 at 4-8) \n \nApplicant asserted that he stopped using marijuana in February 2019 because he \napplied for a security clearance. He understands that marijuana use is incompatible with \nmaintaining a security clearance. He denied using marijuana at any time that he \n\u201cknowingly\u201d possessed a security clearance. He maintained that he has neither held an \nactive security clearance nor been in a position where his \u201cparticipation required any \nclearance\u201d since 1988. Although he admitted that he \u201cmay\u201d have used marijuana while \nhis interim clearance was active, he could not recall any specific occurrence. He claimed \nthat he did not know that he had been granted an interim clearance because he was \nnever formally advised of such. However, he acknowledged that his supervisor \u201conce\u201d \ninformally advised him in an \u201coff-hand telephone comment\u201d that an interim clearance had \nbeen conveyed to him. The timing of that phone call was not specified in the record. (Item \n1; Item 3 at 4-8; FORM response) \n \nOn his December 2016 SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to each question about \nillegal drug use, and did not otherwise report any illegal drug use therein. He certified that \nthe statements made in his SCA were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his] \nknowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith.\u201d He was interviewed twice in \nconnection with his SCA \u2013 in October 2018 and February 2019. The investigator who \ninterviewed him summarized the statements that Applicant made during those interviews. \nIn September 2019, Applicant affirmed the accuracy of the facts about his marijuana use \nin those summaries. (Items 2, 3) \n \nDuring the first interview, Applicant volunteered that he had unsuccessfully \nattempted to grow three marijuana plants in his home in March 2017. He stated that this \nactivity was legal in his home state. He advised that he did not intend to grow marijuana \nin the future. During the interview, he neither admitted to nor disclosed any marijuana \nuse. (Item 2 at 49-50; Item 3 at 14) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nDuring the second interview, Applicant admitted to using marijuana from 1973 \nthrough February 2019 (one week prior to the second interview). He maintained that he \nhad never used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. He claimed that he did \nnot list his marijuana use on his SCA \u201cdue to his mistake.\u201d There was no explanation as \nto why he did not disclose his marijuana use during the first interview. He revealed that \nhis wife uses marijuana. He admitted his intent to use marijuana in the future because it \nis \u201cenjoyable,\u201d but maintained that he would never use it while he was in possession of a \nsecurity clearance. During the interview, he acknowledged that marijuana use was \nconsidered illegal under federal laws. (Item 3 at 18-19)   \n \nAt various times during the security clearance investigative process, Applicant \nproffered inconsistent statements about the frequency of his marijuana use. During the \nsecond interview, he stated that he used marijuana at home \u201cabout one time per week.\u201d \nIn his SOR answer, he stated that he used it \u201cnot more than one to two times per month\u201d \nfrom 1973 through 1987, and \u201cnot more than one to three times a year\u201d from 1988 through \n2019. In his FORM response, he denied that he ever used marijuana once a week and \nasserted that any statement he made to the contrary resulted from him inaccurately \nestimating his use due to the vagueness of the questions he was asked. He averred that \nbetween 1973 and February 2019, he used marijuana \u201cless than once every two months.\u201d \nHe acknowledged that his marijuana use was most frequent during his college years, but \nasserted that he has \u201cseldom\u201d used it in the years since 1988, to the point where he was \n\u201chard-pressed\u201d to recall any specific instances. He also maintained that there have been \n\u201cdecades\u201d between 1973 and 2019 when he \u201cneither encountered nor used marijuana.\u201d \n(Item 1; Item 3 at 18; FORM response) \n \nApplicant readdressed his intent to use marijuana in the future in both his SOR \nanswer and FORM response. In his SOR answer, he stated the following: \u201cI have stated \nneither the intent nor the preclusion. I do not intend, though it may occur. It certainly will \nnot occur if I am carrying a clearance.\u201d In his FORM response, he denied expressing any \nintent to use marijuana in the future. He acknowledged: \u201cI may use marijuana in the future, \njust as I may eat catfish, sometime in the future,\u201d which he argued does not constitute an \nintent to use marijuana in the future.  \n  \nIn his SOR answer, with respect to why he failed to report his marijuana use on his \nSCA, Applicant asserted: \u201cBecause private marijuana use was legalized [in the state in \nwhich he resided] in December 2016, I believed my response to the question was correct, \nand not \u2018falsified.\u2019 Furthermore, I cannot identify a specific date or event in the seven \nyears prior to [the date that he certified his SCA] that I used an illegal drug or controlled \nsubstance.\u201d He denied that he lied during his first interview. He asserted: \u201cI have been \nhonest in my written statements, and I have been honest and transparent with the \ninvestigator. The admission that I planted three seeds illustrates that fact.\u201d  \n \nAt the conclusion of his SOR answer, he stated the following: \n \nI am disappointed and humbled that my access to classified information has \nnot been found to be consistent with the national interest. I believe that my \n10 years of service to the federal government strongly demonstrates the \n\n \n5 \n \nconverse. Nevertheless I accept the finding, but wish the associated record \nto be accurate. Were I granted a clearance, there would be no marijuana \nuse. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \n\n \n6 \n \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25 (g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \n \nThe SOR alleged facts that rendered the following additional disqualifying \ncondition potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 25 (f) any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position. Even if Applicant had not been \nworking in a position that required him to have a security clearance, his interim clearance \ngranted him access to classified information. Although he could not recall a specific \ninstance of marijuana use during the time when his interim clearance was active, his \nadmitted \u201cone to three times a year\u201d or \u201cless than once every two months\u201d use of \nmarijuana would have occurred on at least one occasion between April 2017 and \nNovember 2019. Thus, I find that there is sufficient evidence to establish AG \u00b6 25(f).  \n\n \n7 \n \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use spanned 46 years, beginning in 1973 and continuing \nuntil one week before his second security clearance interview in February 2019. During \nthat time, according to Applicant, there were significant periods when he did not use \nmarijuana. Given his lack of candor throughout the process, I question the frequency of \nthe marijuana use that he self-reported. Nevertheless, in the context of evaluating his \nsecurity clearance worthiness, the frequency of his use is less important than the timing \nof his use. Of particular significance is his continued use of marijuana after he submitted \nhis 2016 SCA and after he underwent his first security clearance interview in 2018. While \nthat alone could render Applicant ineligible to possess a security clearance, his lack of \ncandor about his marijuana use underscores a pattern of questionable judgment that \nfurther calls into question his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.  \n \nEven if Applicant was not formally made aware that he had been granted an interim \nclearance, he had actual notice of it after the conversation he had with his supervisor. \nBecause the record did not specify when that conversation took place, arguably, it could \nhave happened after he stopped using marijuana in February 2019. Regardless, based \non the plain language of AG \u00b6 25(f), Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while having the access \nto classified information that his interim clearance afforded him remains an unmitigated \nconcern whether or not he had formal or actual notice of his access. \n \nApplicant has not established a sufficient pattern of abstinence in light of the \nrecency and circumstances of his marijuana use. His wife continues to use marijuana. \nThe fact that Applicant\u2019s home state has allowed recreational use of marijuana since 2016 \ndoes not alter the federal prohibition or existing national security guidelines concerning \nmarijuana use. Not only has Applicant used marijuana in contravention of federal law, but \nhe also violated state law for a significant period. Applicant acknowledged that marijuana \nuse is illegal under federal laws and incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. \nHowever, he not only indicated that he might use marijuana in the future at times when \nhe is not in possession of a security clearance, but he failed to clearly and convincingly \n\n \n8 \n \ncommit to abstinence. I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is unlikely \nto recur and have significant doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use and his failure to be honest about it during multiple \nstages of the security clearance investigative process establish the above-stated general \nconcern and the following specific disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \n\n \n9 \n \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time of the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \nAn applicant\u2019s education and experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to \ndisclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of marijuana use, including during the seven years \nreportable on his SCA. I did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations and excuses for his \nfailure to report any of his drug use on his SCA or during his first security clearance \ninterview. At every stage of the process, Applicant quibbled over details about the facts \nand circumstances of his marijuana use. That quibbling not only damaged his credibility \nbut also suggested that he was aware of the potentially negative impact his marijuana \nuse could have on his security clearance. I find substantial evidence of an intent on the \npart of Applicant to omit and conceal materially relevant information from his SCA and to \nthe investigator during his first interview. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established.  \n \nNone of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline \nare established: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting \na security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the honesty of the \napplicant. Beginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application, \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or \n\n \n10 \n \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002)) \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use and failure to be candid about it on his SCA and during \nhis first security clearance interview evinces a pattern of poor judgment that also reveals \nan inability and unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. His deliberate \nlack of candor is particularly egregious given his background and experience. Applicant \nfailed to demonstrate a sufficient pattern of responsible behavior for me to conclude that \nhis questionable judgment is behind him. I have serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his marijuana use and his lack of candor about it during the security \nclearance investigative process. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

A bankruptcy petition \nin 2000 occurred under circumstances unrelated to commercial credit accounts and \nstudent loans that became delinquent as his second marriage was ending. Information \nabout his actions to address those debts, and the strength of his current finances, is \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn November 16, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for a security clearance \nrequired for his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn August 14, 2019, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was part of the current set \nof adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on November 25, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing on \nJanuary 28, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2020. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A - E. All \nexhibits were admitted without objection. The record remained open after the hearing to \nallow Applicant to submit additional relevant information. The record closed on February \n7, 2020, after I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions and Department Counsel\u2019s \nwaiver of objection thereto. They have been admitted without objection as Applicant \nExhibits (AX) F \u2013 J. HX 1 is the Index of Government Exhibits. HX 2 is a copy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated November 15, 2019. (Tr. 18 \u2013 36) \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant raised a question about the actual status of his security \nclearance eligibility. He averred he was advised on January 27, 2020 by his employer\u2019s \nsecurity officer that his clearance had been granted. (Tr. 6 \u2013 8, 36 \u2013 37) I asked \nDepartment Counsel to verify Applicant\u2019s status. A copy of the email January 27, 2020 \nemail to which Applicant referred, and Department Counsel\u2019s response on February 3, \n2020, are included in the record as HX 3. In response, Department Counsel enclosed \ninformation from the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) that showed Applicant\u2019s \ninterim eligibility for a security clearance was withdrawn on January 27, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that in July 2000, Applicant filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition that was discharged in October 2000 (SOR 1.a). It was also \nalleged that Applicant owed $87,089 for 14 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.o).  \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a, but he denied the remaining \nallegations. He also provided a six-page excerpt from a September 25, 2019 credit report, \nas well as a one-page explanatory statement. (Answer)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s denials created issues of controverted fact as to SOR 1.b \u2013 1.o, and \nrequired the Government to produce sufficient reliable information to establish those \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nallegations as facts. (Directive, E3.1.14) The information presented in GX 1, 2, and 4 \nsatisfied that requirement. In addition, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and works for a defense contractor. He was hired by his \nemployer in February 2017 and relocated to State A from State B, where he lived and \nworked following his retirement from the military. Applicant served in the United States \nCoast Guard from December 1984 until October 2013, when he retired as a Chief Warrant \nOfficer 3 (CWO3) after a career in aviation assignments. Applicant also served in the \nUnited States Air Force between September 1978 and September 1982, and in the United \nStates Army Reserve from October 1982 until December 1984. Applicant first received a \nsecurity clearance in 1985. His certificate of discharge lists numerous personal awards \nand was authorized to wear several unit-based awards. (Answer; GX 1; AX A; Tr. 42) \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice. The dates and circumstances of his first \nmarriage were not listed in his e-QIP and not otherwise developed in the record. In July \n2000, around the time he averred his first marriage ended, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy liquidation of the marital debts for which he was responsible. He was the sole \ndebtor listed in that petition and his debts were discharged in October 2000. (Answer; GX \n3; Tr. 39) \n \n \nApplicant remarried in March 2001. As of the hearing, he and his second wife had \nbeen separated since September 2015. Her subsequent return to State B was one factor \nthat has delayed finalization of a divorce. Since they separated, Applicant has paid about \n$4,200 each month in spousal support. Applicant claims that one reason for the failure of \ntheir marriage was his wife\u2019s failure to manage their finances and pay bills on time as the \nprincipal manager of their joint finances. At all times during their marriage, Applicant was \nserving in the military but was able to be co-located with his wife wherever he was \nassigned. He believes his wife purposefully hid their unpaid debts from him and was able \nto stay ahead of collectors and collection notices because they moved every two or three \nyears for his military postings. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 47, 71 \u2013 72) \n \n \nMost of the debts documented herein are for student loans Applicant obtained \nbetween 2003, when he began studies for an associate\u2019s degree, and 2013, when he \ncompleted studies for a master\u2019s degree in business administration. While Applicant was \na full-time student, his loans were in forbearance and in good standing, but still accruing \ninterest. The debts alleged at SOR 1.c \u2013 1.g and 1.i, totaling $33,484, are for student \nloans that became delinquent in 2014 and 2015. Applicant consolidated those accounts \nin July 2018 and makes one $400 student loan payment on the 4th of each month through \nautomatic debit from his checking account. These accounts are in good standing. \n(Answer; GX 1 - 6; AX B; AX C; Tr. 39 \u2013 40, 48 \u2013 49, 73, 81) \n \n \nAnother delinquent student loan, with a balance due of $47,168, is alleged at SOR \n1.b and represents 47 percent of the total debt documented by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. Unlike the other six student loans discussed above, this account is listed as \na joint account. At his October 9, 2018, subject interview (SI) with a government \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ninvestigator, Applicant averred this account had been consolidated with his other student \nloans. The investigator asked Applicant to provide documentation regarding his \nconsolidated accounts. On October 16, 2018, Applicant provided documentation that \nsupported his claims regarding SOR 1.c \u2013 1.g and 1.i, but produced no information about \nSOR 1.b. At his hearing, Applicant again claimed the debt had been consolidated with the \nothers; however, he eventually acknowledged that the debt was for a student loan he had \nco-signed for his estranged wife and that he likely had not included that account in his \nconsolidation effort. As of May 2019, this account was still being reported on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report. Three days after his hearing, Applicant established a \u201ctemporary payment \narrangement\u201d with the law firm that holds the account for collection to begin resolving the \n$47,282 balance due. Starting on February 21, 2020, Applicant was to make $400 \nmonthly payments through June 21, 2020. At that time, Applicant will be able to negotiate \na further resolution of his debt. (Answer; GX 2; AX G; Tr. 52 \u2013 62) \n \n \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.h is for a past-due utility bill from State B that was \nreferred for collection in February 2016. Applicant was unaware of the debt during his SI. \nAt hearing, he testified that he was still unaware of what the debt was for; however, after \nthe hearing, he was able to contact the creditor and make an initial nominal payment as \na precursor to a negotiated settlement. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 6; AX I; Tr. 62) \n \n \nThe debts at SOR 1.j and 1.k represent two delinquent credit card accounts from \nthe same lender that were charged off as business losses in January 2013 and December \n2012, respectively. Applicant paid off the SOR 1.k account in 2018. The account at SOR \n1.j is no longer collectable because the creditor charged it off as a business loss. Applicant \nincorrectly believed that charging off a debt meant it was no longer his responsibility. \n(Answer; GX 3 \u2013 5; AX H; AX J; Tr. 62 \u2013 66) \n \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.l is for a delinquent cell phone account. A 2017 credit report \nlisted the debt as \u201cin dispute.\u201d According to a May 2019 credit report, Applicant paid the \ndebt through a negotiated settlement for less than the full amount past due. (GX4; GX 5; \nTr. 66 \u2013 67) \n \n \nApplicant stated during his SI and at hearing that he had paid the debts at SOR \n1.m \u2013 1.o. Applicant provided only handwritten notes about those debts during his SI. At \nhearing, he relied on the absence of those debts in his credit report; however, after the \nhearing he presented information showing they have been resolved. (GX 2; GX 4 \u2013 6; AX \nD; AX F; Tr. 67 \u2013 68) \n \n \nAll of the debts at issue in this case involve accounts that were opened well before \nApplicant and his wife separated in 2015. All of the non-student loan debts became \ndelinquent before the separation. As to his current finances, Applicant is in good standing \nwith all of his monthly obligations. His monthly income derives from his defense contractor \npay, his military retired pay, and a disability benefit from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA). After withholdings for taxes and insurance, as well as for his monthly spousal \nsupport obligations, Applicant brings home about $14,800. In 2018, he obtained a \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nmortgage to buy the house he had lived in as a renter beginning in 2017. Applicant is in \nthe process of refinancing his mortgage at an annual interest rate about three percent \nlower than his current mortgage. He has not missed any mortgage payments. (Answer; \nGX 4 \u2013 6; AX B \u2013 D; Tr. 40 \u2013 41, 45, 47, 77, 80 \u2013 81)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531)  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts, \ntotaling $87,089. Those debts arose after he was discharged of other debts in a previous \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. That information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nBy contrast, available information shows that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy occurred \nnearly 20 years ago under circumstances unrelated to his current financial concerns. The \nrecord also shows that only the debts alleged in SOR 1.b and 1.h remain unresolved. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant began the process of resolving both debts, which were not \naddressed when his marriage ended. The most significant debt at issue here is SOR 1.b. \nThat debt arose when he co-signed a student loan for his estranged wife. Although \nApplicant had consolidated all of the student loans for which he was solely responsible, \nhe had not taken any action to resolve SOR 1.b and could not explain why during his \nhearing. Nonetheless, the record evidence as a whole shows that his inattention to that \ndebt was born of mistake rather than an unwillingness or inability to repay the debt. After \nthe hearing, he began repayment through a law firm that holds that account for collection. \nGiven the strength of Applicant\u2019s current financial resources, it is likely he will be able to \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nsatisfy that debt in the foreseeable future. All of the foregoing supports application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare an isolated segment of his background. His bankruptcy nearly 20 years ago has no \nconnection to his more recent debts, most of which are student loans. The record also \nshows that his debts are being resolved to the best of his ability, and that they are unlikely \nto recur. Applicant did not incur his delinquent debts through misconduct or irresponsible \nfinancial practices and he has, with few exceptions, demonstrated good judgment in \naddressing his debts while meeting all of his other financial obligations. Further, balanced \nagainst the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s debts is a long record of incident-free \naccess to classified information during a 35-year military career.  A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns about his financial problems. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \n  For Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, are not mitigated. Applicant\u2019s 2007 arrest for \nmarijuana possession is dated, but mitigation of the security concern under Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct, is not established, due to his subsequent marijuana use. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 6, 2016. \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline J, criminal \nconduct. DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 29, 2019 and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. On December 3, 2019, \nDOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2019. Applicant\u2019s \nhearing occurred as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were marked and \nadmitted without objection. Applicant had provided three documents with his Answer. \nThey were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A, B, and C, and admitted without \nobjection. He also testified. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 24, 2020.  \n \nEvidentiary Issues \n \n \nFirst, sua sponte, I amended SOR \u00b6 2.a during the hearing by adding the word \n\u201cwith\u201d so that the allegation is grammatically correct. The parties did not object. (Tr. 28-\n29) SOR \u00b6 2.a now reads, \u201cYou were arrested in about July 2007 in [name of state], and \ncharged with possession of marijuana.\u201d (Emphasis added). \n \n \nSecond, Applicant did not object to the admission of GE 2, the unauthenticated \nsummary of his May 2018 background interview, and it was admitted. However, he also \ndrew attention to a specific sentence in GE 2 that he did not adopt. That sentence was \ntherefore stricken from GE 2 without objection, and I have not considered it. (GE 2 at 6; \nTr. 21-22, 38-42)  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, all with explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.a, \nbut only as to the date of the arrest. His admissions and statements are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He and his wife have been married for about three and \na half years. They have two young children. Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2004, his master\u2019s degree in 2007, and his Ph.D. in 2013. He then spent about two \nyears in a post-doctorate fellowship in Europe, until December 2015. He was \nunemployed for most of 2016, until beginning his current job with a defense contractor \nin the United States, in October 2016. He has a $135,000 annual salary. (Tr. 29-33, 44-\n46; GE 1; GE 2)  \n \n \nDuring his years in school, Applicant was in a band. During the summer of 2007, \nthe band was on tour in a large U.S. city several hundred miles from his home. One \nnight, before a performance, Applicant was sitting in the back of the band\u2019s van, \nreading. Two others got into the front seats and began to smoke marijuana. This drew \nthe attention of a nearby police officer, and all of the occupants of the van were pulled \nout and arrested. (Tr. 34-35, 56-58; GE 2 at 5)  \n \n \nApplicant spent about 20 hours in jail and was arraigned in court the next day on \na charge of possession of marijuana. He said he was advised by legal counsel to plead \n\n \n3 \n \n \nno contest so he would not have to return to court, in a city far from his home, to dispute \nthe charge. He was placed on unsupervised probation for a year, after which the charge \nwould be dismissed. (Tr. 33-37; Answer; GE 2) Applicant testified that he did not use \nmarijuana during his period of probation. (Tr. 79)  \n \n \nApplicant reported the arrest on his SCA, giving an estimated date of July 2007 \n(as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a). (GE 1 at 68) In his Answer and at hearing, he gave the date \nas June 2007. (Tr. 34) He has had no subsequent arrests or offenses. (Tr. 73-74) \n \nApplicant denied using marijuana on that particular occasion. (Tr. 35) He \nprovided a character letter from a friend of his who was there that night. In the letter, the \nfriend also provided factual details that largely comport with Applicant\u2019s explanation of \nwhat happened. (AE C) The record does not include police or court documents about \nthe offense. In the letter, the friend also vouches for Applicant\u2019s character.  \n \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in 1997, when he was in high school. He \nreported his marijuana use on his October 2016 SCA. He reported daily use of \nmarijuana from 1997 to 2000. He also said, \u201cI smoke marijuana on occasion\u201d with a \nfrequency of \u201cmonthly or less.\u201d (GE 1 at 70) (SOR \u00b6 1.b)  \n \n \nApplicant also used marijuana while he was living in Europe. He knew it was \nillegal to possess marijuana in the country where he lived. (Tr. 59-61, 69) He also knew \nthat his use and possession of marijuana was illegal in the U.S. under federal law. (Tr. \n70-71) \n \nApplicant testified that he used marijuana about three times after filling out his \nSCA. His use was confined to his home. (Tr. 71) His last use of marijuana was in \nDecember 2017. (Tr. 76-77, 80) He acknowledged that engaging in illegal activity (by \ncontinuing to use marijuana) while applying for a clearance was \u201ca bit of a \ncontradiction.\u201d (Tr. 73) Applicant testified that it became clear to him during his \nbackground interview (May 2018) that his marijuana use might negatively impact his \neligibility for access to classified information. (Tr. 80-81) He testified, however, that he \nthought he might not be granted a clearance, not because of the drug use, but because \nof his foreign ties. (Tr. 39, 61-62) \n \n \nApplicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms from January 1999 to May 2014, \nabout 10 times. (SOR \u00b6 1.d)(Tr. 50-51) He used the prescription medication oxycodone, \nwithout a prescription, a few times between May 2005 and May 2014. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Tr. \n52-54, 66-67) Applicant disclosed his use of these substances on his SCA, and \ndiscussed his use in his background interview. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant testified that if he \nwere offered such substances again, he would not accept them. \n \n \nApplicant also disclosed on his SCA that he used poppy tea, from January 2007 \nto May 2013, about 50 times. (GE 1)(SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant\u2019s practice was to purchase \nthe poppy seeds legally from a flower store, and then grind the seeds up and steep \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthem in tea. The physiological effect upon consuming the tea was like a sedative or an \nopiate. (Tr. 54-55, 68-69) \n \n \nIn mitigation, Applicant testified that he is older and now has a family, as well as \na job he enjoys. He recognizes that holding a clearance is important to him. His current \ncircumstances are \u201cincompatible with any drug use.\u201d He said his desire to use marijuana \nhas disappeared. He has found the effects of the drug to be physically taxing, and \u201cnot \ncompatible with [the] responsibilities I have as a parent or as an employee.\u201d (Tr. 43-44, \n69-70) He cited having children as the biggest change in his lifestyle. (Tr. 77-78) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he no longer attends parties or associates with people \nwho use marijuana. His last use, in December 2017, was with a friend who now lives in \nanother part of the state. They are no longer in regular contact. Applicant\u2019s wife does \nnot use marijuana, though she did rarely use it in the past. (Tr. 48-49, 65, 75-77) \nApplicant has never been diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder. He has never \nparticipated in drug treatment or counseling. (Tr. 80-81) \n \n \nApplicant provided a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. He acknowledged that any future such involvement would be \ngrounds for revocation of his national security eligibility. (AE A) He intends to abstain \nfrom illegal drugs entirely. (Tr. 87) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a cover letter to convey his \u201cabsolute trust\u201d in \nApplicant\u2019s character and judgment. He has known Applicant for many years. He \nregards Applicant as trustworthy and reliable, and an excellent performer and a leader \nat work. Applicant is responsible and credible, and is well qualified to hold a clearance. \n(AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 are potentially applicable: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \nWhen he was a student, Applicant used a variety of illegal substances and \nmisused substances that were otherwise legal. This included hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, poppy tea, and prescription oxycodone that was not prescribed to him. \nApplicant\u2019s use of those substances ended in 2013 or 2014. He also has a 20-year \nhistory of marijuana use, from 1997 to December 2017. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.d. SOR \u00b6 25(c) would apply to Applicant\u2019s 2007 arrest for marijuana possession, \nbut that offense was not alleged under Guideline H.  \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all  drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d all concern Applicant\u2019s use of illegal substances, or \nmisuse of otherwise legal substances, that ended in May 2014, more than five years \nago. Those allegations are mitigated by the passage of time, under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b). \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use is a different matter. He began using marijuana in high \nschool, in 1997. He used it daily until 2000, and used it less frequently after that. Along \nwith his other disclosures, he disclosed his marijuana use on his October 2016 SCA. He \ndescribed his marijuana use in the present tense: \u201cI smoke marijuana on occasion\u201d with \na frequency of \u201cmonthly or less.\u201d Applicant used marijuana three more times, at home. \nHis last use was in December 2017 -- before his May 2018 background interview, but \nalso well after his October 2016 SCA.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant testified that his job is important to him and he would like to be granted \na clearance because of the professional opportunities that would become available as a \nresult. Through the clearance application process, he realized, if belatedly, that drug \nuse is \u201cincompatible\u201d with his current circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has undergone significant changes in recent years. He has completed \nhis education, including his Ph.D., and finished his post-doctoral fellowship. He has left \nthe world of academia and entered the defense industry. He has also married and is \nnow the father of two young children. All of this, particularly fatherhood, has \nunderstandably had an impact on his lifestyle and outlook, and it weighs heavily in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nHowever, Applicant also has a 20-year history of marijuana use, beginning in \nhigh school and continuing well into adulthood. His use continued after his 2007 arrest \nand probation period. He used marijuana despite knowing that it was, and remains, \nillegal under U.S. federal law, as well as in the country where he lived overseas. \n \nMost troubling, Applicant used marijuana after submitting his SCA, in October \n2016. He recognizes now that his illegal use of marijuana while in the security clearance \napplication process is \u201ca bit of a contradiction,\u201d as he put it. The DOHA Appeal Board \nhas held that \u201cdrug involvement after having completed an SCA draws into serious \nquestion the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations, insofar as it placed the applicant on notice of the consequences of such \nmisconduct.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 16-02877 at 3 (Oct. 2, 2017); ISCR Case No. 15-01905 at \n2 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2017).  \n \nApplicant testified that he has no desire to use marijuana again and does not \nintend to do so. He provided a statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. He \nhas also disassociated from those who use drugs. AG \u00b6 26(b) therefore has some \napplication. However, particularly when balanced against Applicant\u2019s 20-year-history of \nknowingly illegal marijuana use, his two years of abstinence from marijuana is simply \nnot enough to warrant full mitigation under either AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or (b).  \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is applicable: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2007 and charged with possession of marijuana. \nHe disputes that he was using marijuana at the time. He pled no contest, choosing not \nto dispute the charge, which would have required him to return to the court, in a city far \nfrom home. Nonetheless, the fact of the arrest is sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 31(b).  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions:    \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s single arrest occurred 12 years ago, when he was a graduate \nstudent. In subsequent years, he continued to pursue higher education, eventually \nearning a Ph.D. He has an excellent employment record. He married and has two \nyoung children. Applicant has had no further arrests or offenses. However, he continued \nto use marijuana on a fairly regular basis until December 2017, and did so knowing it \nwas illegal. This constitutes subsequent criminal activity, even though it did not lead to \nadditional arrests. Applicant\u2019s subsequent involvement with marijuana precludes \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and J in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is clearly intelligent and hardworking, and he has earned significant \nacademic and professional success. He has married and started a young family, as well \nas a new career. His assertions that he has changed and matured are sincere. \nHowever, he still has a 20-year track history of marijuana use. He regarded himself as a \ncurrent and regular marijuana user as recently as October 2016, when he prepared his \nSCA, and he kept using marijuana, if less frequently, until December 2017. Given his \nhistory, Applicant needs to establish a longer track record of abstinence from illegal \ndrug use and compliance with rules, regulations, and the law before he can be trusted \nwith access to classified information.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \nJanuary 27, 2020 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant defaulted on four bank debts. She provided insufficient \nevidence in mitigation. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 29, 2018, Applicant submitted an application for a public trust position \n(Application). On July 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guidelines F.  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 1, 2019, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Answer). She admitted, with \nexplanation, the four SOR allegations.  \nOn or about September 5, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM) that referenced seven attached \ndocuments identified as Items 1-7. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to \n\n2 \n \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit a written \nresponse and documents to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by \nthe SOR allegations within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM.  \n \nItem 5 attached to the FORM is a summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview, \nwhich was conducted on December 14, 2018, with a follow-up contact by the investigator. \nDepartment Counsel advised Applicant in the FORM of her right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 5 as unauthenticated. Department Counsel also informed Applicant \nthat she could, alternatively, provide corrections and updates to the summary of her \ninterview. Department Counsel also warned Applicant that if she failed to object to Item 5 \nor if she failed to respond to the FORM, she may be determined to have waived any \nobjections she has to the admissibility of the interview summary and Item 5 may be \nconsidered as evidence in her case. (FORM at 3.) \n \nApplicant received the FORM on September 18, 2019. She provided no response. \nI conclude that she has waived any objections to the admissibility of Item 5. Accordingly, \nI have included this document in the written record in this case. I have marked Items 1 \nthrough 7 attached to the FORM as Government Exhibit 1-7, respectively. Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me \non November 19, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in her response to the allegations set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d in my findings of fact. I have also noted her explanation in \nmitigation. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 4, her Application, \nunless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM, and the documentary evidence \nin the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 42, is married and has three children, ages 23, 16, and 9. She graduated \nfrom high school and has earned some college credits. Her husband served in the U.S. \nArmy and was discharged between 2015 and 2017. The record is unclear with respect to \nher husband\u2019s post-discharge employment history, except that he was unemployed for a \nperiod. Applicant and her family relocated to another state to live with her parents in about \n2015. Applicant was unemployed for five or six months after the relocation, at which time \nshe obtained a job as a teacher in child-care program. For a period of time in 2017 and \n2018, Applicant also worked at a second job. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant experienced financial distress when she and her husband were \nunemployed and relocated to another state. Also, she reported in her background \ninterview that she experienced deaths in her family; however, she did not provide any \nfurther information about what financial impact, if any, arose from these losses. I note that \nher 2018 Application reflects that both her mother and her father were deceased. \n(Answer; GE 5 at 2.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nVehicle Loan Charged-Off in the Amount of $18,367 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \u2013In March \n2015, Applicant opened an account at a credit union (Credit Union) to purchase a vehicle. \nThe loan amount was $49,368 and the monthly payment was $690. She defaulted on the \nloan in May 2018. Her June 2018 credit report reflects that she also borrowed $31,405 \nfrom a different lender in March 2015 to purchase a second vehicle and that this account \nwas closed following a default. In her background interview, Applicant reported that she \nhad a vehicle repossessed. It is not clear from the record which vehicle was repossessed. \nHer June 12, 2019 credit report in the record reflects that the credit union account has a \nbalance of $18,367. In her Answer, Applicant claimed, \u201cI\u2019m currently working on resolving \nall the incurred debts listed [in the SOR.]\u201d She has provided no additional details or \ndocumentary evidence to show that she has taken any steps to pay this debt or any of \nthe others alleged in the SOR. (GE 5 at 1; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nCredit-Card Debt Charged-Off by the Credit Union in the Amount of $9,182 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) \u2013 Applicant opened this credit-card account in September 2016. She \ndefaulted on the account in about November 2017. In her background interview and in \nher SOR answer, she provided no additional information. (GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nCredit-Card Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $1,852 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \u2013 \nApplicant defaulted on this credit-card account in about February 2017. The record \ncontains no additional information. (GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nBank-Loan Account in Collection in the Amount of $988 (SOR \u00b61.d) \u2013 \nApplicant defaulted on this account in about November 2016. The record contains no \nadditional information. (GE 6 at 7; GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant reported in her background interview that she has received no financial \ncounseling. She provided no additional information about financial counseling in her SOR \nanswer. (GE 5 at 3.) \n \nPolicies \n \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense, dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) before \nany final unfavorable determination may be made. This case is adjudicated under the \nDirective and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017. \nThe ultimate standard is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \n\n4 \n \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n \nA person granted access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Adjudication decisions on applications for a position of public trust include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer and the documentary evidence in the record \nestablish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four debts remain delinquent. They arise out of a period of \nunemployment experienced by her husband after his discharge from the Army, her \nunemployment in 2015 after she relocated her family to live with her parents, and one or \nmore deaths in her family. These circumstances are unusual and may not recur. The fact \nthat the debts have not been addressed either before the SOR or after raises concerns \nabout her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is only partially \nestablished.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes her indebtedness to her husband\u2019s unemployment, her \nunemployment, and other very unfortunate family circumstances, all beyond her control. \nShe has provided, however, no details about the length of the period of her husband\u2019s \nunemployment or how the deaths in her family affected her financial circumstances. \nAbsent more information, it is not possible to make any conclusions regarding the extent \nto which these difficult circumstances may have caused her to experience financial \ndistress. Similarly, she has provided no information upon which a conclusion is possible \nthat she has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially \nestablished. \n \n \nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. She \nhas not provided any evidence of payments of her debts or a record of payments under \ninstallment agreements. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established.  \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. Applicant had an opportunity to respond to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM and \nthe documentary evidence submitted, but she failed to do so. As a result there is \ninsufficient mitigating evidence in the record to explain the extent of her husband\u2019s \nunemployment and its impact of her ability to continue to pay her debts. She relocated \nher family to live with her parents, which likely reduced her living expenses. She was also \nunemployed for a period following her relocation. There is insufficient evidence in the \nrecord to explain how these situations impacted her ability to pay her debts. The same \napplies with respect to her statement that she experienced deaths in her family. She did \nnot explain further whether it was her parents who passed away. If it was her parents who \ndied during the relevant time period, Applicant failed to explain what impact that \nunfortunate situation may have had on her ability to pay her debts. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating the very limited \nevidence in the record in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust. Eligibility for a \nposition of public trust is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",
