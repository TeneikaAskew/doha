Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owed more than $17,000 in four reported delinquent debts in March\n2008. At least one of these debts, for $6,272, remains unresolved and insufficient\ninformation was provided about the circumstances of any of them to mitigate security\nconcerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on June\n25, 2007. On October 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n1\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 26, 2009\n\nItem 3.\n2\nThe Government submitted nine items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4 at 1-11.\n4\nItem 3.\n5\nItem 7.\n6\nItem 3.\n7\nItem 8 at 2.\n8\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 8, 2008, and requested that\nhis case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 9, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non February 3, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He did not submit any material in\nrefutation, extenuation or mitigation, and made no objection to consideration of any\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel. I received the case assignment on April\n15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married, with\nno children, and has been continuously employed since at least 1999. He retired in\n1997 after 20 years of enlisted service in the Army, but never held a security clearance.4\nIn his response to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c,\nand admitted the truth of SOR \u00b6 1.d.  He stated, \u201cI admit that my previous financial\n5\nsituation caused me to default of previous financial obligations.\u201d He did not elaborate\nfurther concerning that situation, however. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those\ncontained in his response to interrogatories,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n6\nApplicant admits owing $6,272 to a large vacation ownership and resort\ncompany. This debt became delinquent in April 2002. In December 2008, he said he\nwas \u201cin the process of attempting to settle this situation.\u201d  He provided no information\n7\nconcerning the origin of the debt or his reason for non-payment. This is the only one of\nthe four delinquencies alleged in the SOR to appear on his most recent record credit\nbureau report (CBR).8\nApplicant claimed that the $5,838 delinquent credit card debt in collections\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, was settled on July 6, 2006, with an agreed payment of $3,882.\nHe provided a poor copy of a bank statement showing issuance of a check from an\n\nItem 3 at 1, 6; Item 5 at 4, 7, 10; Item 6 at 4, 5, 8; Item 8. \n9\nItem 3 at 1, 5; Item 5 at 13; Item 6 at 10; Item 8.\n10\nItem 7 at 5.\n11\n3\nunidentified account in that amount on July 5, 2006. The payee was not identified on the\nstatement. He said he never received a receipt or other correspondence reflecting the\npaid status of the account. The CBRs from July 2007 and March 2008 show that this\naccount was placed with the SOR-alleged collection agency in February 2007, well after\nhis reported settlement with the previous collection agency. The account numbers cited\nby Applicant do not match those in the two CBRs, although there were other accounts\nlisted with the previous creditors on each CBR that reflect zero balances due to transfer\nof the accounts to other creditors. This debt was reported by Experian on the two earlier\nCBRs, but does not appear on the more recent October 2008 Equifax CBR. Applicant\nprovided no explanation concerning the origin of this debt or why it became delinquent.  \n9\nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a different delinquent credit card debt in collections in the\namount of $5,025 that remained unpaid as of March 12, 2008. Although Applicant\nformally denied this, he implicitly admitted it by explaining that he had settled the debt\nfor a payment of $3,582 to a different debt collector in November 2008. The letter he\nprovided to document this payment did involve the same type of credit card, but the\naccount number does not match those cited in the CBRs. This debt was reported by\nTrans Union on the two earlier CBRs, but does not appear on his October 3, 2008,\nEquifax CBR despite the fact that the submitted letter reflects payment did not take\nplace until November 12, 2008. Again, Applicant provided no explanation concerning\nthe circumstances surrounding this delinquency.10\nApplicant also denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, that alleged a $101 delinquent debt resulting\nfrom a returned check dating to June 2002. He said he does not recognize this debt or\nknow how it arose. It was reported by Equifax on his first two record CBRs, but does not\nappear on the latest Equifax report. The record contains no further information\nconcerning this debt.  \nApplicant offered no evidence of credit or financial counseling. He submitted a\nPersonal Financial Statement in August 2008 that showed $11,334 in monthly income\nand $4,442 in total monthly expenses and debt payments, for a net monthly surplus of\n$6,892. It also reflects $10,000 in bank savings.  Applicant offered no explanation for\n11\nhis delinquent debts in light of this apparent financial ability to resolve them. Applicant\noffered no other evidence concerning his character, trustworthiness or responsibility. I\nwas unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor or character in person since he elected\nto have his case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \n\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d are potentially disqualifying. As recently as March 2008,\nApplicant\u2019s CBR reflected $17,236 in delinquent debt. He claimed one of those debts\nhad been settled in July 2006, some seven months before it was reportedly placed for\ncollection with the current creditor, but did not corroborate that claim with credible\nevidence. He also claimed to have settled another of the debts in November 2008, but\nwithout explanation for why it became delinquent. Neither of these two debts appears\non his October 2008 Equifax CBR, but both were reported by different services on the\nearlier reports so that fact is not dispositive. The $101 returned check debt, formerly\nreported by Equifax, disappeared from his most recent report so its validity is not\nestablished at this stage. The existence of more than $17,000 in delinquencies in March\n2008, some dating back to 2002, is sufficient to raise both of these disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing of resulting security concerns\nwith any potentially mitigating matters, and shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility is both long-standing and continues to date. Although he reportedly has\nsubstantial excess monthly income, he did not demonstrate that delinquent\nindebtedness is unlikely to recur, since some delinquent debt remains and casts\ncontinuing doubt on his trustworthiness. The evidence does not support application of\nthis potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant did not\ndemonstrate that any of his delinquent debt arose from circumstances that were beyond\nhis control. The one he admits still owing was for some type of vacation resort\narrangement. The other two major delinquencies were for credit cards, and the reasons\nfor the underlying charges or why he did not pay them in a timely fashion were not\nprovided. Applicant has not established mitigation of any of his debts under this\nprovision.\n\n6\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). This mitigating condition was not asserted by\nApplicant and there is no evidence to support it in this record. Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d)\napplies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant submitted insufficient evidence\nto carry his burden of proof in support of his claim to have resolved the credit card debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and provided no evidence of progress toward resolving\nhis $6,272 debt that has been delinquent since 2002. It may be the case that some\nmitigation would be established by his recent efforts to resolve his delinquencies, but\neven if his claims are accepted, insufficient time and responsible performance has\noccurred to date to alleviate the substantial security concerns raised by the length and\ndegree of financial irresponsibility that continues in part to date. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He presently has at least $6,272 in\ndelinquent debt, and did not meet his burden to prove resolution of $10,863 in\ndelinquent credit card debt. None of his debt was shown to have arisen for reasons\nbeyond his control. \nApplicant has the apparent present ability to resolve financial delinquencies, but\noffered no explanation for not having done so. His debts continue to create substantial\npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress. He provided no information to indicate that\ncontinuation or recurrence of financial problems could be considered unlikely. The\n\n7\nrecord contains insufficient other evidence about his character or responsibility to\nmitigate these concerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of not meeting\nhis financial obligations and inability or unwillingness to satisfy his current debts. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n \n \n \n\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \n \n \n \n\nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has 21 accounts placed for collection totaling in excess of $23,000. \nTen of Applicant\u2019s debts were under $250 each. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nIn December 2003 Applicant moved to Puerto Rico. After moving there she did \nnot pay attention to her credit, made no payments on any of her debts, and did not \ninform her creditors of her new location. At the time, she had 19 credit cards in addition \nto unpaid utility bills. She has paid none of her debts. She hired a credit consultant to \nhelp restore her credit. Her credit scores improved from 572, 554, and 532 in \nSeptember 2008 to 678, 640, and 640 in November 2008. Six of the SOR debts were \ndeleted from Applicant\u2019s November 2008 CBR. (Ex. F) However, Applicant admitted in \nher answer to the SOR owing five of the deleted debts: (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($1,271), 1.h \n \n \n \n\n($1,271), 1.l ($479), 1.m ($244), and 1.n. ($485) In December 2008, her credit allowed \nher to purchase a home.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant had 19 credit card accounts when she left \nthe country in 2003. She has not paid any of her debts. The behavior is recent and the \naccounts numerous. There is nothing in the record supporting her behavior is unlikely to \nrecur except that she has purchased a home and her current mortgage payment, utility \npayments, and two credit cards are current. Leaving the country and not paying her bills \ndoes cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAG & 20(b) does not apply. Her financial problems were not caused by factors \nbeyond her control and she has not acted responsibility under the circumstances. Hiring \na consultant to restore her credit is not the same as paying her past due obligations.  \n \nAG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply. Applicant has paid none of the debts listed \nin the SOR even though ten of them are under $250 each. She has not attended \nfinancial classes. \n \nAG & 20(e) does not apply. Applicant asserts she did not have service with a few \nof the creditors. But she has contacted none of the creditors to challenge the debts. AG \n& 20(e) requires documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue, which Applicant failed to provide.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred numerous credit \ncard obligations and then failed to pay them when she left the country. She\u2019s been \nemployed in her current job since February 2008 and has made no payments on her \naccounts placed for collection.  \n \n \n \n\n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.u: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 4, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 2, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey\nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant had failed to meet her burden of persuasion as to mitigation was erroneous.  Finding no\nerror, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 43-year-old Office\nAdministrator for a defense contractor.  She holds a B.A. degree in business administration.\nApplicant has delinquent debt of approximately $21,000.  She has experienced job layoffs in the past\nand, at the close of the record, was going through a divorce.  In her current job, Applicant brings\nhome around $620 per week.  She advised the Judge that, once the divorce court awards her child\nsupport from her spouse, she will be able to devote more of her take-home pay to addressing her\ndebts.  After the hearing, but before the close of the record, Applicant submitted an exhibit\ndemonstrating that she had hired a credit counseling service to assist her with her debts.  Applicant\u2019s\nreferences describe her as hardworking, trustworthy, and of good character.   \nApplicant appears to challenge the weight which the Judge assigned her mitigating evidence\nconcerning her divorce, unemployment, and efforts to obtain credit counseling.  However, a party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions ins a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  For example, Applicant\u2019s having sought credit\ncounseling following the hearing is entitled to less weight than would a demonstrated history of debt\nrepayment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13041 (App. Bd.

On September 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 29, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on October 16, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October\n30, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 10, 2008.  The Government offered five\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant offered nine exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I\nand testified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on\nJanuary 31, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  Applicant\nsubmitted three Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits A, B and C.\nThe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on December 19, 2008.  Based upon a\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Business\nAdministration.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an Office Administrator\nand is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof  having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant is indebted to at least eleven separate creditors totaling\napproximately $21,000.00.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5).  Applicant\nexplained that she is currently going through a divorce and has three children in her\ncustody.  She and her husband have been separated for four years, and he provides no\nchild support.  Each of the debts listed in the SOR, except one, was acquired by her\nand/or her husband during the course of their marriage.  She is uncertain how the court\nwill divide the joint debts, but assumes that she will be responsible for at least half of\nthem. Some of the debts listed in the SOR are for credit cards used for household\nexpenses, others are medical bills for her or her children.  Her husband currently pays\nhalf of the house payment and nothing more toward the household expenses.  \nApplicant\u2019s child custody and child support hearing was scheduled in superior\ncourt on November 5, 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  Applicant is seeking support in the\namount of approximately $1,100.00 per month.  If awarded, the child support award will\nbe used to assist with the children while her other income will go towards paying off her\ndelinquent debts.  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B indicates that her child custody\nand child support hearing was continued until February 24, 2008.  \nApplicant began working for her current employer in January 2008.  She earns\n$18.25 per hour and brings home approximately $623.00 per week.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits F and G).  This money she uses to pay her half of the mortgage and to support\nher children.  One of her children is in Catholic school, and the Applicant\u2019s mother is\nassisting her with tuition.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).   \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s Post Hearing Exhibit C indicates that on January 20, 2009, the\nApplicant retained a credit counseling service to repair and remove derogatory credit\nentries on her credit report and to assist her in resolving her outstanding debt.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s Performance Evaluation for the period from January 2008 and\nDecember 2008 is favorable.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).\nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Manager dated December 8,\n2008, and from her Supervisor dated December 4, 2008, attests to her honesty,\nintegrity, good character and judgment and her persistent pursuit of excellence.  She is\nknown as a hard worker and a leader, who demonstrates excellent communication skills\nand the willingness to face challenges head on with efficiency.  She is highly\nrecommended for a position of trust, as she is considered to be a valuable asset to the\ncompany.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n\n4\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Unfortunately, the Applicant is excessively indebted as a result of\na divorce and an irresponsible husband.  She is supporting herself and her three\nchildren by herself.  Under the circumstances, she has been unable to pay her\ndelinquent debts.  She recently contacted a consumer credit counselor to assist her in\ncleaning up her credit report and resolving her past due indebtedness.  She\nunderstands the importance of paying her bills on time and living within her means.\nHowever, until her financial situation is addressed, there is no evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  Thus, at this time she has not demonstrated that she can properly handle\nher financial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ration, and/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances also applies.  Even so, she does not meet the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  She remains excessively indebted.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \n\n6\n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The facts of this case are unusual and\nunfortunate.  However, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines\nviewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness,  unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nand/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.  The Applicant\u2019s situation prevents her from meeting the eligibility\nrequirements.  She has not paid any of her outstanding debts.  This Applicant may\nreapply for a security clearance in the future when she is eligible and when she has\naddressed her financial indebtedness. At the present time, however, applying the\nguidelines of the Directive, she is not security clearance worthy.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not mitigate the\nnegative effects of her financial indebtedness and the effects that it can have on her\nability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n7\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 34 years old and engaged to be married. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Program Manager, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with her employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she abuses illegal drugs. Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because the Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The Applicant obtained her Bachelors Degree in December 1997, and her Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering in May 2000. While in graduate school, she used marijuana about ten times, between 1998 to 1999. She also used LSD on two occasions between August 1999 and October 1999, and used cocaine on two occasions between October 1998 and November 1998. She used these illegal drugs at outdoor festivals, concerts, camping trips and in Europe. She has worked in a DoD related program as either an apprentice, or on a part or full time basis, since high school. She obtained a DoD security clearance in 1998.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Thomas A. Kruza III, Attorney At Law\nJune 8, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on February 7, 2008.  On October 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines H and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 16, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on March 3, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 11,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for April 2, 2009.  The Government offered two exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered twenty-nine exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through CC.\nShe also testified on her own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on\nApril 16, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of United States\nCode, Title 21, Sections 802 and 812 which define the Controlled Substance Act.\nApplicant had no objection.  (Tr. p. 40).  The request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence, but were included in the record. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 34 years old and engaged to be married.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor as a Program Manager, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with her employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she abuses illegal drugs.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because the Applicant engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations that raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe Applicant obtained her Bachelors Degree in December 1997, and her\nMasters Degree in Mechanical Engineering in May 2000.  While in graduate school, she\nused marijuana about ten times, between 1998 to 1999.  She also used LSD on two\noccasions between August 1999 and October 1999, and used cocaine on two\noccasions between October 1998 and November 1998.  She used these illegal drugs at\noutdoor festivals, concerts, camping trips and in Europe.  She has worked in a DoD\nrelated program as either an apprentice, or on a part or full time basis, since high\nschool.  She obtained a DoD security clearance in 1998.    \nIn 2003, while traveling in Amsterdam with her fiance, she used marijuana three\ntimes.  She also used it on one occasion in 2006, while attending a gathering with\ngraduate student friends.    \nShe began working for her current employer in September 2005.  Although the\nApplicant realized that the use of illegal drugs was prohibited by law and was against\nDoD policy, she used illegal drugs anyway.  She testified that her illegal drug use was a\nstupid mistake that will never be repeated.  She now fully understands her\nresponsibilities while holding a security clearance, and how serious it is to the DoD.\nShe has not used any illegal drug for the past three years, since her last marijuana use\nin 2006, and she has no intention of ever using any illegal drug in the future.  (Tr. pp.\n59, 66-67, 70 -71, 74 -75 ).   \nSince her last use of marijuana in 2006, the Applicant has redirected her life.\nShe no longer associates with any of her friends from graduate school or anyone else\nwho uses illegal drugs.  She realizes that her earlier drug use was stupid and that it has\n\n3\nno place in her life.  She also realizes the enormous responsibilities that come with\nholding a security clearance.  She understands that illegal drug use is not only against\nthe law but against defense industry policy.  She states that she will never use any\nillegal drug in the future and is confident that she will not.  She has signed a statement\nof intent on March 19, 2009, indicating that if she is ever to use any illegal drug in the\nfuture, her security clearance will be immediately revoked.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and\nTr. pp. 65-66).     \nThe Applicant now lives with her fianc\u00e9, who does not use illegal drugs, other\nthan a one time marijuana use in Amsterdam.  They are planning to get married this\nspring.  They have purchased a house together and they plan to have children after\nthey are married.  When she is not working, as a stress release the Applicant enjoys\nexercising and playing with her pets.    \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor, professional colleagues\nand friends indicate that they have never observed the Applicant using any illegal drugs\nor exhibiting the effects of illegal drug use.  In fact most of them never heard about or\neven pondered the possibility of the Applicant or her fianc\u00e9 ever using illegal drugs until\nthey were informed of her hearing before DOHA.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G through P). \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for 2007 and 2009 reflect excellent\nratings, her work quality is outstanding, her communication skills are effective, and her\nwork is flawless.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C).  Applicant received a promotion\ndated December 31, 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  Applicant has received several\nawards in recognition of her excellence in service. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit T).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25. (a) any drug abuse;\n25. (b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\n25. (g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\n\n4\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.  (b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n26. (b).(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n26. (b).(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n26. (b).(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n17(d). The individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthiness, unreliability or other inappropriate behavior, and\nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur;\n17. (e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation or duress.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n\n5\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d             \n                                   \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and personal conduct that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\n\n6\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant\n(Guideline E).  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H and E of the SOR.  I have considered all of the\nevidence presented in this case, including the letters of recommendation, the favorable\nperformance evaluations and recent promotion and the other accomplishments of the\nApplicant.  The Applicant used illegal drugs including marijuana, LSD and cocaine for\nthe most part in graduate school.  This was a stupid and childish thing to do.  Since\n2006, she has not used any illegal drugs and has no intentions of ever using any illegal\ndrug again.  She is ashamed and remorseful for her misconduct in the past.  She has\nmatured since graduate school, and no longer associates with illegal drug users.  She\nhas signed a statement of intent indicating that she will not use illegal drugs in the future\nand if she does, her security clearance will be immediately revoked.  This further\ndemonstrates her commitment to a drug free lifestyle.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(b) testing positive for illegal drug use, and 22(g) any illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance apply.  Mitigating Conditions 26.(b) a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: 26.(b).(1) disassociation from drug-\nusing associates and contacts;26.(b).(3) an appropriate period of abstinence, and\n26(b)(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation applies.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions,16(c). credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as\na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information applies.  However, Mitigating Conditions, 17(d). the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthiness, unreliability or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur and 17. (e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress also apply.\nConsequently, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 34 years old, highly\neducated, intelligent, successful and a well respected employee of the defense industry\n\n7\nwho has held a security clearance for over ten years.  She has stopped using illegal\ndrugs, recently been promoted on the job, is getting married and starting a family soon.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth above, when\nviewed under all of the guidelines as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\ngood judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, a willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may  properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and that she meets the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information at this time.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence\nsupports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations\nexpressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.                                                                   \n                                                     \n  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has more than $50,000 in delinquent debt. She is close to bringing her\nstudent loan debt into a current status, but has insufficient income to address more than\n$9,000 in other delinquencies she incurred since her 1999 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86), on\nJanuary 29, 2008. On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n1\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nFebruary 17, 2009\n\nItems 3 and 4.\n2\nThe Government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 3.\n4\nItem 8.\n5\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 27, 2008, and November 30,\n2008, and requested that her case be decided by an administrative judge on the written\nrecord without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written\n2\ncase on December 19, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)3\nwas provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM\non January 4, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. She provided her timely written response\nto the FORM with additional evidence on January 16, 2009, and made no objection to\nconsideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. On January 22, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel indicated that he had no objection to admission and consideration\nof any materials submitted by Applicant in response to the FORM. I received the case\nassignment on January 29, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. In her\nresponse to the SOR, she admitted all the factual allegations in SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.i.  These two allegations represented multiple listings of the same debt, and were\n4\nwithdrawn by Department Counsel in the FORM. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including\nthose contained in her response to interrogatories,  are incorporated in the following\n5\nfindings.\nApplicant filed for and received Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in 1999. It is not clear\nfrom the record what, if any, employment she has held since then. She has lived with\nher mother for the last three years to reduce living expenses, has been divorced for 25\nyears, and has two adult sons. She was awarded a Master of Science degree in\nManagement from National Louis University in August 1995. \nApplicant presently owes $46,851 on the SOR \u00b6 1.a student loan debt that is in\ncollection. This total includes a $9,171 penalty that will be removed if she brings the\nloan current under her present nine-month loan rehabilitation program. She started\nmaking payments under the program in July 2007, but did not complete it after paying\nfor several months. She began the rehabilitation program again in June 2008. She\nmade the first seven payments, through December 2008, and accepted the collection\nagency\u2019s offer to reduce the final two months\u2019 payments from $350 to $330 each. If she\nmakes the final two rehabilitation payments, the debt will be about $37,000 after\nremoval of the penalty. \n\n3\nApplicant also has six other delinquent debts that have been placed for\ncollection, as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f through 1.h, and 1.j. These debts range from\n$54 to $5,147, and total $6,682. She also owes the $2,500 judgment debt, listed in SOR\n\u00b6 1.e, that resulted from the voluntary repossession of an automobile she returned to\nthe dealer because of a mold problem. These debts became delinquent between 2002\nand 2008. One debt is a medical account, but the rest are consumer debts and\nApplicant provided no evidence that any of them were unavoidable.\nApplicant consulted a credit counseling service in October 2008. Together, they\nprepared a budget and a proposed 35-month debt management plan to address her\nnon-student-loan debts, that she submitted with her response to the SOR. Her budget\nshowed monthly income of $977 and budgeted expenses (including student loan\npayments) of $937. Adding the recommended $327 in monthly debt management plan\npayments resulted in a net negative monthly cash flow of $287. She noted that she was\nseeking additional employment to increase her income, but offered no evidence of\nsuccess in this regard, or of having made any debt management plan payments.  \nApplicant offered no other evidence concerning her character, trustworthiness or\nresponsibility. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor or character in person\nsince she elected to have her case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d are potentially disqualifying. After paying very modest\nliving expenses, Applicant\u2019s budget reflects only $40 per month available to apply\ntoward about $9,200 in delinquent non-student-loan debts. Repayment at that rate,\nexcluding any additional interest, would take more than 19 years. Her recent history of\nnot repaying debts dates back to 2002, shortly after her Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nextinguished earlier debt in 1999. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing of resulting\nsecurity concerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and shifting the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\n\n5\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility is both long-standing and continues to date. Although she obtained a\nMaster of Science in Management degree over 13 years ago, she demonstrated no\nability to secure employment that would support ongoing living expenses and permit\ndebt repayment. She did not demonstrate that delinquent indebtedness is unlikely to\nrecur, since some delinquencies are recent and cast continuing doubt on her\ntrustworthiness. The evidence does not support application of this potentially mitigating\ncondition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant did not\ndemonstrate that her small monthly income is beyond her control. Her divorce was 25\nyears ago and, in any event, her Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in 1999 would have\nresolved any lingering debt issues resulting from that. She provided no evidence of any\nmedical emergencies or unavoidable job loss. She attributed the repossession leading\nto her $2,500 judgment debt to a mold problem, but did not explain why that\nnecessitated turning the car in instead of having it repaired. Applicant has not\nestablished mitigation of any of her debts under this provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). This mitigating condition is partly raised by\nApplicant\u2019s October 2008 credit counseling and resulting budget and debt management\nplan. However, she did not demonstrate having made any payments under the plan,\nand her budget reflected her inability to make anything close to the payments required\nunder the plan. Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nApplicant made seven of nine required payments in her second attempt to complete a\nstudent loan rehabilitation agreement. Two more payments will remove over $9,000 in\npenalties and bring the loans into a current status. However, she will still owe over\n$37,000 and, should the monthly payments remain the same at that point, it will take\nabout ten years to repay that. Both of theses potentially mitigating conditions are being\nestablished by her recent efforts to resolve her delinquencies, but insufficient time and\nresponsible performance has occurred to date to alleviate the substantial security\nconcerns raised by the length and degree of financial irresponsibility that created her\npresent situation. \n\u201cAn applicant is not required to show that she has completely paid off her\nindebtedness, only that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and\nhas \u2018taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2\n\n6\n(App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6,\n2006)). It cannot yet be said that Applicant has taken significant actions to implement a\nreasonable plan concerning her more than $9,000 in delinquent non-student-loan debts.\nHer income is insufficient, by about 30%, to make the recommended payments for the\n35-month repayment plan, and she has not made any payments toward that plan. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her choices and conduct. She presently has more than $50,000 in\ndelinquent debt, interest charges and penalties. None of her debt arose for reasons\nbeyond her control. Some of the delinquencies are recent, and all are ongoing.\nRehabilitating her student loan debt will not end her obligation to repay it, but will just\nbring the debt into a current status and remove $9,171 in penalties. \nApplicant has not obtained additional or better employment to improve her\npresent annual income of $11,724. Her debts continue to create substantial potential for\npressure, coercion, or duress. She provided no information to indicate her financial\nsituation will improve to the point that continuation or recurrence of financial problems\ncould be considered unlikely. The record contains insufficient other evidence about her\ncharacter or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to make their\ncontinuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her history of not meeting\nher  financial obligations and inability to satisfy her current debts. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nWithdrawn by Dept.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant is indebted to various creditors in the amount of approximately $29,000.00. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 2 and 4).

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 2, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 11, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On August 28, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 3, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on October 29, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October\n31, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 9, 2008.  The Government offered five\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant offered one exhibit, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and testified\non his own behalf.  The record was left open until close of business on January 9, 2009,\nto allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The\nApplicant submitted four documents referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1\nthrough 4 that were admitted into evidence without objection.  The transcript of the\n\n2\nhearing (Tr.) was received on December 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 54 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nTech-3 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant is indebted to various creditors in the amount of approximately\n$29,000.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 2 and 4).  He admits all of the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, except allegations 1(d), 1(f), 1(g), 1(h) and 1(i).  He denies these debts\nbecause he believes that his accidental insurance should have paid them.  He\nsubmitted no documentary evidence to support this assertion. \nPrior to 2004, the Applicant\u2019s job required that he travel frequently.  His wife\nhandled all of the finances.  In November 2004, the Applicant filed for divorce and\nmoved out of the house.  His wife was suffering from severe emotional problems from\nprescription drugs she was taking.  The Applicant was not aware that she was not filing\ntheir income tax returns.  The divorce is not yet final due to their tax issues.  (Tr. p. 43).  \nFrom 2004 to sometime in 2007, the Applicant, who is a General Contractor, had\nhis own construction and remodeling business.  He obtained a business loan and used\ncredit cards to help finance the business.  His business was not successful, and in\n2005, he started having difficulty paying his bills.  \nTo further complicate matters, in November 2006, the Applicant was riding his\nmotorcycle in the desert and hit a rock that threw him from the bike.  He landed on his\nhead and cracked his vertebra.  He was out of work for four months.  Although he had\nmedical insurance, it only paid some of his bills, the others became delinquent and were\neventually sent to collection.  He returned to work but in May 2007, he tripped on a\nfireplace hearth while carrying some equipment and broke his wrist.  \nThe following debts became delinquent; a state tax lien in the amount of\n$8,118.00.  (Government Exhibit 3).  This debt is currently being paid through voluntary\ngarnishment in the amount of $235.00 per pay period.  Applicant expects the debt to be\npaid off by the end of 2009.  A business loan in the amount of $12,409.00 was being\n\n3\npaid until the Applicant\u2019s accident.  Since then, the Applicant has contacted the creditor\nbut has not set up a payment plan.  A credit card debt owed to CAP ONE in the amount\nof $4,409.00 remains outstanding.  A medical bill owed to CMRE FINANCIAL in the\namount of $304.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to LOWES in the amount of\n$779.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to MERVYNS in the amount of $20.00 has\nbeen paid.  A medical bill owed to GRANT & WEBER in the amount of $365.00 remains\noutstanding.  A medical bill owed to JJMAC/LATITU in the amount of $1,647.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to Sears and transferred to LVNV FUNDING in the amount of\n$1,232.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to VERIZON in the amount of $156.00\nremains outstanding.\nIn December 2007, the Applicant started working for his current employer.  From\nthe DoD investigation concerning his security clearance, he learned that his income tax\nreturns for the past five years had not been filed.  In July 2008, he hired a tax attorney\nand he has filed two of the five returns.  His attorney is currently working on his 2002,\n2004 and 2005 income tax returns.        \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Supervisor, Project Lead, team\nmember and a long time friend attest to the Applicant\u2019s dependability, reliability,\nmeticulous nature and trustworthiness.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n\n4\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n5\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Admittedly, a series of unfortunate circumstances caused the\nApplicant\u2019s financial demise.  His divorce, his failed business, and two accidents all\ncontributed to his financial problems.  However, since December 2007, he has been\nworking full time and at times overtime for his current employer, and has only paid off\none of his debts, a debt for $20.00.  He is making payments on the tax lien, but the\nother debts remain outstanding and are substantial.  In fact, the Applicant owes at least\n$20,000.00 in debt, possibly more.  Under the circumstances, he has not made a good\nfaith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is insufficient evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  The Applicant has not demonstrated that he can properly handle his\nfinancial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Condition 20.(b) the conditions that\n\n6\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances also\napplies.  However, even so, he has not shown sufficient good judgment since the\nunfortunate circumstances to meet security clearance eligibility requirements.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\n    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of his financial indebtedness and its impact on his\nability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n7\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn March 28, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions\n(SF 86) to obtain a security clearance required for her job with a defense contractor, for\nwhom she works as a truck driver. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant written interrogatories  regarding adverse financial information in her\n1\nbackground. After Applicant responded to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were\nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the\n2\nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On October 24,\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included ten documents (Items 1 - 10) proffered in\n4\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n3\nGuideline F (financial considerations). Applicant timely responded to the SOR and\nrequested a decision without a hearing. On January 16, 2009, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s\n4\npreliminary decision. Applicant received the FORM on February 1, 2009, and timely\nresponded to it. The case was assigned to me on February 20, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in August 2008, and that they disclosed liabilities in their petition of\napproximately $428,583. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant admitted the allegation without\nexplanation. (Items 1 and 3) In addition to the facts entered in the record through\nApplicant\u2019s admission, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 61-year-old truck driver for a company doing business with the\nDepartment of Defense. She has held this job since March 2008, but was employed as\na driver with another company from August 1997 until March 2008. (FORM, Item 7)\nWhen Applicant submitted her application for a security clearance, she listed seven\ndelinquent credit card accounts totaling approximately $115,973. (FORM, Item 7) Credit\nbureau reports obtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation (FORM, Items 9\nand 10) revealed additional delinquent accounts, most of which were opened between\n2003 and 2007. Most of her accounts have become past due or delinquent since 2007.\nThe same documents also show Applicant has remained current on other accounts\nsuch as her mortgage and car payments.\nIn response to written interrogatories about her debts, she submitted a copy of a\nrecent pay stub, and a personal financial statement (PFS) showing a net monthly\nremainder after expenses of about $1,861. She also submitted a copy of the Chapter 7\nbankruptcy petition she and her husband filed on August 22, 2008. In that petition, they\ndeclared $428,583.79 in liabilities against $254,615 in assets. (FORM, Item 8) It\nappears from a review of information in the bankruptcy petition, which lists a trade or\nbusiness name along with certain types of personal property used as collateral for\ncreditors\u2019 secured claims, that Applicant and her husband may have been in business\nfor themselves recently. However, it is unclear how, if at all, any of the unpaid debts\nlisted in Schedules E and F were related to possible business ventures. Further, the\ninformation presented in the petition about their income versus expenses shows that, as\nof the bankruptcy filing, Applicant and her husband actually had a negative monthly\ncashflow. (FORM, Item 8)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n3\nAccording to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator in May 2008. However, there is no information in the record\nabout the results of that interview that may have shed some light on Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances. Nor did Applicant provide any amplifying information with her admission\nto the single SOR allegation. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated only she had\nnothing new to add, that she could not afford an attorney to help her, and that she was\nworking to overcome her financial problems. She also alluded to unspecified bad\nbusiness decisions that (presumably) caused her debts.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a. Further, Applicant admitted the allegation without explanation. The presence of\nrecent unpaid debt and an apparent inability to pay require application of the\ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG\n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Additionally, the sheer volume of\ndebt owed through personal credit card accounts suggests that Applicant may have\nbeen irresponsible in her spending habits. Such would require application of the\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt).\nIn response, Applicant has provided no information that would support\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 20. It would have been\nhelpful to have more investigative information about the origin and/or current status of\nApplicant\u2019s debts. As to her current and future financial prospects, her PFS reflects a\nsignificant positive cash flow each month; however, the bankruptcy petition shows a\nnegative monthly cashflow. Regardless, the government established that Applicant has\nincurred significant unpaid personal debt. This was sufficient to support the\ngovernment\u2019s preliminary decision to deny Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance. Thus,\nthe burden shifted to the Applicant to present sufficient information to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by the facts established through the SOR. Applicant had two\nopportunities to present that information \u2013 when she responded to the SOR and/or\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n5\nwhen she responded to the FORM. Applicant\u2019s resolution of her debts through\nbankruptcy, without more information about, for example, the causes of the  debts, her\ncurrent finances, and the prospects for her finances in the future, is not enough to\novercome the government\u2019s concerns about Applicant\u2019s suitability.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). However, aside from the fact of\nApplicant\u2019s age and personal history, there is no available information aside from the\nfact of her recent financial problems that would support application of any of the whole\nperson factors. As such, significant doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n9\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows she has failed to address\nsatisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant conditions and factors.

Applicant did not provide any exhibits (Tr. \n11). I also admitted the hearing notice (GE 8), the SOR (GE 9), and Applicant\u2019s SOR \nresponse (GE 10). I received the transcript on April 23, 2009.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (GE \n10). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old cost analyst for a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 39, 42).2 \nHe received his high school diploma in 1993 (Tr. 43). He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2004 (Tr. 6, 34). He has earned some credits towards his master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration (MBA) (Tr. 39-40). He is not married (Tr. 41). He held a security \nclearance previously when he was on active duty in the U.S. Marines; however, he does \nnot currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 7). His professional goal is to complete his \nMBA and to become a project manager and then a program manager (Tr. 43).  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines for four and a half years (Tr. 40). He was \nassigned to an elite unit, Force Recon (Tr. 88). In 2002, he received field-grade level \nnonjudicial punishment (NJP) for dereliction of duty because he failed to prevent a \nsubordinate Marine from driving while intoxicated or impaired by alcohol (DUI) (Tr. 89-\n90). Applicant and another vehicle occupant were also intoxicated (Tr. 89). He was \nfound guilty of the offense; however, he did not receive a reduction in grade from the \nNJP (Tr. 90). He left active duty as a Sergeant (Tr. 41). He received several injuries \nwhile on active duty and he decided to leave active duty because he did not believe he \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n2Applicant\u2019s 2008 SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph and the last \nparagraph in this section, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwas medically capable of completing another enlistment (Tr. 21, 90). He did not serve in \ncombat (Tr. 22-23, 89-90). \n \nApplicant has never been charged with any felony, firearms or explosives \noffense(s). He has not been arrested or charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type \noffenses in the last seven years, except for arrests and eventually convictions for \nmarijuana possession in 1995 and for DUI in 2006. In the last seven years, he has not \nhad any debts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy petitions, unpaid judgments, or \nunpaid liens. \n \nIllegal Drug Possession and Sale and Alcohol Abuse \n \n \nFrom about 1993 to about 1998, Applicant sometimes used marijuana on a \nweekly basis and at other times, it was every few months (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 43-47, 79-80; \nGE 10). On August 18, 1995, Applicant was charged with marijuana possession (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c; Tr. 48-49; GE 10). He was convicted of marijuana possession and fined $1,000 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. 48-49; GE 10). He also attended an alcohol/drug safety action program \n(ASAP), which involved attendance at ten weekly classes (Tr. 50). He did not consider \nthe ten classes to be drug therapy or counseling (Tr. 62). He was also required to \nprovide three urine samples for drug testing (Tr. 49). The first two tests were positive for \nthe marijuana metabolite; however, the third urinalysis test was negative for illegal \nsubstances (Tr. 49-50). After completion of his ASAP classes, he returned to using \nmarijuana until he completed college (Tr. 50). He purchased marijuana on several \noccasions with his friends (drug distribution) while he was in college (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 52; \nGE 10). \n \nApplicant did not use marijuana while in the U.S. Marines (Tr. 53, 71). He was \ndrug-tested about five times per year while in the Marines (Tr. 72). About four or five \nmonths after leaving the Marines (around November 2003), he started using marijuana \nagain (Tr. 53). He used marijuana about every three months for the next three years for \na total of about 12 times (time period: November 2003 to December 2006) (SOR \u00b6 1.b; \nTr. 54; GE 10). At least two of his employers during this period when he was using \nmarijuana probably had a policy against use of illegal drugs; however, those two \nemployers did not engage in random drug testing although he may have had an initial \ndrug test at the start of the employment (Tr. 66-68).  \n \nOn November 17, 2006, Applicant submitted his application for a security \nclearance (Tr. 55). Two days later, Applicant was arrested for DUI (Tr. 55; SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nHe pleaded guilty and was convicted (Tr. 74). He was sentenced to 180 days in jail with \n175 days suspended (Tr. 74). He received a $500 fine and court costs (Tr. 74). He \nattended ASAP classes again as part of his DUI sentence (Tr. 63; GE 2 at 3). His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for about a year (Tr. 74; GE 5). He completed six \nmonths with an alcohol interlock device in his car (Tr. 75-76; GE 5). He attended 20 \nhours of private, alcohol counseling (Tr. 18; GE 2 at 3). He attended two Alcoholics \nAnonymous sessions (GE 2 at 3). He has continued to consume alcohol; however, he \nhas not been drunk on alcohol since his DUI, except for New Year\u2019s Day in 2007 (Tr. \n18, 80; GE 2 at 3; GE 3; GE 4).  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s interim Secret security clearance was approved on November 27, \n2006, and he used marijuana twice in December 2006 after his security clearance was \ngranted (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.b; Tr. 56, 65; GE 10). He does not currently associate with \nthe person(s) that provided the marijuana to him from November 2003 to December \n2006, or any other known drug users (Tr. 56-58). Applicant\u2019s employer has not used \nurinalysis tests to verify whether or not Applicant has used illegal drugs since December \n2006 (Tr. 66).  \n \n \nOn February 10, 2007, Applicant received a citation for walking his dog without \nhaving it on a leash (SOR \u00b6 2.d; Tr. 83-84). His dog was not acting aggressively \ntowards others or breaching the peace (Tr. 83-84). This citation is too insignificant to \nconstitute a security concern. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he has not used marijuana since December 2006, \nand he did not intend to use marijuana in the future (Tr. 85, 87-88). He does not \ncurrently attend any Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings (Tr. 85).  \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Applications \n \nOn November 17, 2006, Applicant signed his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Tr. 59-60; GE \n1). On his November 17, 2006 SF 86 he responded, \u201cNo\u201d to Section 24a, which asks: \n \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\u2014Illegal Use of Drugs \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?    \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to Section 24a on his November 17, 2006 SF 86 was \ndeliberately false. He provided misleading information about his marijuana use because \nhe was worried about keeping his employment (Tr. 60). He thought if he was truthful he \nwould not receive a security clearance and consequently would lose his job (Tr. 61).3  \n \nOn February 12, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nquestioned Applicant about his marijuana use. Applicant did not accurately disclose his \nmost recent marijuana use to the OPM investigator. Applicant falsely stated that his \nmost recent marijuana use was in early 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.e).  \n \nOn November 1, 2007, in response to two DOHA interrogatories about his most \nrecent marijuana use, Applicant said he, \u201cused experimentally in college,\u201d and it had \n \n3Applicant did not disclose his 1995 attendance at ASAP or his 1995 marijuana possession \nconviction on his 2006 SF 86 (Tr. 63-65). The SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to disclose this \ninformation. Applicant did not disclose the ASAP attendance because he did not believe it to be therapy \nor counseling, and he thought there was a seven-year time limit to the requirement to disclose his 1995 \nconviction (Tr. 62-64; GE 3 at 6). He did not think there was a seven-year time limit on disclosing his \nmarijuana use (Tr. 64). \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nbeen \u201cyears, can\u2019t remember\u201d since his last marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 2.f; GE 2 at 5; GE \n10). As indicated previously, he was well aware that his most recent marijuana use was \non two occasions in December 2006. \n \nOn July 1, 2008, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant revealed his \nmarijuana use in December 2006 and admitted he falsified his security clearance \ndocumentation out of a \u201csurvival instinct\u201d (GE 4 at 2-3, 4). However, Applicant was not \ncompletely candid in this statement because he understated his marijuana use in \ncollege, stating his marijuana use was \u201ca few times a year\u201d (GE 4 at 2).  \n \nAt his hearing Applicant emphasized that he was very sorry about lying to the \ngovernment (Tr. 16, 106-107). He lied out of a sense of \u201cself-preservation of [his] job \nand reputation\u201d (Tr. 19). Applicant said he felt deep regret, guilt and shame because of \nhis poor decisions (Tr. 19-21) and he explained: \n \nYou know, I\u2019ve made poor decisions, I know that, but obviously being \ndishonest about those things, you know, one lie begets another, you \nknow, I\u2019ve definitely, I\u2019ve fallen into that bear trap obviously. I obviously \ncan\u2019t argue [with] what\u2019s in black and white in front of me. So there\u2019s no \nquestion about that. \n \n (Tr. 106). Applicant promised to do better in the future (Tr. 107). \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor (S) has known Applicant for about 30 months (Tr. 33-34). \nS is a Captain in the reserves and he has held a clearance for 22 years (Tr. 35). S has \nbeen a unit commander three times (Tr. 35). S described Applicant as a consummate \nprofessional (Tr. 34). Applicant is diligent, reliable, trustworthy and responsible (Tr. 34-\n35). When Applicant had access to classified information, he was very conscientious \n(Tr. 34-35). In October 2007 and February 2009, Applicant was employee of the month \n(Tr. 35). Applicant is an important asset to the Army and the Department of Defense (Tr. \n38). He strongly recommends reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance (Tr. 38). If \nApplicant loses his clearance, his employment will be terminated (Tr. 37).  \n \nApplicant described himself as a very hard worker, trustworthy, honorable, \npatriotic, dedicated and reliable with high integrity (Tr. 17, 26-27). He has a very strong \nwork ethic (Tr. 23). He emphasized his professionalism and his desire to continue to \nassist in the nation\u2019s defense through supporting the Army (Tr. 23). In the last 30 \nmonths, he was only late for work once and that was because he was in a car accident \n(Tr. 23). He was the only employee in an office of 50 persons, who received employee \nof the month twice (Tr. 23). He loves his job (Tr. 23, 26). His positive relationship with \nhis peers at work is also very important to him (Tr. 23). He is a team player. He is very \nproud of his contributions to the United States on active duty and subsequently as a \ngovernment contractor (Tr. 26).  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Four drug involvement disqualifying conditions could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: \u201cany drug \nabuse,\u201d4 \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use,\u201d \u201cillegal drug possession or sale or \ndistribution,\u201d and \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d \n    \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c) and 25(g) apply. The other disqualifying conditions \nlisted in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because \nApplicant used, possessed, and distributed marijuana.5 He fully disclosed his drug \nabuse in his SOR response and at his hearing. He possessed marijuana before he used \n \n4AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. \nRaish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nit. After he was convicted of marijuana possession in 1995, he tested positive for the \npresence of the marijuana metabolite in his urine. Applicant\u2019s interim Secret security \nclearance was approved on November 27, 2006, and he used marijuana twice in \nDecember 2006 after his security clearance was granted.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s extensive marijuana use lasted approximately seven or eight years \n(1993 to 1998 and from November 2003 to December 2006), and involved numerous \nuses of marijuana. However, Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in December 2006, \nabout 26 months prior to his hearing. He recognizes the adverse impact on his life of \ndrug abuse. These actions create some certitude that he will continue to abstain from \ndrug use. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies to his marijuana-related offenses.7    \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using \nassociates and contacts. He has broken his patterns of drug abuse, and he has \nchanged his life with respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug abuse for \nabout 26 months. However, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent with \nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d8 AG \u00b6 26(b) does not fully apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. The \nmarijuana was never prescribed for him. He receives partial credit because he \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n7In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n8Even though he did not provide such a statement, sufficient time has elapsed since his most \nrecent illegal drug use, to warrant full mitigation of security concerns relating to his drug involvement. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nsatisfactorily completed a prescribed drug/alcohol treatment program after his DUI in \n2006; however, he cannot receive full credit because he did not provide \u201ca favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional, including rehabilitation and aftercare \nrequirements.\u201d \n  \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in December 2006, about 26 \nmonths ago. The motivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. He understands the \nadverse results from drug abuse.9 He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track \nrecord of no drug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to \nclassified information.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process \nthe adjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and  \n \n(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty violations.10 \n \n9Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n \n10The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant failed to disclose his marijuana use from November 2003 to December \n2006 on his 2006 SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). On February 12, 2007, he lied to an OPM \ninvestigator, when he failed to disclose that his most recent marijuana was in December \n2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.e). On November 1, 2007, he provided false information in response to \na DOHA interrogatory, when failed to disclose that his most recent marijuana was in \nDecember 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.f). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b) and 16(d)(3) all apply. \n \nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse after being granted a clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.b), 2006 DUI (SOR \u00b6 2.c), and citation for \nwalking a dog not on a leash (SOR \u00b6 2.d), the pertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \n\u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal \nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if \nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \nCertainly, Applicant\u2019s 2006 excessive alcohol consumption-related DUI, criminal \nconduct and marijuana use while holding a security clearance violate important civil and \ncriminal rules in our society, and a history of such problems is conduct a person might \nwish to conceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d \napplies to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after being granted a clearance, 2006 DUI, and \ncitation for walking a dog not on a leash. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and most importantly, \nsecurity officials are well aware of Applicant\u2019s problems. Applicant has taken the \npositive step of disclosure, eliminating any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or \nduress. I do not believe Applicant would compromise national security to avoid public \ndisclosure of these problems. Any personal conduct security concerns pertaining to his \nmarijuana use after being granted a clearance, his 2006 DUI, and his citation for \nwalking a dog not on a leash are dealt with more thoroughly under the specific, pertinent \nguidelines. For example, drug use is best addressed under the drug involvement \nguideline in this decision. The personal conduct concerns related to his problems are \nwell known to the government.   \n \nApplicant deserves substantial credit in the whole person analysis for candidly \nadmitting he falsified these documents in order to continue his employment. I found \nApplicant\u2019s statements at the hearing and in his SOR response about his marijuana use \nand his reason for falsifying his security documents to be credible. However, the \npersonal conduct concerns pertaining to Applicant\u2019s falsification of his 2006 security \nclearance application (SOR \u00b6 1.a); his February 12, 2007, lie to an OPM investigator \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); and his November 1, 2007, misleading answer to a DOHA interrogatory \n(SOR \u00b6 2.f) about the extent and/or recency of his marijuana use; cannot be mitigated \nat this time because they are too serious and too recent.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when he began using marijuana. He honorably \nserved his country as a U.S. Marine for four and a half years, rising to the rank of \nSergeant. He did not use illegal drugs while serving on active duty. He then returned to \nusing marijuana; however, he again stopped using illegal drugs in December 2006. He \nshowed he has the ability to abstain from marijuana use for lengthy periods of time. In \nhis SOR response and at his hearing, he frankly and candidly admitted his extensive \nhistory of marijuana use. He received some alcohol/drug counseling and therapy. He \nknows the consequences of drug abuse and excessive alcohol consumption. Applicant \ncontributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence of \ndisloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His character and good \nwork performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His \nsupervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to retain his \nemployment after his security clearance was called into question. His supervisor lauds \nhis hard work and dedication. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain from drug \nuse, and avoids future offenses he will eventually have future potential for access to \nclassified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant\u2019s extensive marijuana use lasted approximately seven or eight years (1993 to \n1998 and 2003 to 2006), and involved numerous uses of marijuana. He had a DUI in \n2006. He received some alcohol/drug counseling or treatment; however, he did not \nprovide documentation showing a positive prognosis. His numerous decisions to \npossess and use marijuana and to drive while intoxicated were knowledgeable, \nvoluntary, and intentional. Applicant failed to disclose his marijuana use from 2004 to \n2006 on his 2006 SF 86. On February 12, 2007, he lied to an OPM investigator, when \nhe failed to disclose that his most recent marijuana was in December 2006. On \nNovember 1, 2007, he provided false information in response to a DOHA interrogatory, \nwhen he failed to disclose that his most recent marijuana was in December 2006. He \nwas sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. These offenses show a \nserious lack of judgment and a failure to abide by the law. Such judgment lapses are \nrelevant in the context of security requirements. His misconduct raises a serious \nsecurity concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time.  \n \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct; however, he has fully \nmitigated drug involvement primarily because his illegal marijuana use is not recent.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b to 2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e to 2.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny her\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nOctober 16, 2008\n\n2\n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 5, 2008. She submitted an\nundated Answer to the SOR, which was received by DOHA on May 19, 2008. She\nrequested a decision without a hearing, and on July 18, 2008, the government\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8).\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within\n30 days of receipt. No response was received by the September 3, 2008, deadline. On\nSeptember 26, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.\nBased upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the\nSOR allegations (Item 2), eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\n13 delinquent debts totaling $16,073 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m), including an $8,317\njudgment debt owed a former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant admitted the debts without\nany explanations when she answered the SOR (Item 2). Her admissions are accepted\nand incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the evidence of record, I make\nthe following additional findings.\nApplicant is a 27-year-old single mother who has worked as an outside machinist\nfor a defense contractor since August 2006 (Item 4). The record does not reflect that\nshe has held a security clearance.\nApplicant had her first child in 1996, when she was still in high school.

Applicant was again unemployed, for\nabout two months until June 2005, when she accepted a position with a telemarketer.\nWithin the month, she began working as a machinist for a plastics manufacturer.\nFollowing another period of unemployment from November 2005 to January 2006, she\nwas placed by a temporary services agency in a customer care representative position.\nBy May 2006, she was again out of work until August 2006, when she started her\nemployment with the defense contractor as an outside machinist (Item 4).\nApplicant completed an e-QIP on March 7, 2007, from which OPM prepared a SF\n86 that was made available for review (Item 4). Applicant disclosed in response to\n\n3\nfinancial record inquiry (question 27D on the SF 86) that a judgment was awarded\nagainst her in May 2003 in the amount of $8,371 (SOR \u00b6 1.j):\nTHIS JUDGMENT WAS FILED AFTER AN APARTMENT FIRE. I WAS\nEIGHTEEN YEARS OLD, A FIRE STARTED ON THE KITCHEN STOVE.\nI PANICKED WHEN THE FIRE STARTED AND THREW WATER ON\nTHE FIRE INSTEAD OF SALT. I DID NOT HAVE RENTERS\nINSURANCE. [The landlord] FILED FOR A JUDGEMENT, STATING THE\nFIRE WAS MY FAULT AND I WOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE\nDAMAGES.\nApplicant also listed six unresolved delinquent debts in response to the financial\ndelinquency questions (on the SF 86, 28A. \u201cLAST 7 YRS, OVER 180 DAYS\nDELINQUENT ON ANY DEBTS?\u201d and 28B, \u201cCURRENTLY OVER 90 DAYS\nDELINQUENT ON ANY DEBTS?\u201d): a $2,831.54 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g), two\ncellular telephone debts of $102 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) and $66 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and three medical\ndebts of $63 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), $373 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and $63 (not alleged) (Item 4).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 29, 2007, revealed additional\ndelinquencies of $301 past due since September 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $847 on an auto\nloan owed since November 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $693 on a medical account in collection\nsince January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), and $335 on a collection account placed for $292 in\nSeptember 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant was also listed as an authorized user on a\ncredit card account with a retailer opened in December 2001 and charged off in the\namount of $417 in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The collection balance of the debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.g had risen to $2,942, and no progress had been made about resolving the other\ndebts listed on her SF 86 as well (Item 5).\nOn June 13, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nher financial issues. Applicant indicated she did not recognize the collection agencies\nacting as assignees for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.m, even though she\nhad listed each of these debts on her SF 86. She explained that the delinquent car loan\ndebt was for a repossessed car. She thought she had cosigned on a vehicle loan for her\nthen boyfriend but found out that it was solely in her name when it was repossessed.\nApplicant indicated she had heard nothing about the vehicle or loan since 2003 so she\nwas unsure whether the debt had been paid. As for the delinquent retail credit card debt\non which she was listed as an authorized user (SOR \u00b6 1.f), Applicant expressed her\nbelief her mother had opened the account. Applicant admitted that she had stopped\nmaking payments on a VISA card account balance of about $2,200 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), when\nshe was between jobs and struggling to support herself and her children, and it was\nplaced for collection in 2001/02. Applicant wanted to make payments on the debt but\ncould not afford to do so. She also acknowledged one unpaid medical debt of $693\n(SOR \u00b6 1.l), but she wanted to check on it since she has always been covered by\nMedicaid. Applicant explained that the $8,000 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.j) was awarded a\nformer landlord for fire-related damage to her apartment. She had not paid the judgment\nbecause she was contemplating filing for bankruptcy. She stated she would make\n\n4\npayments on the judgment and on the credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) if she does not file.\nBased on estimated monthly expenses of $1,079 (she was paying no rent), Applicant\nestimated a net remainder of $14 (Item 7).\nIn July 2007, Applicant took out an automobile loan of $11,787, to be repaid at\n$305 per month. As of December 2007, the account was current with a balance of\n$11,213 (Item 8).\nOn October 30, 2007, Applicant indicated in response to financial interrogatories\nfrom DOHA that she had done nothing to resolve her delinquent debt, including a\n$666.17 balance of a March 2003 financial judgment that had not been listed on her\nMarch 2007 credit report:\nAs of right now I am not financially able to resolve these debts. I\u2019m just\nmaking enough to cover my regular household expenses, especially being\na single mother with two kids. I have decided to use my tax refund for the\n2007 year which I should receive by February or March of 2008 to file\nbankruptcy on these debts because I don\u2019t know if and when I would ever\nbe able to pay them all off. (Item 6).\nAs of December 2007, Applicant\u2019s net salary had increased from $1,508 to\n$1,617 per month. She estimated her monthly living expenses (rent, clothing, utilities,\ncar expenses, car payment, and cell phone) at $1,377.50 (Item 7), but this figure does\nnot account for any food costs. It is also unclear whether she had miscellaneous\nexpenses.\nAs of January 22, 2008, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed no progress toward\nresolving the $8,371 judgment (SOR 1.j), the $830 past due balance for the\nrepossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.c), or the collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.k, and\n1.l. She reportedly owed $903 on a telephone services debt placed for collection in\nMarch 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The charged off $417 retail credit card balance (SOR \u00b6 1.f)\nwas still on her credit report as past due (Item 8). The $525 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and\nthe collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.h, and 1.l did not appear on her credit report\n(Item 8), but there is no indication that they have been paid. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\n\n5\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n6\nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency since about 2001, when debt\ntotaling about $1,500 became past due (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and a $63 medical debt). In\n2002, additional debt balances totaling about $3,644 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h) were placed for\ncollection. Two financial judgments totaling $8,896 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j ) were awarded\nagainst her, and two medical debts were placed for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l) in\n2003. In March 2004, a communications company placed a $102 delinquent balance for\ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.m). Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nWhen she completed her e-QIP in March 2007, Applicant reported six delinquent\ndebts and the $8,371 judgment, so she was clearly aware of the debt. In October 2007,\nApplicant expressed her intent to file for bankruptcy after she received her income tax\nrefund in spring 2008. There is no indication that she has made any payments on her\ndebts or that she has sought to relieve herself of the debt burden through bankruptcy.\nUnder the circumstances presented, AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d), AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol\u201d), and AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies to the extent that debts were\nincurred due to a personal calamity and to insufficient income. Her largest debt, the\n$8,371 judgment, was apparently due to a fire in her apartment. While Applicant\u2019s\nconduct caused or at least contributed to the damage, the fire was an unforeseen and\nunwanted circumstance. Her other debts became delinquent between 2001 and 2004,\nwhen she held a succession of various jobs not likely to pay enough to support herself\nand a child. A period of unemployment from June 2002 to August 2003 corresponds to\nher vocational/technical training for a career as a medical assistant, so it was within her\ncontrol. At the same time, it was reasonable for her to pursue a new career in the hope\nof making a better life for herself and her family.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s failure to address her indebtedness, especially the court\njudgments, is inconsistent with the responsible behavior required for AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully\napply. Applicant was aware as of March 2007, if not before, that she owed a debt of\n$102 and three others of less than $70 each. With only about $14 per month in\ndiscretionary income, she was not in a position to make meaningful efforts to pay even\nher minor debts. Her salary had increased by December 2007. Based on income and\nexpense figures she provided, she would have had a net monthly remainder of $239.50,\nbut this figure does not include any costs for groceries or miscellaneous expenses. As\nof June 2007, Applicant was spending $200 per month on groceries and $260 on\n\nDepartment Counsel indicated in the FORM that with the changes to her income and expense figures\n2\nin December 2007, Applicant had a negative monthly net remainder of over $200 (FORM at 5). Based just on\nthe salary and expense figures provided, Applicant has a positive remainder of $239.50, but it does not include\nthe costs of groceries or any miscellaneous expenses. \n7\nunexplained miscellaneous expenses.  So despite an increase in salary, her financial\n2\nsituation has not improved, in part because she now has to pay rent of $437.50 and\nhigher utility costs. Applicant told the government investigator in June 2007 that she had\nconsulted with an attorney about filing for bankruptcy. While a planned bankruptcy could\nalleviate the financial pressures,  there is no indication that she has filed or can be\nexpected to do so in the near future.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d) applies, but only to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Although Applicant admitted the debt\nwhen she answered the SOR, and it appears on the credit reports included in the record\nfor review, she denied opening the account when questioned by an investigator in June\n2007. She surmised her mother had opened the account in her name, although her\nmother had denied it. Per the March 2007 credit report, Applicant was only an\nauthorized user on the account. Although she may be legally responsible for the debt,\nconcerns for her financial judgment are not raised in the absence of evidence showing\nshe incurred the delinquency.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\n\n8\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant has not concealed from the government that she has had difficulty\nmeeting her financial obligations, but her handling of her financial matters continues to\nraise significant security concerns. Applicant remains under a burden of delinquent\ndebt, including a sizeable court judgment, that she has not repaid due to lack of funds.\nAt the same time, she financed the purchase of a vehicle in July 2007, taking out a loan\nof $11,787 and increasing her monthly car payment from $215 to $305 per month.\nAlthough Applicant has lower car costs (presumably maintenance and/or gasoline) of\n$134 per month, her overall savings amount to only $43 due to the higher car payment.\nBased on the total amount financed and the monthly payment amount, it is not\nscheduled to be paid off within 36 months. Whether or not this car was a discretionary\npurchase, her delinquent debt is likely to take a back seat to her car loan. Her January\n2008 credit report does not show any new delinquent accounts, but that alone is not\nenough to overcome the judgment concerns raised by her failure to date to make any\ngood faith efforts to resolve her delinquent debt. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. The Applicant admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c. and 1.d. of the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. The Applicant denied subparagraph 1.e with an explanation. 1.a. The Applicant admits, and the records show, that he has had four alcohol- related arrests - in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2004. The Applicant began drinking when he was a teenager in 1997. In 1998 he joined the Marine Corps and his drinking increased.

On February 12, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline G concerning the Applicant. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on March 26, 2008, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. The Applicant subsequently requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge on April 29, 2009.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\n1\n\n2\non April 30, 2009. I received the case assignment on May 1, 2009.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June\n16, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, which were also received without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on June 25, 2009. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant was 30 years old at the time of the hearing and single. He is\nemployed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. The Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c. and 1.d. of the SOR. Those admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact. The Applicant denied subparagraph 1.e with an\nexplanation. \n1.a. The Applicant admits, and the records show, that he has had four alcohol-\nrelated arrests - in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2004. The Applicant began drinking when he\nwas a teenager in 1997. In 1998 he joined the Marine Corps and his drinking increased.\nHe would drink to intoxication on an infrequent basis, maybe once or twice a year. As\ndescribed further below, the Applicant\u2019s drinking has decreased significantly since 2004.\n1.b. The first alcohol-related arrest of the Applicant occurred in June 1998. The\nApplicant was in the Marines at this time, finishing his advanced training. He was 20\nyears old and was arrested by the police at a beach in State A for underage possession\nof alcohol. The Applicant testified that he was released to his unit by the sheriff.\n(Government Exhibits 4 and 5; Transcript at 34-36.) \n1.c. The Applicant\u2019s second alcohol-related arrest happened in December 2001.\nHe was still in the Marine Corps, and due to ship out on an extended deployment. The\nApplicant and some friends traveled to the Applicant\u2019s home town in State B. They went\nto a club, where the Applicant had too much to drink, and he was arrested for Driving\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), Driving With Over .08% Blood Alcohol, and Open\nContainer While Driving. The Applicant deployed the following week, and he admits that\nhe basically forgot about the arrest.\nThe Applicant received an Honorable Discharge and left the Marines in\nSeptember 2002. In May 2003 the Applicant and his girlfriend got into a fight. The police\n\n3\nwere called and they arrested the Applicant when a records check revealed he had an\nactive warrant for Failure to Appear on the DUI charge.\nThe Applicant appeared in court, and pleaded guilty to the DUI and Failure to\nAppear charges. He was placed on three years informal probation, fined, ordered to\nperform community service and attend a first offender alcohol program. He attended the\nalcohol program and performed the community service. (Government Exhibit 6;\nTranscript at 36-42.)\n1.d. The Applicant\u2019s third alcohol-related arrest did not involve him drinking.\nRather, he was arrested in January 2003 in State C for Providing Liquor to Underage\nYouths (two girls) and Giving a False Police Report. He received a fine for this offense.\nThe Applicant stated that he did not know the girls were underage. (Government Exhibit\n7; Transcript at 42-45.)\n1.e. The Applicant\u2019s fourth and last alcohol-related arrest occurred in May 2004.\nThe Applicant testified that it was his fault as he had been drinking that day and left to\npick up a friend. He drove and was arrested by the police. He pleaded guilty and\nreceived a sentence including 60 days in jail, three years informal probation and a fine.\nHe also had to perform community service, attend an 18 month Multiple Offender\nAlcohol Program and have an ignition interlock device installed on his car. (Government\nExhibits 8 and 9; Transcript at 45.)\nThe Applicant successfully completed the 18 month program. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nE.) He had problems with the interlock device and had to appear in court several times\nfor alleged probation violations. However, the court records shows that the interlock\ndevice was malfunctioning and eventually replaced. (Government Exhibit 9 at 10-18;\nTranscript at 54-58.)\nThe Applicant testified that he found the 18 month program very useful, stating: \nI did learn a lot. I had a lot of time to think about what\nI\u2019d done in 18 months and how hard it was to do and all the\nthings I had to go through to get back to where I wanted to\nbe and pursue the things I wanted to pursue. I just - -\nbasically, in this Program, I learned everything I didn\u2019t even\nknow, and I know now that I was on a road I did not want to\nbe on. (Transcript at 53-54.)\nSince the 2004 incident the Applicant has vastly reduced his use of alcohol, not\nhaving anything to drink in the eight months before the hearing.  The Applicant admitted\nthat he was immature when these incidents occurred. He stated that he has learned his\nlesson, and that there have been no incidents in almost five years as of the hearing\ndate. (Transcript at 45-53, 58-60, 67-69.) \n\n4\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D consists of 13 letters of commendation from co-workers.\nThe first two letters are from the Applicant\u2019s first and second line supervisors. The\nApplicant is described as a person who is essential to the mission, \u201ca trustworthy\nemployee,\u201d someone with a \u201cgreat work ethic,\u201d and a person who holds himself to a\n\u201chigh moral and ethical standard.\u201d Several of the writers indicate that they have\nknowledge of the incidents stated in the SOR.\nThe Applicant is successful in his educational career. He has received an\nAssociate of Arts degree, has almost completed his Bachelor\u2019s degree, and has been\nadmitted into a Master\u2019s program. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C; Transcript at 46.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be considered as appropriate in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Security clearance decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG & 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was involved in four alcohol-related incidents between 1998 and\n2004.  The evidence also shows that the Applicant has used alcohol, occasionally to\nexcess, during the same period.  Since 2004, he has severely reduced his use of\nalcohol.\nThere are two Disqualifying Conditions that apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 22(a)\n\u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 22(c) states a concern is, \u201cHabitual or binge consumption\nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating conditions apply to\nthe Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23(a) states that it can be a mitigating conditions when,\n\u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d In addition, AG \u00b6 23(b)\nstates that it is also mitigating where, \u201cThe individual acknowledges his or her\n\n6\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome\nhis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use ( if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\nThe record shows that the Applicant had four alcohol-related incidents within six\nyears.  While certainly nothing to be taken lightly, there is no evidence of a pattern of\nabuse here.  His last incident occurred five years before the record closed and he has\nvastly reduced his alcohol use since 2004.  The Applicant admitted that he made\nmistakes with alcohol when he was younger (he is only 31 years old now). He testified,\nand the record evidence supports, that he has matured as a person, worked hard to\nsucceed in his career, and has decided that alcohol has no place in his future. These\nmitigating conditions apply and, when viewed along with the Whole Person Concept\ndiscussed below, supports a finding for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making this decision: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who may have had an alcohol problem in his younger\ndays. As described above, he has matured, changed his life, and is on the road to\nsuccess. There is little to no evidence that these incidents show a pattern, or that he is\nalcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that\nthe Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct. Based on this\nrecord, I find that the conduct was not recent (AG \u00b6 2(a)(3)); that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that there is little to no\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n7\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on September 23, 2006.  \nOn February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 15, 2008; answered it \non March 4, 2008; and requested a decision on the record without a hearing. DOHA \nreceived the request on March 6, 2008. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s written case on April 2, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s \nJune 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nevidence. Applicant responded to the FORM on May 2, 2008. His response was \nreceived at DOHA on May 6, 2008. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nThe FORM did not contain any information about France, the country referred to \nin the SOR. On May 28 I notified Department Counsel and Applicant that I intended to \ntake administrative notice of relevant adjudicative facts about France, based on two \ndocuments issued by the U.S. Department of State. My notifications are attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II. Neither party objected. Their responses are \nattached as HX III and IV. The documents on which I have taken administrative notice \nare attached as HX V and VI. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my \nFindings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, and he partially admitted \u00b6 1.c. He admitted all the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6 2, but explained that his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d is now his fianc\u00e9e, and they will be married in \nNovember 2008. His admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant was born in April 1981 in the U.S. of French parents. His father was \nworking in the U.S. for a U.S. corporation at the time of his birth. His family lived in the \nU.S. from 1981 to 1982, moved back to France for a year, lived in the U.S. from 1983 to \n1986, in France from 1986 to 1990, in the U.S. from 1991 to 1995, and in France from \n1995 to the present.  \n \nApplicant worked in the U.S. as an intern during the summer of 2003, and lived in \nFrance from September 2003 to September 2006, when he returned to the U.S. He \nattended college and obtained two master\u2019s degrees in France. He is now enrolled in a \ndoctoral program school in the U.S., studying policy analysis, and is employed as a \ndoctoral fellow by a federal contractor. He maintains regular email contact with several \nfriends and former classmates in France. He told a security investigator he intends to \nremain in the U.S. He maintains a bank account in France to enable his parents to \nrepay his student loans in France. As of January 2007, he had about $400 in the \naccount. He has no other property or assets in France.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, two brothers, and his sister-in-law are citizens and residents \nof France. His father retired in August 2006 after working more than 40 years for a U.S. \ncompany. His mother is a retired physical therapist. One brother works as a technical \ndirector for a private television network, and the other as a medical products salesman. \nHis sister-in-law is self-employed as a speech therapist. His fianc\u00e9e is a citizen and \nresident of France and is a college student. His fianc\u00e9e\u2019s father works at the French \nMinistry of Agriculture, where he manages pension funds for the agricultural industry. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe occupations of Applicant\u2019s friends, classmates, and colleagues with whom he \nmaintains contact in France are not reflected in the record, but none of them are \nconnected to the French government or any other foreign government. \n \n \nApplicant has held a French passport since he was a child. He obtained a U.S. \npassport as an adult. He visits his family in France regularly. He uses his French \npassport to enter France and his U.S. passport to reenter the U.S. He usually uses his \nU.S. passport for other foreign travel, but he used his French passport to visit Turkey \nbecause immigration agreements between Turkey and Europe made it easier to enter \nand exit Turkey with a French passport. Applicant has stated his willingness to \nsurrender his French passport, but there is no evidence in the record indicating he has \ndone so.  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about France. France is a \nmultiparty constitutional democracy. The president is elected by popular vote. There is a \nbicameral parliament, with the upper house (Senate) indirectly elected through an \nelectoral college and the lower house (National Assembly) directly elected. France is \nAmerica\u2019s oldest ally. It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the \nUN Security Counsel, NATO, and other multilateral institutions. It is one of NATO\u2019s top \nfive troop contributors. Relations between the U.S. and France are active and friendly. \nFrance is a close partner with the U.S. in the war on terror. At times, France and the \nU.S. have disagreed on major issues. For example, France withdrew its military forces \nfrom NATO in 1966, and it opposed the use of force in Iraq in March 2003 and did not \njoin the U.S.-led military coalition. Trade and investment between the U.S. and France \nare strong, and the U.S. is the largest foreign investor in France. The French \ngovernment generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but there have been \nproblems in some areas, including overcrowded and dilapidated prisons, lengthy pretrial \ndetention, and protracted investigation and trial proceedings. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with France and the U.S. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); he possesses a French passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he uses his French \npassport to enter and exit France (SOR \u00b6 1.c), he has traveled to France between \nDecember 2006 to January 2007, in March 2007, and between August and September \n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); he has stated his intention to renew his French passport (SOR \u00b6 \n\n \n5 \n \n \n1.e); and he used his French passport instead of his U.S. passport to enter and exit \nTurkey in at least 2002, 2004, and 2005. \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline C is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a \nway as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d Dual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to \nwarrant an adverse security clearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL \n1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an \napplicant is a dual national, but rather whether an applicant shows a preference for a \nforeign country through actions.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \nAG \u00b6 9.  \n \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant\u2019s possession \nand use of a French passport raises this disqualifying condition, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). This condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). This condition is \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s statement to a security investigator that he would be willing to \nrelinquish his French citizenship if necessary to obtain a clearance.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This condition is not established. \nAlthough Applicant has stated his willingness to surrender or destroy his French \npassport, he has presented no evidence he has done so. \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother, father, two brothers, a sister-in-law, his \ngirlfriend (now his fianc\u00e9e), and many friends, former classmates, and work associates \nare citizens and residents of France (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c). It also alleges he \nmaintains a French checking account (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFor example, the U.S. and France disagreed over the use of military force in Iraq. \n \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. \n00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). The \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family \ntie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). AG \u00b6 \n7(a). A disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Finally, a security concern may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \nApplicant\u2019s multiple family and social ties are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n(b), but his small bank account is insufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(e). His travel to France was \nfor the purpose of visiting his family and fianc\u00e9e, and it has no independent security \nsignificance.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant has close family and social ties in France, and his future \nfather-in-law is a French government official, albeit not connected with military or \ninternational issues. France is a friend and ally of the U.S., but it has disagreed with the \nU.S. on major policy issues, most recently on the use of military force in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s work in policy analysis makes him an attractive target for foreign influence. \nConsidering the totality of his foreign relationships, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). This \nmitigating condition is not established, because Applicant has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in both countries. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his family and fianc\u00e9e are neither casual nor infrequent. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C and \nB, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference and \nforeign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 27, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On \nJanuary 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 4. There is no allegation of falsification of the 2006 SF 86.   \n \n2GE 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Jan. 3, 2008). GE I is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nMay 13,2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, \nmodified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 4, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (GE 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 4, 2008, was provided to her, \nand she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.4 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on May 9, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for five debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f and 1.g), \nand said she did not recognize two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e). Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old.5 She married in 1981 and divorced in 1986. Her \nchildren were born in 1981 and 1984. She attended college from 1994 to 1997, and \nfrom 2000 to 2002. She received a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Policy in 2002. \nShe was unemployed from June 2002 to January 2004. From January 2004 to the \npresent she has been employed by government contractor as a welder and in quality \nassurance. She joined the United States Army, but never went on active duty. She did \nnot serve on active duty because the Army did not comply with her enlistment contract. \nShe said she received a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions.6 She has no \npolice record. She has not used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has never \nused illegal drugs while in a sensitive position.  \n \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Mar. 12, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated March 21, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant \nthat she had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n5GE 4 (2006 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n \n6 The file does not contain her military or enlistment records.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn her 2006 security clearance application, she disclosed that she had \napproximately $6,000 in delinquent debt, resulting from unemployment in 1999. She \nbecame a full-time student in 2000. She unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate with her \ncreditors. She was a single mother, and her former husband was not paying child \nsupport. She chose to maintain her home and feed her family over repaying her \ncreditors. She concluded, \u201cSince then I have graduated [from] college and now I am \nresponsible for student loans only, as my children are now grown adults and providing \nfor themselves.\u201d She did not explain what she was doing to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR lists seven delinquent debts. Applicant denies the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($4,173) and SOR \u00b6 1.e ($319). The file does not contain any information corroborating \nthe credit report, which is the sole evidence supporting her responsibility for these two \ndebts. These two debts are therefore unsubstantiated because a credit report in the \nface of any conflicting evidence is simply too unreliable to support an allegation of \ndelinquent debt (for example, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e could be duplications of \nother debts, or relate to other debtors). \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for five debts totaling $7,331 in her SOR \nresponse (GE 3): \n \n(1) SOR \u00b6 1.a ($500) was placed for collection in July 2000. \n \n(2) SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,563) was charged off in August 2001. \n \n(3) SOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,367) was placed for collection on a department store account \nin February 2002. \n \n(4) SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,799) was placed for collection on a credit union account in \nDecember 2002. \n \n(5) SOR \u00b6 1.g ($102) was placed for collection on a medical account in April \n2003.  \n \nApplicant had ample warning about the security concerns pertaining to her \ndelinquent debt. On April 2, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator interviewed her concerning her delinquent debts. She explained that \nbecause her efforts (mostly in 2000) to work with her creditors were refused, \u201cshe will \nallow these accounts to lapse. She has no intention to pay them.\u201d (GE 6). Her gross \nmonthly income is $7,600, and her net monthly income is $6,152. She pays $190 \nmonthly on her student loans, which have a balance of about $9,700 (GE 6). She does \nnot currently have any credit cards (GE 6). Her two largest monthly expenses are her \nrent payment of $975 and her car payment of $685 (GE 6). After paying her monthly \ndebts and expenses, she has monthly disposable income of $3,629 (GE 6). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \n7 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n8 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her OPM interview, her 2006 \ncredit report, and her SOR response. She admitted responsibility for five debts totaling \n$7,331 in her SOR response. The government established the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts.9  \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for five debts totaling about $7,331. Applicant is \ncurrently living in the same state where she attended college. She advised the OPM \ninvestigator in April 2007 that she thought her delinquent debts would lapse in 2013 (GE \n6). It is unclear when her last payments were made on these debts. If no payments \nwere made after May 13, 2002, then some or all of these debts may not be legally \nenforceable debts because some of the creditors have not filed suit as required by the \nsix-year Washington State statute of limitations. See Rev. Code Wash. \u00a7 4.16.040(1) \n(stating \u201can action upon a contract in writing, or liability express or implied arising out of \na written agreement\u201d must be filed within six years to preserve the creditor\u2019s right to \ncollect on the debt). The statute of limitation for contract actions in Washington state \nbegins to run when a party knows or, in the exercise of due diligence, should know of \nthe other party\u2019s breach. Architechtonics Constr. Mgmt., Inc. v. Khorram, 111 Wn. App. \n725, 45 P.3d 1142 (2002), review denied, 148 Wn.2d 1005, 60 P.3d 1212 (2003). \n \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and \njudicial value of application of the statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \n \n9\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 \n(S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This long-standing \nlegal doctrine may well reduce or eliminate any potential vulnerability to improper \nfinancial inducements. The degree that she is \u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d is also \nreduced. However, there is a possibility the six-year statute of limitations was tolled or is \notherwise not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient \ninformation to establish that Applicant established the statute of limitations defense to \nrepayment of her debts or that she otherwise showed good faith10 in the resolution of \nher debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because Applicant did not provide \u201cdocumented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue\u201d with respect to his SOR debts. She disclosed very little information about \nthese five debts. She did not provide proof of her most recent correspondence with her \ncreditors. Based on the low level of evidence required to meet the substantial evidence \ntest for establishment of a disqualifying condition, I conclude these five debts, totaling \nabout $7,331 are still valid, delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible for them.   \n \nApplicant did not disclose sufficiently unusual and recent circumstances as a \ncause for the delinquent debts to mitigate them for security clearance purposes. She did \nnot provide proof of financial counseling. Applicant could easily pay or settle the debts in \nlight of her current, ample income. She has elected not to pay or resolve her five \ndelinquent debts. Her overall conduct with her creditors casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her financial problems are continuing \n \n \n10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand likely to recur. She should have been more diligent and made greater efforts to \nresolve her delinquent debts, especially after being interviewed by an OPM investigation \nin April 2007, followed by receipt of the SOR in January 2008. She has not carried her \nburden of proving her financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in her favor. Her dedication to the \nwelfare of her children supports approval of her clearance. There is no evidence of any \nsecurity violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal issue), \nshe is a law-abiding citizen. She completed her college education, earning her Bachelor \nof Arts degree. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant was well aware of her financial responsibilities, and had ample resources to \npay her creditors. She learned of the security significance of these delinquent debts in \nApril 2007. His efforts to resolve her debts were insufficient when compared to available \nincome that she could have used to address her delinquent debts (especially after April \n2007 when she became aware of their significance). She did not show adequate actions \nfor timely resolution of his debts. Instead she chose to rely on the creditor\u2019s failures to \nfile lawsuits against her income and property. In sum, she did not make sufficient efforts \nto repay or resolve her debts after the contractor employed her, and her actions were \nnot adequate to fully resolve security concerns.         \n \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked, with a security clearance, for more than 10 years. This contractor receives set- aside contracts and hires a majority of employees with handicaps and barriers to employment. Applicant is illiterate. He and his wife of nine years are now living in separate households, to avoid fighting with each other. His wife receives about $600 per month in Social Security payments. Their daughter, age 9, and his step-daughter, age 14, live with their mother. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11, 13, 14, 26; Tr. at 8-9, 66, 83-85, 89; Answer, dated Jan. 31, 2008.)

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Angela Correa, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has substantial delinquent debt that he cannot afford to repay. He did\nnot deliberately falsify information about his debts on his security clearance application\nbecause he cannot read and did not understand the questions. Based upon a thorough\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on September 1, 2006. On January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nJuly 11, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 23, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on January 28 and 31, 2008, and requested a decision be\nmade without a hearing before an administrative judge. These answers, and some\ncharacter reference letters, were forwarded to DOHA by his personal representative on\nFebruary 5, 2008, in her capacity as his employer\u2019s Assistant Facility Security Officer.\nWhen Department Counsel learned that Applicant cannot read, he requested a hearing\npursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7, in order to ensure a fair process, conducted orally, in\nwhich all parties could be assured that Applicant understood and participated in\ndeveloping a comprehensive record. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nMarch 24, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case to me on March 25, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 2, 2008. Although Applicant did not\nsign and return his written receipt for the notice of hearing until April 11, 2008, both\nApplicant and his personal representative acknowledged on the record that they actually\nreceived it at least 15 days prior to the hearing, when I forwarded them a copy via email\non April 2, 2008. (Tr. at 14.) I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 22, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two other\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without\nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until May 6, 2008, in\norder for him to submit additional documentation. On April 28, 2008, Applicant\u2019s\npersonal representative submitted copies of his W-2 forms for the past two years to\nDepartment Counsel. Department Counsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s submission without\nobjection to its consideration on May 1, 2008. These documents were marked AE B,\nand Applicant did not submit any further evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on May 7, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has\nworked, with a security clearance, for more than 10 years. This contractor receives set-\naside contracts and hires a majority of employees with handicaps and barriers to\nemployment. Applicant is illiterate. He and his wife of nine years are now living in\nseparate households, to avoid fighting with each other. His wife receives about $600 per\nmonth in Social Security payments. Their daughter, age 9, and his step-daughter, age\n14, live with their mother. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11, 13, 14, 26; Tr. at 8-9, 66, 83-85, 89;\nAnswer, dated Jan. 31, 2008.) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the 15 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1,\ntotaling $27,464, that first became delinquent between April 2000 and July 2006. (GE 2;\nGE 4.) He denied that he deliberately falsified answers on his e-QIP, explaining that he\neither did not know about debts or misunderstood questions due to his illiteracy. No\nevidence was introduced that would support a finding of deliberate falsification, as\nopposed to ignorance or mistake, concerning the four incorrect \u201cNo\u201d answers pertaining\nto repossessions, judgments, and delinquencies alleged in SOR \u00b6 2. \n\n3\nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified concerning his present understanding of\nthe status of each SOR-alleged delinquent debt. (Tr. at 48-61.) He stated that the\ncharged-off debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.l resulted from the repossession of\nApplicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s former automobiles. He did not remember the details of the\ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, which his October 9, 2006 credit bureau report (CBR)\nreflected as another auto loan repossession charge-off. He did not dispute owing these\nthree debts, which total $14,550, and he has no funds available to repay them. He was\nunclear about the details of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.k,\nand 1.o, but neither disputed owing them nor offered any evidence that he had made\nany effort to resolve them. These six debts total $4,434. He remembered that he still\nowes the two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.n, totaling $748. He remembered\nhaving paid the $1,361 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h in order to\nobtain his Countrywide mortgage in September 2005. Although this debt still appeared\nas unpaid on his October 2006 CBR (GE 2 at 7), it did not appear on subsequent CBRs.\nOn balance, I find that this debt was repaid before the SOR was issued. \nApplicant said the $181 cable service debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a arose because\nthe company claimed he had not returned the cable box and he thinks he did. He\ntestified that he had not done anything to formally dispute the debt. (Tr. at 48-49.) He\nfurther testified that the $664 attorney\u2019s fee debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b related to his wife\u2019s legal\neffort to regain custody of her daughter from her own mother. He did acknowledge that\nhe now understands it is also his joint debt. (Tr. at 50.) Finally, he acknowledged that\nhis September 2005 Countrywide mortgage was 180 days in arrears in September\n2006, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. However, he testified, and subsequent CBRs confirm,\nthat he has since brought his mortgage payments current. His three auto repossession\nloans became delinquent in June 2005, October 2005, and July 2006. \nApplicant provided AE A to document his entrance, on April 19, 2008, into a\nfinancial counseling program rather than filing for bankruptcy. (Tr. at 108-112.) This\nservice\u2019s initial budget assessment showed a net monthly budget deficit of $3,439.\nAmong their initial recommendations was that he seek a second job to increase his\nincome, and lower monthly living expenses to pay down credit card debt. Applicant had\nnot implemented either of these recommendations by the time of the hearing. (Tr. at 42-\n47, 78.) He testified and offered AE B to show that his income fluctuates from year to\nyear based on duties assigned. His supervisors testified that they have implemented a\nnew payment plan to ensure his pay does not fall below $15 per hour to assist him with\nhis financial difficulties. (Tr. at 67-76, 89-90, 99.)\nApplicant submitted three character-reference letters from present and former\nsupervisors attesting to his reliability, dependability, trustworthiness, and good work\nperformance with his Answer. He also offered testimony from his direct and upper level\nsupervisors describing these same characteristics, as well as his history of compliance\nwith all security regulations. He primarily does manual indoor and outdoor maintenance\nwork, depending on the needs of the government facility and the season, and also\nworks some hazardous material/waste projects. His work does not involve use of\nclassified information, but access to many of his work areas requires a clearance.  \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 82.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe evidence shows that Applicant, as recently as October 2006, incurred at\nleast 14 SOR-listed delinquent debts totaling in excess of $27,000. His monthly net\nincome falls several thousand dollars short of being sufficient to pay his reported regular\nliving expenses and other debts, which did not include any delinquent debt repayments.\nThese debts all became delinquent during his current period of regular employment, as\nhe assumed more debt than he could afford to repay. Although he has brought his\nmortgage payments current, and repaid one credit card debt to obtain that mortgage,\nthe evidence establishes the continuing existence of 13 SOR-listed delinquent debts,\ntotaling more than $20,000, that Applicant incurred over the past eight years.\nSubstantial security concerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The five\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented roof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose over the last eight years, and a substantial\nnumber and amount remain delinquent at present. His family budget is such that he\ndoes not have the means to repay them, and is likely to incur additional delinquent debt.\nApplicant incurred all of this debt while working in his present job. His company has\narranged to pay him no less than $15 per hour during periods he is performing lower\npaying jobs, but there is no way to calculate to what extent that will change his available\nincome. He and his wife, who receives only $600 per month in social security payments,\nare voluntarily maintaining two separate households, while supporting two children,\nbecause they fight when living together. None of his delinquent debt involves medical\nbills. These are not circumstances that can be considered beyond his control. Applicant\noffered no evidence that he followed the minimal financial counseling he recently\nsought, or that he has any comprehensive plan to address his debt. He has not\ncontacted any of his creditors to arrange repayments. He said that he disputes the\namount claimed for the cable box, but showed no evidence that he followed through\nwith the creditor about that liability. There is no indication in this record that his financial\nissues are either under control or likely to improve in the foreseeable future.\nThis evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e).\nApplicant remains financially over-extended to a significant extent. He is well regarded\nat work, but that is insufficient to overcome other record evidence concerning his\ntrustworthiness, reliability and good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the evidence\nin this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nGiven his level of financial and legal sophistication, and his inability to read,\nApplicant testified credibly that he did not understand that he was incorrectly answering\nthe four finance-related questions listed in SOR \u00b6 2. Based on the evidence, including\nhis demeanor and testimony, I conclude that he did not deliberately omit the correct\ninformation in an attempt to conceal it and deceive the Government about its existence.\nAccordingly, I find no substantial evidence that he deliberately falsified or omitted\ninformation on his e-QIP security clearance application. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern includes substantial delinquent debts that he cannot afford to repay. Applicant\nis a mature, experienced adult who is accountable for his decisions and conduct even\nthough he is illiterate. His debts arose over a lengthy period, and persist to date. There\nis ongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress since he remains\nfinancially overextended. \n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s good reputation and performance at work is commendable, but\ninsufficient in itself to mitigate security concerns arising from his financial irresponsibility\nand excessive debt load. His indebtedness is quite likely to continue in the foreseeable\nfuture. His recent efforts to bring his mortgage payments current, seek financial\ncounseling and embark on a debt resolution program are steps in the right direction, but\nhe needs additional time to establish a pattern of responsibility in light of his lengthy\nindebtedness and apparently continuing financial over-extension.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his inability to satisfy debts, and history of\nnot meeting financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated any personal conduct security concerns, but did\nnot mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\n          FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                 For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:                                 For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:                                   For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:                                 For Applicant \n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is a 58-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has worked for defense contractors for over 38 years and has worked for his current employer a total of 19 years. He is transitioning from his position as a safety, security, and quality manager to the quality assurance, and process improvement area. Part of his duties included serving as the Facility Security Officer (FSO) since 1982.

On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 17, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

The record closed on March 26, 2008. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g, and denied the allegation in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 2.a.  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has worked for defense contractors for over 38 years \nand has worked for his current employer a total of 19 years.

(Tr at 4-5, 21-23, 48-52; Gov 1; Gov 2 at 5.)   \n \nOn August 15, 2008, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). He answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to questions 28(a) \n\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28(b) \n\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:  a $1,403 credit card account that was charged off in September \n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 5); a $1,769 credit card account that \nwas charged off in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 7); a \n$5,312 delinquent account related to a repossessed car (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 \nat 2; Gov 4 at 8); a $247 medical account placed for collection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 9, 11 ); a $1,041 credit card account, charged off in \nApril 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9); a $5,487 credit card account \nclosed by the credit grantor (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 6); and a $2,980 account \nplaced for collection in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Gov 4 at 10.)   \n \nApplicant states that he did not intend to falsify his e-QIP application. He believed \nthat he did not have to list older debts.  He answered the question based on his current \ndebt status.  He states all of his recent debts are current. (Tr at 12-18, 36-37; Answer to \nSOR.) \n \nApplicant claims most of the delinquent accounts were the result of his 2000 \ndivorce. He agreed to be responsible for the marital debt in order to be allowed to keep \nhis home. (Tr at 47.)  Around the time of the divorce, a lawyer recommended that he file \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor bankruptcy but he decided against it.  He states he has done his best to pay off \neverything that he can. He states he has paid off approximately $10,000 in debts since \nthe divorce. (Tr at 47-48; Answer to SOR.) In 2000, his son was shot in the course of his \nduties as a security guard.  Applicant supported his family while he was recuperating. \nHe estimates he spent $5,000 in 2000 to purchase groceries and other needs for his \nson\u2019s family. (Tr at 70-72; Answer to SOR.)   \n \nThe first time he obtained a copy of his credit report was during his divorce in \n2000.  He obtained another copy of his credit report in 2003 when he refinanced his \nhome. (Tr at 56-58.)  He discussed his financial issues during an interview with the \ninvestigator conducting his background investigation in mid 2007. (Tr at 58; Answer to \nSOR.) \n \nThe current status of the debts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Charged off credit card account for $1,403.  Applicant refuses to pay \nthis bill because he was overcharged late fees.  He charged $190 on account. His limit \nwas $200.  The credit card company charged him late fees because the total was over \n$200 after the interest was added. Aside from the $190 in charges, the balance of the \ndebt is interest and late fees.  He did not pay the $190 in actual charges. He had no \ncontact with the company for over a year. Account remains outstanding. (Tr at 37-40; \nAnswer to SOR.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $1,769 charged off credit card account. Applicant thought he had \npaid this off. He was approved for another loan with the same company. Account \nremains outstanding. (Tr at 40.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $5,312 delinquent account related to a car repossession. Applicant \ndisputes this account. In approximately 2005, he cosigned on a loan for a used \nautomobile for his fiance\u2019s daughter and her boyfriend. Two weeks after purchasing the \ncar, the car started to have mechanical problems. The car was turned back into the \ndealer. The principal signers on the loan have not paid the balance so the company is \nattempting to collect from Applicant as the co-signer on the loan. Applicant refuses to \npay this account on principal. (Tr at 41-42, 58-60; Answer to SOR.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  $247 medical collection account.  Applicant was not aware of this \ndebt. He has the money to pay the bill but wants to know what the debt is before he \npays it. He is attempting to find out what the account is for. In his answer to the SOR, he \nindicated that it was a medical bill from a specialist and he thought his insurance \ncompany paid for it. Account remains outstanding. (Tr at 43.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $1,041 charged off credit card account. Applicant testified that he is \nnot sure what this account is for. He has not contacted anyone to find out what the debt \nis for.  Account remains outstanding. (Tr at 44.)   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f:  $5,487 credit card account that was past due and closed by the credit \ngrantor. Applicant testified that he negotiated a repayment plan in 2001 where he \nagreed to pay $50 per month over 18 months. After the hearing, upon review of his \nrecords, Applicant discovered that he agreed to pay $20 per month. He paid using an \nallotment from his paycheck. In 2003, he requested the creditor send him a statement \nregarding the status of his account. The creditor would not send a statement pertaining \nto the status of the account until after the last payment was made. Applicant argued with \nthe creditor and refused to make any further payments.  Account remains outstanding. \n(Tr at 44-46; 60-64; AE B; Answer to SOR.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: $2,980 collection account. Applicant does not recognize this account.  \nThe account number for this account is the same as the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nIt appears the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b transferred to this new collection agency. (Tr at 47, 66-\n67; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 10.)  \n \nApplicant provided a personal financial worksheet in conjunction with answers to \ninterrogatories provided on October 4, 2007. After monthly expenses, he had \napproximately $995 left over each month. (Gov 2.) His gross annual salary is \napproximately $75,000.  Currently paperwork is being processed for his promotion. \nOnce he is promoted, he anticipates making $100,000 per year. (Tr at 73.) He has not \nattended any formal financial counseling. (Tr at 76.) \n \nApplicant is highly thought of at work by both his peers and superiors.  He has \nreceived numerous awards and citations throughout his career. (Tr at 18-35; AE A.) His \nrecent evaluation gives him an overall assessment of high contributor. Comments from \nthe evaluation describe Applicant as \u201cwilling to go the extra mile.\u201d He \u201cexceeds key \nobjectives and expectations.\u201d He is \u201ca can do self starter, who continually seeks ways to \nimprove.\u201d (AE B at 1-7.)  Applicant is also active in the local community. (AE B at 5; \nAnswer to SOR.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations since 2000. He currently has six unresolved delinquent accounts \nwith a total approximate balance of $15,259. \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. None \nof the debts alleged in the SOR are resolved. Although Applicant claims that these \ndebts are old and that he is current on his recent financial obligations, his lack of action \ntowards resolving his older delinquent accounts raise questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems began when his first marriage ended in divorce in 2000. During that same \nyear, Applicant provided support to his son\u2019s family. There were conditions that were \nbeyond the Applicant\u2019s control which contributed to his financial situation. The next \nquestion to consider is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. It \nhas been over seven years since the divorce. Several unresolved debts remain. \nApplicant has over $900 left over each month which he could have applied towards \nresolving these accounts. He took no action to resolve these accounts even after being \ninterviewed during his background investigation in mid-2007. Applicant did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight because of his \nlack of action towards resolving the delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant did not attend financial counseling.  Most of the debts \nalleged in the SOR remain unresolved.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant took minimal steps \ntowards resolving the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.        \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply.  Applicant disputes several debts, among them SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and \n1.c.  However, little action was taken to resolve the disputes. The issues remained \nunresolved at the close of the record.    \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent accounts to section 28(a) and 28(b) on his e-QIP application. Personal \nConduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 17(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies to this allegation. \nApplicant claims he misunderstood the question and thought he had to list current \ndelinquent accounts. His current accounts are up-to-date. He believed that he did not \nhave to list older debts. He had no intent to falsify his e-QIP application. I find \nApplicant\u2019s explanation relatively credible. I find for Applicant with respect to the \npersonal conduct concern.   \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s outstanding \nwork history and favorable work evaluations. However, an applicant with a good or even \nexemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative security implications.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation raised security concerns. His 2000 divorce caused some \nof the financial problems, however, it has been over seven years since the divorce. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve the remaining delinquent accounts have been minimal \neven though he appears to have sufficient income each month to apply towards his \ndelinquent accounts. Although Applicant\u2019s evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this \ntime this decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of \na DoD security clearance. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future and he were to arrange a satisfactory repayment plan \nwith his creditors to repay his delinquent accounts, he may well demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of security worthiness. It is premature to conclude so at this time. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is denied.\nOn November 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the allegations, on December 1,\n2008, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 5, 2009. On\nMarch 16, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the case for April 9, 2009. It\nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nwas held as scheduled. At the hearing, I received six government exhibits and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on April 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old man with two adult children. He has been married for\n32 years. He has a high school diploma, and has earned two years of college credits.\nHe has worked in the marine design field since 1980 (Tr. 17). \nApplicant has approximately $25,000 of debt in various stages of delinquency\nincluding, but not limited to, car notes (SOR subparagraphs 1.g and 1.r), a payday loan\n(SOR subparagraph 1.d), credit card bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.h through 1.j), and\nmedical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.m through 1.o). One of the car note delinquencies\nstems from a repossession (SOR subparagraph 1.g), and three of the SOR debts\nresulted in judgments (SOR subparagraphs 1.d through 1.f).\nApplicant\u2019s finances were stable through the late 1990s. Then, his mother-in-law\nwas stricken with terminal cancer (Tr. 9). As she became increasingly disabled,\nApplicant incurred more of her household management expenses (Tr. 27).\nIn June 2000, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Later that year, the\nbankruptcy debt was discharged. The amount discharged is unknown from the record.\nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s employer reduced his work hours (Tr. 66). This reduction\nwas unrelated to Applicant\u2019s performance. At or about the same time, his wife was\ndiagnosed with cancer, and was rendered unable to work for several months (Tr. 71).\nHe again began to accrue delinquent debt. Both Applicant and his wife, whose cancer is\nnow in remission, have been working full-time without interruption for the past four years\n(Tr. 54).\nIn September 2002, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The\namount included in the plan is unknown from the record. In June 2004, the plan was\ndismissed because of Applicant\u2019s noncompliance. The following month, Applicant re-\nfiled the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. It was dismissed in October 2005 because he\ndid not complete the court-ordered payment plan (Tr. 29; Exhibit 3 at 22).\nIn August 2006, a judgment was entered against Applicant in favor of a jewelry\nstore in the approximate amount of $3,000 (SOR subparagraph 1.e). The debt stemmed\nfrom jewelry Applicant purchased the year he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 36).\nIn May 2007, a judgment was entered against Applicant in the approximate\namount of $950 (SOR subparagraph 1.f). He does not recognize the creditor (Tr. 38).\n\n3\nAt some time in 2007, Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed (Tr. 39-40). At the time of\nthe repossession, he owed approximately $15,500 (SOR subparagraph 1.g). It is\nunknown from the record whether the dealer has resold the car.\nApplicant listed a $5,000 tax lien on his security clearance application that is not\nincluded on the SOR (Exhibit 1 at 37). This tax debt stems from a tax return delinquency\nthat began accruing in the 1980s. He satisfied the lien through a payment plan in 2008.\nApplicant attributes some of his difficulty in managing his finances to his\nchildren\u2019s college costs. He spent approximately $28,000 on his son\u2019s tuition (Tr. 73).\nHe pays approximately $6,000 toward his daughter\u2019s tuition (Tr. 74). She is still in\ncollege.\nApplicant has satisfied his home mortgage (Tr. 46). In an effort to get his\nfinances under control, he and his wife moved into a rental property, and rented their\nhome. They pay $1,400 monthly in rent. They receive $725 from the tenant who rents\ntheir home (Tr. 56).\nApplicant has retained an attorney, and is preparing to file for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy again. The attorney is in the process of identifying and contacting all of\nApplicant\u2019s creditors. Applicant anticipates that all of the SOR debts will be included in\nthe bankruptcy filing. Currently, Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses exceed his monthly\nincome by approximately $1,400 (Exhibit 3 at 5).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies accrued over the past nine years, trigger\nthe application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant did not experience any major financial problems until the late 1990s\nwhen he incurred multiple expenses assisting his mother-in-law who was stricken with\nterminal cancer. The debts he accrued during these period, however, were discharged\nthrough a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Within two years of the discharge, Applicant\u2019s financial\ndelinquencies recurred, compelling him to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.\nAlthough he attributes this recurrence to a work slowdown and his wife\u2019s temporary\nunemployment, they have been working full-time without interruption for the past four\nyears. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is only partially applicable. \nNone of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. Although Applicant recently\nsatisfied a tax delinquency that was not listed in the SOR, it was outstanding for nearly\n20 years. Further, although Applicant is working with an attorney to file for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy protection, two previous efforts failed. Applicant has not mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n5\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant accrued approximately $25,000 of delinquent debt between 2000 and\n2008. Shortly before he began accruing this debt, he had received a discharge of his\ndebts through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process. Two successive attempts at satisfying\nhis delinquencies through the Chapter 13 bankruptcy process have been unsuccessful.\nConsequently, the likelihood of continuance or recurrence of Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems remains unacceptably high. Evaluating this case in light of the whole person\nconcept, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on February 29, 2008 (Item 5).  On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant \ndetailing security concerns for foreign preference under Guideline C (Item 1).  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 24, 2008 (Item 3). \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated written response admitting all of the \nfactual allegations (Item 4).  She elected to have the matter decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on January 9, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material \n(FORM) on January 26, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, and \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant \ntimely submitted additional information for consideration on February 3, 2009.  On \nFebruary 17, 2009, Department Counsel noted he had no objection to consideration of \nthe additional material.  The case was assigned to me on February 20, 2009.  Based on \na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nessential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR with \nexplanation.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 42 year old independent translator and interpreter.  She is seeking \na security clearance to serve as a translator and interpreter of Greek.  She is a native \nborn United States citizen.  She married a Greek citizen in 1986, but the marriage did \nnot last long.  She married a dual United States and Greece citizen in 2001 and that \nmarriage is now terminated.  She is a single parent.  Her mother is deceased but was a \ncitizen of Greece.  Her father is a citizen and resident of Greece.  Her former in-laws \nwere born in Greece but are now citizens and residents of the United States.  Her \nbrother is a citizen of the United States on United States military assignment in Greece \n(Item 5). \n \n \nApplicant admits that she sought and received Greek citizenship in 1992 thus \nbecoming a dual citizen of the United States and Greece.  She obtained Greek \ncitizenship so she did not have to apply for resident and work permits yearly.  At the \ntime, she wanted to live and work in Greece.  She considers herself a dual Greece and \nUnited States citizen but she does not possess a Greek passport (Item 4). \n \n \nApplicant admits she has a Greek identification card which is needed to conduct \nordinary business in Greece.  She must use the card to transact banking business, as \nwell as pay bills and taxes.  The card is similar to a driver's license identification in the \nUnited States.  Applicant also voted in Greek elections which is mandatory for Greek \ncitizens.  Greek citizens must have voting stamps in their voting booklet to pay taxes \nand receive other governmental services (Item 4). \n \n \nApplicant admits that she was a resident of Greece for periods of time.  She \nspecifically admits she resided and worked in Greece from June 1988 until 2001 after \nher own and her parent's divorces.  She also worked and resided in Greece from \nNovember 2002 until June 2003.  She admits she received Greek health benefits during \nher lengthy stay working there.  Like all other people working in Greece, health \npremiums were withheld from her salary while she was employed in Greece.  She \nadmits traveling to Greece to visit her father and her brother in 2004, 2005, 2006, and \n2007.  At the time, her brother was stationed in Greece for the United States military.  \nApplicant also owns with her second husband an apartment in Greece worth \n\n \n3 \n \n \napproximately $90,000.  She has a Greek bank account to be able to conduct business \nrelated to the apartment (Item 4).  \n \n \nApplicant stated that her best interests are with the United States.  She moved to \nGreece at age 20 after an abusive marriage wanting to start a new life.  She applied for \nGreek citizenship through her grandfather's status as a Greek citizen to avoid obtaining \nannual work and residence permits when she was living and working in Greece.  She \nobtained an identification card issued to all Greek citizens and voted in Greek elections \nwhich is mandatory for Greek citizens.  She does not follow Greek politics.  She \nreturned to the United States in 2001 when she remarried.  She is now a single parent \nworking as a translator interpreter.  Her only loyalties are to the United States.  She \nplans to remain in the United States (Answer to FORM, dated February 3, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States (AG \u00b6 9).  Applicant \nrequested and received Greek citizenship even though she was a native born United \nStates citizen.  She considers herself a dual citizen of Greece and the United States.  \nShe has a Greek identification card and voted in Greek elections which are mandatory \nfor Greek citizens.  She lived extensively in Greece and travels there frequently. She \nreceived health benefits from Greece when she lived there.  Her father resides in \nGreece and her brother is in Greece on United States military orders.  These factors \nraise Foreign Preference Disqualifying Conditions (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) \"Exercise of any \nright, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a United States citizen \nor through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; (3) accepting educational, medical, \nretirement, social welfare, or other benefits from a foreign country; and (7) voting in a \nforeign election.\"  Her requesting and receiving Greek citizenship also raises FP DC AG \n\u00b6 10(b) \"action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American \ncitizen.\"   \n \nApplicant sought dual citizenship with Greece even though she was a native born \nUnited States citizen.  Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) AG 11(a) \"Dual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country\" does not \napply.  The United States Supreme Court has recognized a right under the United \nStates Constitution for United States citizens to have dual citizenship with another \ncountry (Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967)).  However, eligibility for a security \nclearance must be determined by application of the disqualifying conditions for foreign \npreference under the factual circumstances.  The President in promulgating the \ndisqualifying conditions could have specified that dual citizenship by itself was a security \nconcern, but he did not.  The rule that was promulgated raises a security concern based \non an exercise of dual citizenship.  Applicant has exercised her dual citizenship.  She \nmoved to Greece and stayed there for many years.  It is recognized that she moved \nthere after an abusive marriage.  Her moving to Greece after an abusive marriage \nshows an affinity for that country in times of trouble over her native country of the United \nStates.  She remained in Greece until she married again to a dual Greek and United \nStates citizen.  Applicant did not have to obtain a Greek identification card but did so \n\n \n5 \n \n \nonly to ease her ability to remain and work in Greece.  This also required her to vote in \nGreek elections which are mandatory for Greek citizens.  However, the only reason \nApplicant exercised her dual citizenship to vote was because she voluntarily chose to \nobtain Greek citizenship with the requirement to exercise her rights of citizenship by \nvoting.  While voting is mandatory for Greek citizens, her voluntarily seeking Greek \ncitizenship is the action that required her to exercise her dual citizenship rights and \nobligations.  Applicant also maintains an apartment and bank account in Greece to ease \nher visits and stays in Greece.  She traveled to Greece many times.  Her father is a \nresident of Greece.  Applicant has extensive family and filial ties to Greece.  She \nreceived health benefits from Greece even though the premiums were withheld form her \nsalary.  She did not present facts to raise FP MC AG \u00b6 11(b) \"The individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\"  This accumulated evidence \nshows that Applicant has a preference for Greece over the United States.  She has not \npresented sufficient evidence to establish she does not have such a preference.  \nApplicant's statement that she is a United States citizen and she does not have a \npreference for Greece over the United States is not sufficient to overcome the \ngovernment's evidence of a foreign preference for Greece raised by Applicant's actions.  \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns for foreign preference raised by her \nexercise of the rights of foreign citizenship in Greece. \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is a native born United States citizen who sought and received Greek \ncitizenship while a United States citizen.  She spent extensive time living and working in \nGreece.  She exercised her dual citizenship with Greece by obtaining a Greek \nidentification card which, as a citizen, required her to again exercise a right of \ncitizenship by voting in Greek elections.  She received health benefits from Greece.  \nShe purchased and owns property in Greece and has a bank account in a Greek bank.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant exercised her rights of dual citizenship with Greece because it made living in \nand visiting Greece easier for her.  She has a preference for Greece over the United \nStates and has not established that her preference is for the United States.  Access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 28, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On September 16, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  FORM Item 4. \n \nApril 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn October 14, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated December 23, 2008, was provided to \nher by letter dated December 29, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA \ntransmittal letter on January 8, 2009. She was afforded a period of 30 days to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In her response \nto the FORM, Applicant submitted a one-page handwritten letter with explanations \nabout some of the SOR allegations, and a notarized letter from her ex-husband. DOHA \nreceived her response to the FORM on February 23, 2009. The case was assigned to \nme on March 12, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.i. She failed to \nadmit or deny SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h, and I considered all of them denied. She denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old courier-driver working for a defense contractor.3 She \nmarried her spouse in November 1970 and they were divorced in July 1999. She has \nfive children, two daughters, ages 30 and 23 and three sons, ages 28, 21, and four. She \nreceived her real estate license in October 2006. Except for her real estate courses, she \ndisclosed no other education.  \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since March 2000. She worked for \ntwo government contractors during this period, first as a file clerk from June 2001 to \nOctober 2004, and then as a courier-driver from July 2005 to the present for her current \nemployer (Item 4).  \n \nIn her security clearance application, Applicant disclosed she filed for bankruptcy \nprotection in August 2003. She also disclosed having one debt that was over 180 days \ndelinquent at the time she completed the e-QIP. Her security clearance background \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 4 (2007 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \ninvestigation addressed her financial problems, and included the review of her March \nand August 2008 credit bureau reports (CBR).  \n \nIn her answer to the SOR and in her response to the FORM, Applicant claimed \nnot to have knowledge of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. She said she wanted \nto contact these creditors to resolve both debts and was not able to do so because she \ndoes not know who to contact. She presented no documentary or corroborating \nevidence of any efforts taken to resolve these debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (entered against her in March 2003), \nwas included in her December 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Applicant stated \nshe had to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2003, \u201cbecause of the situation \n[her] (1999) divorce put [her] in\u201d (answer to the SOR). She provided no further details or \ninformation about her financial problems before her bankruptcy filing or thereafter.  \n \nConcerning the state tax liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h, Applicant \nstated she was not aware of them. She explained that over 10 years ago, she and her \nex-husband owned a pharmacy business with a third partner. She was a stockholder \nand the vice president of the corporation, but she was never involved in the day-to-day \noperation of the business. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant first explained she did \nnot disclose the liens in her e-QIP because her ex-husband assured her that the tax \nliens had been taken care of, and that they were more than seven years old and outside \nof the requested information. She then stated that she found out about the tax liens the \nfirst time she had to pull up her credit report (CBR) after her divorce (Item 3). It is not \nclear from her explanation when she looked at her CBRs and discovered the liens. It \nappears, however, it was sometime around 2003 when she filed her bankruptcy.  \n \nAccording to her ex-husband, most of the ten years they were in business, \nApplicant was a homemaker and took care of their kids. He averred Applicant had no \nknowledge the business owned any back taxes at the time it was dissolved. Her ex-\nhusband claimed that their business partner paid all back taxes and was granted a \nwaiver of penalties and interests. He and Applicant applied for a similar waiver last fall, \nand he expects the waiver will be granted in March-April 2009.4  \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.i, Applicant admitted the debt. She explained she made the \nmistake of cosigning a car note for one of her daughters. Her daughter was unable to \npay the car note, and they voluntarily turned in the car to the seller. The debt is \noutstanding. Applicant provided no explanation as to what she intends to do to resolve \nthis debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, alleged that Applicant falsified question 27 of her January \n2008 security clearance application (asking whether in the last seven years she had any \nliens filed against her for failing to pay taxes or other debts, or any unpaid judgments), \n \n4  See Applicant\u2019s ex-husband statement, dated February 2009, included with her response to the \nFORM. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nwhen she answer \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose the liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through \n1h, and the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \n \nApplicant claimed she was not aware of the liens for various reasons: she was \nnever involved in the day-to-day operation of the business; her ex-husband assured her \nthat the tax liens had been taken care of; the liens were more than seven years old; and \nshe found out about the tax liens the first time she had to pull up her credit report after \nher divorce. Applicant\u2019s contradictory explanations fail to convincingly show she was not \naware of the tax liens when she completed her January 2008 security clearance \napplication. Concerning the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant did not pay it. \nHowever, it was discharged as part of her 2003 bankruptcy. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.c, I find that Applicant falsified question 28 of her security \nclearance application (asking whether in the last seven years she had been over 180 \ndays delinquent on any debts or whether at the time she was 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt), because she answer \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nthrough 1.h.5 As previously discussed, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show she \nhad no knowledge of the alleged debts, tax liens, and judgment at the time she \nsubmitted her e-QIP. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s contradictory explanations are not credible.  \n \n \nApplicant considers herself to be an honest, hard working person, with high \nintegrity. She averred she did not and would not lie about anything. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n5  Regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant\u2019s last action on this debt occurred in June 2004, and her last \naction on SOR \u00b6 1.c occurred in 2001 (CBRs). It is possible she was not aware of these debts, or that the \ndebts were included in her 2003 bankruptcy. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n6  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent/charged off accounts, a judgment, and tax \nliens totaling approximately $47,583. Except for her 2003 bankruptcy, Applicant \npresented no evidence of efforts to pay or resolve the alleged financial obligations, \nmany of which have been delinquent for many years. I find that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d were \nprobably included in her 2003 bankruptcy discharge. Considering the sparse record \nevidence, I find that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.i remain \noutstanding. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and, AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to raise the full applicability of any \nmitigating condition. Her financial problems are ongoing and her evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely that they will recur. Her \nfinancial problems and her failure to fully address the security concerns cast doubt on \nApplicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence that could establish circumstances beyond \nher control contributing to her inability to pay his debts, i.e., her divorce, and being a \nsingle mother of five children. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence is not sufficient to show how her 1999 divorce continues to impact her current \nfinancial situation, and whether she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAlthough she has been consistently employed since March 2000, she presented little \nevidence of effort to contact creditors or to resolve her debts beyond her 2003 \nbankruptcy from the day she acquired the debts to the day he answered the FORM. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, there are no clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. Her inability to pay even \nsmall debts show she was financially overextended. Considering Applicant substantial \ndebt, she also failed to establish that she is no longer financially overextended. She also \nfailed to present any evidence that she received financial counseling and that her \nfinancial problems are not likely to recur. The remaining mitigating conditions are not \nreasonably raised by the facts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well trained \nwoman, and a good mother. She has been successful working for two defense \ncontractors during a combined period of approximately six and one-half years. There is \nno evidence of any security violation, or that she is not a good, reliable and competent \nworker. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis such as the lack of credibility of her conflicting \nexplanations. Also, when she completed her security clearance application, she \ndeliberately failed to disclose her full financial situation. Considering the number and \naggregate value of debts and liens, Applicant knew or should have known of her debts \nand liens at the time she completed her security clearance application.  \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s financial behavior and personal \nconduct raise doubt about her ability to have access to classified information. \u201cBecause \nof the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against \ngranting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err \non the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking \n[a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990).  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a & 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 15, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 23, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable decision.\nApplicant asserts that he feels he only owes a small portion of the outstanding debts\nattributed to him, that his ex-wife accumulated many of the debts behind his back while he was\ndeployed in the military, that he intends to contest most of the spousal and child support arrearages\ncurrently outstanding against him, that he has given twenty years of faithful service to his country,\nthat he has control over his finances now that he is away from his ex-wife, and that he is trustworthy.\nApplicant also states that he was not well prepared for his hearing, could not afford an\nattorney, did not understand that he could use character witnesses, and did not speak well in the\nhearing setting.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge nor do they\nestablish a denial of procedural due process rights under the Directive.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had a 2002 bankruptcy which discharged more than $93,000\nof debt. Applicant\u2019s current total delinquent debt is approximately $50,000.  The Judge also found\nin Applicant\u2019s favor regarding several of the SOR allegations.  The Judge acknowledged  that\nApplicant\u2019s wife was responsible for some of the debt, but she explained why this fact did not\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  A review of the record indicates that the Judge\u2019s\nfactual findings are supported by the evidence.  \n  \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She concluded that, notwithstanding the partial applicability of two\nGuideline F Mitigating Factors, the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to overcome\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  Specifically, the Judge noted that Applicant had engaged in\nrepayment efforts or efforts to resolve debts through a 2002 bankruptcy and had paid a number of\nsmall debts.  The Judge ultimately concluded, however, that because of the substantial amount of\ndelinquent debt remaining, Applicant had not established sufficient mitigation to satisfy his burden\nof overcoming the government\u2019s case.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the record.  The\nJudge also considered Applicant\u2019s service to the country and the difficulties presented by Applicant\u2019s\nmarriage, separation, and divorce in her whole person analysis.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\n\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on December 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January\n13, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 3, 2009. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-3), which were received into the record without\nobjection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE A-C), without\nFebruary 23, 2009\n\nApplicant was unemployed from August to September 2007, just prior to his current employment.\n1\n2\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript on February 11, 2009. Based upon a review of\nthe record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 3, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, 1.g through 1.i, 1.n and 1.q. He denied the\nother allegations. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility\nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1984 and attended a community college in 1985. He served in the U.S.\nNavy from 1986 until his retirement in August 2006 (AE B). He held a clearance during\nhis military career. He has been employed with his current employer since September\n2007 (GE 1).  \n1\nApplicant married in November 1986. He has three children from his marriage\n(Tr. 12). When Applicant retired, his wife informed him that she wanted a divorce.\nApplicant and his wife had financial difficulties during the marriage. His wife also had\ncredit card debt when she married Applicant. They purchased a house and lived beyond\ntheir means using credit extensively. Applicant and his wife both used credit cards on a\nregular basis to \u201cget by\u201d each month. He estimates this was a trend in their marriage\nfrom 1996 until 2000. Applicant received financial counseling on several occasions but\nthe bills kept mounting and despite working another job, he and his wife had delinquent\ndebt that he could not pay. They filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2002 (Tr. 14).\nAfter the bankruptcy, Applicant and his wife bought a new vehicle and they were\ntimely with payments. When Applicant was at sea, his wife continued to use credit cards\nand did not pay the household bills. Applicant did not know that their financial situation\nwas deteriorating. He acknowledged that there was internet access on the ship but he\ndid not have access to his banking accounts. He did not receive emails. Therefore, he\ndid not realize the magnitude of the delinquent debt that was being amassed while he\nwas deployed.\nWhen Applicant and his wife separated and divorced in 2007, she received half\nof his property. Applicant paid alimony and child support directly to his wife ($3,000 a\nmonth). His wife sought court relief in 2007, because she asserted that Applicant had\nnot paid all the alimony or child support according to the Settlement Agreement.\nApplicant was found to be in arrears. He is attempting to contest the arrears because he\npaid the money directly to his ex-wife but he does not have receipts for money given to\nher. Applicant\u2019s wages are garnished for 50% of his income (AE A). Half of his\nretirement check also goes for support. He also pays for health insurance and life\ninsurance for a total of $1,572.79 per month.  \n\n3\nApplicant has a Modification Hearing scheduled for March 24, 2009 (AE C). He\nhopes to have the child support lowered from $3,000 a month to a more reasonable\namount based on his current salary (Tr. 34). Applicant has been working on this\nmodification process since fall 2008 (AE C).\nIn 2008, Applicant asked his exwife to work with him without Court involvement.\nHe wanted to reduce the amount of support to $1,300 a month because he was not\nmaking enough income due to a lower paying job. She would not agree. He was still\npaying the health insurance from his retirement income. \nThe SOR alleged delinquent debts/collection accounts totaling approximately\n$98,000. The credit bureau reports confirm the amounts owed (GE 2).\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant and his wife filed jointly in June\n2002. The bankruptcy ($93,622.60) was discharged in September 2002.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a judgment in the amount of $6,025. Applicant admits this is not\npaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account in the amount of $103. Applicant admits this is\nnot paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a collection account in the amount of $104. Applicant admits this is\nnot paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off account in the amount of $305. Applicant admits this\nis not paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a charged-off account in the amount of $8,391. Applicant denied\nowing this because he had no knowledge of the account. He believes his wife opened\nthe account when they were separated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a charged-off account in the amount of $952 that is not paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a charged-off account in the amount of $7,377. Applicant admits\nthis debt and acknowledges that it is not paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a charged-off account in the amount of $817. Applicant admits this\naccount is not paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a collection account for $17,896. This has been removed from\nApplicant\u2019s credit report. This account was included in Applicant\u2019s 2002 bankruptcy\n(GE.)\nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a collection account in the amount of $4,311. Applicant denies this\naccount. This is unpaid.\n\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a child/family support account that is 120 days delinquent in the\namount of $24,459. Applicant denied this allegation because the amount is incorrect.\nSOR \u00b6 1.m is another child/family support delinquent account in the amount of\n$16,660. Applicant denies this allegation because the amount is incorrect. He owes less\nthan this amount. Applicant believes the total amount for the two child/family support\naccounts is $30,767. He produced documentation showing one account number and the\namount owed (AE A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.n is for an auto loan charged-off in the amount of $1,335. Applicant\nadmits that this account is not paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a collection account in the amount of $7,688. Applicant disputed\nthis account to the credit bureau because he had no knowledge of it. It is unpaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.p is a collection account in the amount of $94. Applicant denied this\naccount.\nSOR \u00b61.q is a collection account in the amount of $1,906. Applicant admits this\naccount is not paid.\nWhen Applicant learned about the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, he\nresearched his credit report. He disputed some accounts because he believed they\nwere in his 2002 bankruptcy. He also did not know about many of the accounts that\nwere opened online by his wife. He contacted creditors/collection agents and tried to\ntrack the original debt.\nApplicant earns $20 an hour. He does not usually earn overtime. His Navy\nretirement is approximately $1,450 gross (Tr. 50). After monthly expenses and payment\non some debt, he has approximately $50 net remainder (Tr. 53). He is current with his\ncar payment and daily expenses. He recently paid off a personal loan (Tr. 18). He has\nnot been able to pay the $3,000 a month for child/family support payments for a period\nof time. He has gone further into arrears.\nApplicant remarried in 2008 and his wife is employed. She earns approximately\n$15 an hour. He does not use credit cards. He received financial counseling in 2007. He\ndoes not want to file for bankruptcy again. \nApplicant\u2019s annual performance appraisals rate him as \u201cabove standards\u201d with\n\u201cgreatly exceeds standards\u201d in several areas. The appraisals note that he displays\nsuperb management skills and his performance is marked by integrity and initiative (AE\nB). \nApplicant was entrusted with a $624,000 budget and saved his command money.\nHe has been trusted with classified information during his entire career and has not had\n\n5\nany adverse incidents. He has an ability to remain unflustered during frenzied periods at\nwork. He is an asset to his team and described as an exceptional team player who is\nready for positions of greater scope and trust. \nApplicant\u2019s commanding officer described him as an exceptionally outstanding\nprofessional. He works long, hard hours at considerable personal sacrifice. This attests\nto his reliability, maturity and high level of dedication to his work. He has received\nvarious awards, medals, and letters of commendation in recognition of his\nachievements (AE B).\nApplicant\u2019s plan to pay his delinquent debt is to use extra money from any\nreduction in child/family support. He also hopes to contest the arrears that he believes\nare not correct. He is not certain if he can legally contest the child support arrears. He\nhas received conflicting information on this issue (Tr. 41). He will pay the smaller debts\nfirst. He also acknowledged that he may think about bankruptcy due to the substantial\namount of delinquent debt (Tr. 50).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n6\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy in 2002 because they\ncould not pay their delinquent debts. Since that time, Applicant incurred more delinquent\ndebt. He is in arrears for family/child support in the amount of $30,767. His total\ndelinquent debt is approximately $50,000. He was not able to pay his financial\nobligations from 2006 until the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\n\n7\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries are partially the result of allowing his credit to be used by\nhis wife. While Applicant was deployed on active duty, his wife would spend and\nperhaps live beyond her means. However he and his wife filed for bankruptcy in 2002\nand a significant amount of debt is still unresolved in 2009. This potentially mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems may have been exacerbated by his ex-wife. Applicant\u2019s separation\nand divorce caused family and child support payments. Applicant admitted that they had\nlarge credit card debt and bought a house. Applicant and his wife were overwhelmed\nfinancially. His separation and divorce exacerbated the problem. Applicant\u2019s pay\ndecreased when he retired. Applicant did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving\nhis debts after the 2002 bankruptcy. He did not take an active stance when he learned\nabout many of them. I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has received financial counseling in\nthe past. He is paying child support through a garnishment. He does not have a handle\non his financial affairs at this time. He plans to pay his delinquent debt but has no firm\nplan in place at this time. He hopes to have the child/family support amount modified so\nthat he has money to pay some debts. This mitigating condition partially applies.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant filed\nbankruptcy in 2002 which is a legal means to resolve debt. He paid several small debts\nnot alleged on the SOR and one of the debts was included in his 2002 bankruptcy but\nthe majority are unresolved. He was paying child/family support but is in arrears at this\npoint. I conclude this mitigating condition partially applies.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebts were due to his wife not paying on accounts while he was deployed and creating\nmore credit accounts that he had no knowledge about. He has disputed some of them.\nHe is responsible for them. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not\napply.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is not sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant served in the military for 20 years and retired. He has an exemplary\nwork record. He received many awards, citations and achievements. He held a security\nclearance for his entire career with no adverse incidents. He is a valuable and trusted\nemployee. He received outstanding evaluations.\nApplicant\u2019s marriage, separation and divorce created many of his financial\nproblems. However, he admitted that he and his wife overextended themselves and\nlived on credit cards for a period of time. They filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The divorce\nand family/child support payments and Applicant\u2019s reduced income have left him unable\nto pay his delinquent debts. He is attempting to reduce his support payments. He has a\nhearing in March 2009. Applicant plans to pay his smaller debts first after he has his\nsupport payments reduced. However, he is still in arrears and has a substantial amount\nof delinquent debt. He has not provided sufficient mitigation to sustain his burden in this\ncase.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that two federal tax liens were filed against Applicant in 2005 for federal tax debts of $28,437.45 (SOR 1.a) and $24,717.36 (SOR 1.b), which had not been paid as of October 2008; that he owed delinquent consumer debts totaling $2,177.44 (SOR 1.c-1.f) and mortgage loan debt totaling $449,000 (SOR 1.g-1.h); that he had $56,125 in gambling losses during tax year 2004 (SOR 1.i); and that he was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in about November 2000 (SOR 1.j). Applicant\u2019s gambling loss was cross-alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct (SOR 2.a). Also under Guideline E, DOHA alleged that Applicant falsified his April 2008 security clearance application by failing to report the tax liens (SOR 2.b) and delinquent mortgage loans (SOR 2.c-2.d). Applicant submitted a response in which he indicated that he filed amended tax returns to the IRS, owed the creditor in SOR 1.c $300 rather than $597.44, received a release from the mortgage debt in SOR 1.g, had been in forbearance and not foreclosure of the mortgage loan in SOR 1.h, and he won money gambling in 2004. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old structural draftsman apprentice, who has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2008 (Exs. 1, A, Tr. 51-52). From January 2000 to April 2008, he had been self-employed as a subcontractor mortgage Applicant has ",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nBetween July 2002 and October 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed\nliens totaling $88,698 against Applicant for nonpayment of taxes. The most recent lien\nof about $53,154 covers tax years 2003 and 2004, when Applicant was gambling\nheavily, and it has not been released. In 2007, he defaulted on two mortgage loans.\nWhile he averted foreclosure of his home by modifying or refinancing his primary\nmortgage, the lender of his second mortgage wrote off its loan. Applicant continues to\nignore some consumer credit delinquencies, and he was not fully candid about his\nfinancial problems when he applied for his security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 14, 2008. On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal\nconduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security\nclearance and to refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n2\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn March 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On\nMay 12, 2009, Applicant resubmitted his Answer, apparently clarifying his response to\none or more allegations at DOHA\u2019s request (Tr. 10). The case was assigned to me on\nJune 30, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On\nAugust 11, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for September 16, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Six government exhibits (Exs. 1-6) were\nadmitted into evidence without any objections. Applicant testified and submitted one\nexhibit (Ex. A) that was entered into the record without any objections, as reflected in a\ntranscript (Tr.) received on September 25, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open for one week for additional\ndocumentation. On September 22, 2009, Applicant forwarded a written statement (Ex.\nB) and financial records (Exs. C-G), which were admitted without any objections.  On\nSeptember 28, 2009, the government moved in rebuttal for the admission of four IRS\npublications. Applicant filed no objections by the October 9, 2009, due date, and the\ndocuments were admitted as government exhibits (Exs. 7-10).\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that two federal tax\nliens were filed against Applicant in 2005 for federal tax debts of $28,437.45 (SOR 1.a)\nand $24,717.36 (SOR 1.b), which had not been paid as of October 2008; that he owed\ndelinquent consumer debts totaling $2,177.44 (SOR 1.c-1.f) and mortgage loan debt\ntotaling $449,000 (SOR 1.g-1.h); that he had $56,125 in gambling losses during tax\nyear 2004 (SOR 1.i); and that he was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in\nabout November 2000 (SOR 1.j). Applicant\u2019s gambling loss was cross-alleged under\nGuideline E, personal conduct (SOR 2.a). Also under Guideline E, DOHA alleged that\nApplicant falsified his April 2008 security clearance application by failing to report the tax\nliens (SOR 2.b) and delinquent mortgage loans (SOR 2.c-2.d). Applicant submitted a\nresponse in which he indicated that he filed amended tax returns to the IRS, owed the\ncreditor in SOR 1.c $300 rather than $597.44, received a release from the mortgage\ndebt in SOR 1.g, had been in forbearance and not foreclosure of the mortgage loan in\nSOR 1.h, and he won money gambling in 2004. After considering the pleadings,\nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old structural draftsman apprentice, who has been\nemployed by a defense contractor since April 2008 (Exs. 1, A, Tr. 51-52). From\nJanuary 2000 to April 2008, he had been self-employed as a subcontractor mortgage\n\nApplicant has a history of failing to file timely returns, including for 2004 and 2007, and perhaps 2005\n1\nand 2006 as well (Tr. 26, 41, 43-44, 59), that could have led the IRS to file substitute returns and assess\npenalties.\nDOHA alleged that federal tax liens were filed in July 2005 (SOR 1.a) and May 2005 (SOR 1.b).\n2\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports (Exs. 4, 5, 6) show a $53,154 lien filed in October 2006, which would correspond\nto the total tax debt alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b.\nIt is unclear how Applicant arrived at these figures. Applicant submits that due to $56,125 in gambling\n3\nlosses, he had zero adjusted gross wages for 2004 and therefore does not owe the IRS $53,154. Neither the\nwin/loss statement from the casino reporting losses of $92,947 for 2004 (Ex. D), nor the form 1099-MISC\nshowing $600 in income for that same year (Ex. F), substantiates his claim that his losses cancelled out his\nincome for federal tax purposes for 2004.\n3\nbroker for a couple of mortgage companies, including one firm owned by his first cousin\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 49, 55).\nIn August 2000, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to relieve himself of the\nlegal responsibility to repay between $8,000 and $9,000 in medical debt following a\ncommercial construction accident (Tr. 65). He was granted a discharge in November\n2000 (SOR 1.j) (Exs. 5, 6).\nWhether due to inaccurate calculation of taxes owed due to his independent\ncontracting, failure to file required returns, or some other cause, Applicant had a history\nof underpayment of federal income taxes that led the IRS to file liens against him.  In\n1\nJuly 2002, the IRS filed a tax lien against him in the amount of $5,891, for unpaid taxes\nof $3,806 for 1998 and $2,085 for 2000 (Tr. 60), which he satisfied in July 2004 (Ex. 4).\nIn February 2004, the IRS filed a tax lien against him in the amount of $29,655, for\nunpaid taxes of $8,968 for 2001 and $20,687 for 2002, which he satisfied in July 2006\n(Ex. 4, Tr. 59, 61).\nIn October 2006, the IRS filed a tax lien against him in the amount of $53,154\n(Exs. 4, 5), for unpaid federal income tax debts of $28,437.45 for tax year 2003 (SOR\n1.a) and $24,717.36 for tax year 2004 (SOR 1.b) (Exs. 4, 5, 6, Tr. 62).  The company\n2\nfor which Applicant worked as an independent contractor in 2004 reported to the IRS\nthat Applicant had nonemployee compensation of $95,695.36 for 2004 (Ex. C), and W-2\nearnings totaling $7,615.41 (Ex. E). After the lien was filed, Applicant sought the\nassistance of his father, who expressed concern that Applicant was paying too much in\ntaxes (Tr. 59). In about March 2008, Applicant\u2019s father prepared an amended return for\nhim for tax year 2004 (Ex. 2). On his amended state and federal returns, Applicant\nreported previously undisclosed gambling losses of $56,125, on adjusted gross income\nof $56,125 (SOR 1.i), leaving him with no taxable income.  Based on these amended\n3\nfigures, Applicant calculated that he owed state taxes of $2,096 but was entitled to a\n$432 federal tax refund for tax year 2004 (Ex. 2).\nIn October 2005, Applicant bought his home, taking out a primary mortgage loan\nof $280,000 (SOR 1.h) and a second mortgage loan of $170,000 (SOR 1.g). In 2007,\nApplicant stopped paying his mortgage loans (Tr. 67), and they fell into default. In April\n2007, the servicer for the second mortgage issued a 1099-C, indicating $0 of the debt\n\nApplicant testified that he made payments on a monthly basis, but that he could have been \u201ca little\n4\nlate here and there\u201d (Tr. 73). His credit report of October 14, 2008, shows a past due balance of $18,711 on\nthe loan. He presented no documentation showing that he made the $27,733.93 payment in May 2008\nrequired by the forbearance agreement, although he subsequently managed to avert foreclosure by actions\ntaken in 2009.\n4\nhad been cancelled (Ex. 3). The lender did not actively pursue the debt, but continued\nto report past due balances on Applicant\u2019s credit reports (Exs. 4, 5, 6). Foreclosure\nproceedings were initiated on his primary mortgage. With his mortgage $18,410.01 in\narrears, Applicant entered into a forbearance agreement with the servicer of his primary\nmortgage in February 2008. Applicant agreed to pay $28,956.73 to rehabilitate the loan\nas follows: $3,402 on or before February 11, 2008, $2,161.88 on or before March 11,\n2008, $2,161.88 on April 11, 2008, and $27,733.93 on May 11, 2008 (Ex. 2). Applicant\nmade some payments, but he was behind $15,309 on his loan as of April 2008 (Ex. 4).4\nBy December 2007, Applicant was seriously behind in his $694 monthly car\npayment on a loan taken out in February 2004 for $32,707 (Ex. 5). His car was\nrepossessed (Ex. 1), but he redeemed the vehicle within a few weeks by paying $3,200\n(Tr. 78, 80-81). His loan was current for only a short time. As of April 2008, he was 60\ndays past due in his car payment (Ex. 5).\nIn April 2008, Applicant began a five-year apprenticeship program to become a\nstructural draftsman at this present place of employment (Exs. 1, A, Tr. 92). His starting\nhourly wage was $13.33 (Tr. 51). On April 14, 2008, he completed an e-QIP for a\nsecret-level security clearance (Tr. 93). He listed only the vehicle repossession in\nDecember 2007 in response to inquiries into his financial record. He responded\nnegatively to question 27.c, concerning whether a lien had been placed against his\nproperty in the last seven years for failing to pay taxes or other debts. He also answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to questions 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)?\u201d and 28.b, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\n(Ex. 1). Applicant testified at his hearing that he did not disclose the IRS tax liens or tax\ndebts because he did not believe he owed delinquent federal taxes based on his\nrecently prepared amended return (Tr. 78), and because he had satisfied past tax debts\nto release earlier tax liens (Tr. 79). When asked about his failure to report any financial\ndelinquencies, Applicant cited the forbearance agreement, which was to bring the\nprimary mortgage current, and he indicated he had been unaware of any credit card\ndelinquency (Tr. 79-80).\nAs of April 2008, Applicant had not satisfied or resolved the $53,154 federal tax\nlien. In addition to being late in his car payments, he owed past due balances of about\n$1,000 on a MasterCard account charged off in December 2006 and in collection (SOR\n1.f), $426 on a closed checking account (SOR 1.e), and $124 on a credit card account\ninactive since April 2002 (SOR 1.d) (Ex. 4).  In about January 2008, a plumber filed a\nmechanic\u2019s lien of almost $600 against Applicant for nonpayment of services provided\nin July and August 2007. On May 19, 2008, Applicant paid the plumber $300, reducing\nthe past due balance to $322.39 (Ex. G, Tr. 73-75). Applicant disputes the lien because\nof his payment in May 2008, but he has not attempted to resolve the issue (Tr. 75).\n\nApplicant considers the debt to be resolved since the lender wrote it off (Tr. 29).\n5\nApplicant testified that he filed an extension for payment of income taxes for 2008, but he cannot\n6\nrecall the amount owed (Tr. 42).\n5\nOn June 5, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis delinquent financial accounts and the federal tax lien. Applicant disputed the lien and\nclaimed that as a self-employed broker from 2000 to January 2008, he filed yearly\nincome tax returns and paid taxes on his income. Yet, he acknowledged that he had\nbeen notified by the IRS in 2006 about $83,000 in delinquent federal income tax debt\ncovering a four-year span. Applicant claimed that amended returns showed no money\nowed. Applicant acknowledged one delinquent credit card debt (SOR 1.f) on which he\nowed at least $1,000 due to interest. He indicated he would contact the lender and\nresolve the matter. As for his delinquent mortgages, Applicant explained that his second\nmortgage had been placed for collection due to him not earning enough to make the\npayments, but his account had been closed and the balance written off.  Applicant\n5\nindicated that he was in the process of modifying his primary mortgage (Ex. 3).\nBy October 2008, Applicant had brought his car loan current, but his primary\nmortgage was $18,711 past due and again in the process of foreclosure (Ex. 5).\nApplicant subsequently refinanced his primary mortgage in late spring 2009, taking out\na conventional 30-year mortgage loan of $322,000, to be repaid at $2,400 monthly (Ex.\n6, Tr. 69-72), but he made no effort to address his other known debts or to verify the\ndebt in SOR 1.d that he was unsure about (Tr. 31). As of June 2009, he owed $1,197\non the delinquent credit card account in SOR 1.f, was reportedly $59,000 past due on\nthe defaulted second mortgage, owed a collection balance of $546 on another account\n(likely SOR 1.e), was $1,000 past due in his car payment, and had not yet resolved his\nIRS debts covered by the October 2006 lien (Ex. 6). In August 2009, the IRS began\ngarnishing his wages at $130 per week to repay a $6,000 federal tax debt for a tax year\nthat Applicant claimed to not recall (Tr. 27, 56-57, 64). As of his hearing in mid-\nSeptember 2009, Applicant had not filed his federal or state income tax returns for tax\nyear 2007 (Tr.41), and he provided no reason for his failure to do so (Tr. 43). He was\nnot sure whether he had filed returns for tax years 2005 (Tr. 44) or 2006 (Tr. 43).\nApplicant filed his returns for 2008. He owes federal taxes for that year as well (Tr. 42).6\nApplicant has gambled (slots, video poker) once at a casino in the last couple of\nyears, likely in early 2009. He took $100 or $200 with him and came home with $300 on\nthat occasion (Tr. 40-41).\nAs of September 2009, Applicant\u2019s hourly wage in the apprenticeship program\nwas $15.95 (Tr. 51). Available monthly performance reviews indicate he was doing\ngood work and his attendance was within company guidelines (Ex. A). Since April or\nMay 2008, he has also worked a second job as a bartender at a local restaurant (Tr. 53-\n54). His compensation there is largely dependent on tips, although he is paid a small\nhourly wage (Tr. 54).\n\n6\nApplicant has been married since September 2008. As of September 2009,\nApplicant\u2019s spouse was handling the bills. He did not maintain an open checking\naccount or a savings account (Tr. 83), and his pay was being deposited into his\nspouse\u2019s account. Applicant did not know whether they had any funds remaining after\ntheir monthly bills were paid (Tr. 85), or whether his spouse had delinquent debt of her\nown on which she was making payments (Tr. 94). No evidence was presented to\nindicate the extent of her financial contributions to the household.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\n\nApplicant reported gambling winnings (Form W -2G) of $56,125 equal to reported losses of $56,125\n7\n(Ex. 2). According to IRS Topic 419 on gambling income and losses, a payer is required to issue a Form W -2G\nfor certain gambling winnings or if any gambling winnings are subject to federal income tax withholding.\nGambling losses may be an itemized deduction, but the amount of loss deducted may not be more than the\namount of gambling income reported on the return (Exs. 7-10). Based on the casino win/loss statement,\nApplicant\u2019s gambling losses exceeded his winnings at that casino, but he is not entitled to claim the entire loss.\n7\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has a record of income tax delinquency and of repeated failure to file\ntimely tax returns when he was a self-employed broker. Federal tax liens were filed\nagainst him in July 2002 for $5,890, in February 2004 for $29,654, and in October 2006\nfor $53,154. As of September 2009, his wages were being garnished to repay $6,000 in\ndelinquent federal taxes for a tax year that he cannot now recall, and he owes back\ntaxes for 2008 that he had not yet started to repay. Applicant also defaulted on his\nmortgage loans in 2007, and he fell seriously delinquent on a few consumer credit debts\n(SOR 1.c-1.f). His inability to remain current on his financial obligations, especially after\nhe had been afforded a fresh start through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2000,\nraises serious doubts about his financial judgment. AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d clearly\napply.\nThere is credible evidence that would implicate casino gambling as a negative\ninfluence on Applicant\u2019s financial situation in 2004. The win/loss record of the local\ncasino indicates a loss of $92,647.00 from slot machines alone. Applicant reported on\nhis amended income tax return for 2004 that he had gambling losses of $56,125.7\nWhether or not he could cover his gambling losses with his job income and winnings, it\nwas financially irresponsible of him to gamble to such an extent when he owed\ndelinquent federal taxes. He did not pay his $29,654 tax debt for 2001 and 2002 until\nJuly 2006, despite a federal tax lien. AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to\ndrug abuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues of security concern,\u201d\napplies.\n\nGambling winnings are fully taxable and must be reported on one\u2019s tax return (Ex. 8).\n8\n8\nFurthermore, although not alleged as raising a separate concern under Guideline\nF, Applicant had not filed his federal or state returns for tax year 2007 (Tr. 41). He is\nuncertain whether he filed for 2005 or 2006. Even assuming those returns were filed,\nAG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required\nor the fraudulent filing of the same,\u201d still applies, given his failure to file his 2007 returns\nand his admitted failure to report his gambling wins and losses on his 2004 return.8\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably apply in light of the extent and recency of his\nfinancial problems. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in that medical debt led\nApplicant to file for bankruptcy in 2000. But AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate the poor\nfinancial decisions that led to his present financial situation. He gambled beyond what\nhe could reasonably afford and failed to comply with the laws concerning the timely\nfiling of tax returns and payment of taxes owed.\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d applies in only limited part. Applicant has a credible dispute about the balance of\nthe mechanic\u2019s lien (SOR 1.c) in that he paid $300 to reduce the balance on his account\nto $322.39 as of mid-May 2008. Applicant\u2019s challenge to any current liability for his\ndefaulted second mortgage (SOR 1.g) is based on a 1099-C form for tax year 2007\nissued by the lender around the time that the primary mortgagee initiated foreclosure\nproceedings. The amount of the cancelled debt was listed as $0 on the 1099-C, and the\ncreditor continues to report the account as delinquent on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. Yet,\nthere is no evidence that the creditor has attempted to collect the debt, which it wrote off\nin April 2007. While Applicant may not be required to repay the debt, it does not fall\nsquarely into AG \u00b6 20(e) since it was a legitimate obligation that he allowed to fall into\ndefault. Applicant still does not recognize the debt in SOR 1.d, which was listed on his\ncredit record, but he did not provide any documentation to substantiate his dispute.\nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s amended return for tax year 2004 is insufficient in and of itself\nto prove that he owes no back taxes for 2003 and 2004. Even if the IRS eventually\nreduces his federal tax liability for 2004 because of his gambling losses, Applicant\nprovided no credible evidence to rebut the IRS assessment of $28,437.45 in delinquent\ntaxes for tax year 2003.\nAlthough his mortgage defaults reflect adversely on his judgment and reliability,\nApplicant is credited with working with his primary mortgage lender to avert foreclosure.\nHe also satisfied tax liens filed against him in 2002 and 2004 for nonpayment of federal\n\n9\ntaxes in 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2002. But it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d or AG \u00b6 20(d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d He has not resolved the federal tax lien for nonpayment of taxes alleged\nin SOR 1.a and 1.b. He has taken no action to arrange for repayment of his consumer\ncredit delinquencies. Since his marriage in September 2008, he has continued to have\ndifficulty meeting some of his financial obligations on time. He was behind in his primary\nmortgage as recently as March 2009, although he subsequently refinanced or modified\nthe loan. As of June 2009, he had again fallen behind in his car payments. In August\n2009, the IRS began garnishing his wages to recover back taxes of about $6,000.\nConcerns persist that he may not be able to fully cover his ongoing monthly expenses,\nincluding $130 per week to the IRS, $694 per month for his car, and $2,400 per month\nfor his mortgage. He has not begun repaying federal taxes owed for 2008. The financial\nconcerns are not fully mitigated, even though he deserves credit for limiting his casino\ngambling to only once in the last couple of years.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exercised poor judgment within the context of AG \u00b6 15 when he\ngambled heavily while ignoring his obligation to pay delinquent federal taxes. AG \u00b6\n16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding,\u201d must be considered. Applicant\u2019s casino losses for 2004 amounted to $92,947\nwhen he had a $29,654 federal tax lien against him.\nThe government also alleged deliberate falsification of his security clearance\napplication in April 2008 because Applicant did not disclose the latest tax lien (SOR 2.b)\nand his mortgage defaults (SOR 2.c-2.d). When he was interviewed in June 2008,\nApplicant denied knowing of the tax lien, although he admitted he had been notified by\nthe IRS in 2006 that he owed four years of back taxes. He claimed that he had filed\namended returns showing he owed no taxes (Ex. 3). At his hearing, Applicant attributed\nhis negative response to the lien inquiry (27.c, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien\nplaced against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d), to his belief that\nhe did not owe any taxes based on the amended return (Tr. 78). He had satisfied the\ntaxes to release the earlier tax liens (Tr. 79). Applicant did not indicate at his hearing\n\n10\nthat he had been unaware of the October 2006 lien, but the evidence falls short of\nestablishing that he acted to conceal that tax lien when he completed his e-QIP.\nOn the other hand, he knew that he had paid more than $30,000 to the IRS\nwithin the last seven years to satisfy delinquent taxes. An affirmative response to\nquestion 28.a (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d) was clearly required. Applicant\u2019s amended return showing he was entitled to\na refund of federal taxes could extenuate his failure to list any tax debt for 2004 in\nresponse to question 28.b (\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d). But it could not reasonably justify his omission of the tax delinquency for\n2003 from 28.a and 28.b. Applicant\u2019s overall credibility suffers because of his failure to\ndisclose his tax delinquencies on his e-QIP.\nFurthermore, the facts support a finding of knowing concealment of his defaulted\nmortgage loans. Applicant explained that the forbearance agreement was supposed to\nbring his primary mortgage current, and he was taking care of the situation (Tr. 79-80).\nUnder the terms of the February 2008 forbearance agreement, which covered only his\nprimary mortgage, the loan servicer agreed to forbear from pursuing the foreclosure\nproceedings and give Applicant time to cure the default by making payments totaling\n$28,956.73. Applicant has not shown that his loan was out of default status as of his e-\nQIP in April 2008. Also, whether or not the holder of his second mortgage had written off\nthe balance of its loan in April 2007, Applicant knew he had been behind more than 180\ndays on that debt within the last seven years. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d is implicated. A person\nreviewing Applicant\u2019s e-QIP would have no reason to know that he had financial\nproblems beyond a car repossession in 2007.\nApplicant was not completely forthcoming about his tax situation when he was\ninterviewed in June 2008. He claimed that he had filed yearly income tax returns and\npaid taxes on income earned. Concerning the notification of tax delinquency from the\nIRS in 2006, Applicant averred that he filed amended returns and owed no taxes. Yet,\nhe admitted at his hearing that he has not filed for tax year 2007 and perhaps 2005 and\n2006 as well. He did not volunteer to the government investigator any information about\nprevious tax liens or his satisfaction of delinquent tax debts in 2004 and 2006. Although\nApplicant discussed his mortgage loan defaults with the investigator, I am unable to\napply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts,\u201d because of his lack of full candor about his tax situation.\nAG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n11\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d are not pertinent in light\nof Applicant\u2019s failure to appreciate the importance of providing true and complete\ninformation during the security clearance process. Applicant has curtailed his gaming\nactivities in the past couple of years, so AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d must\nbe considered, but it does not fully mitigate the personal conduct concerns generated by\nhis excessive gambling when he had not complied with his federal income tax\nobligations.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n Between July 2002 and October 2006, the IRS filed liens totaling $88,698\nagainst him for nonpayment of taxes. The most recent lien of about $53,154 covers tax\nyears 2003 and 2004, when Applicant was gambling heavily, and it has not been\nreleased. In 2007, he defaulted on two mortgage loans. While he averted foreclosure of\nhis home by modifying or refinancing his primary mortgage, he took no steps to cure the\ndefault of his second mortgage. He continues to ignore some consumer credit\ndelinquencies of which he has had notice since June 2008, if not before. Applicant listed\nno current financial delinquencies on his security clearance application. His work for the\ndefense contractor has been satisfactory. However, concerns about his financial\nsituation, and whether he can be counted on to comply with his tax obligations and\nthose expected of persons granted a security clearance, preclude me from finding that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance at this\ntime.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On October 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) which \nwere effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 10, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n7, 2010. The case was assigned to me on January 15, 2010. On March 1, 2010, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for March 23, 2010. The hearing \nwas held, as scheduled. The Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4 without objection. The Applicant testified and offered \neight exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - H. The transcript (Tr.)  \nJune 2, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas received on April 1, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR pursuant to \nparagraph E3.1.17 of the Directive. Applicant did not object to the motion to amend. (Tr. \n60-63) \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a(1) was amended to read as follows: \u201c(1) marijuana \u2013 about 1000 \ntimes, at times including daily use, from 1998 to July 2008;\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a(6) was added which reads: \u201c(6) hallucinogenic mushrooms \n(psilocybin) on multiple occasions between 1999 and 2008.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d was added which reads: \u201cd. You operated a motor vehicle while \nimpaired or intoxicated by alcohol on two occasions in 2009.\u201d  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations including the \namendments to the SOR.  \n \nApplicant is a 26 year old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  She is a licensing analyst and has worked for her current \nemployer since December 2007. Applicant has a bachelor of science degree in \npackaging science. This is her first time applying for a security clearance. She is \nengaged to be married and has no children.  (Tr. 4-5, 26-27, 55; Gov 1)   \n \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug abuse beginning when she was in high \nschool. She began to use marijuana at age 15. She estimates that between 1998 and \nJuly 2008, she used marijuana 1,000 times. She smoked marijuana on a daily basis \nduring the first four years of college. In 2006, she moved back home and would only \nsmoke about three to four days a week. She stopped smoking marijuana in October \n2007 when she began interviewing for jobs. She last used marijuana in July 2008, \nseven months after completing her application for a security clearance. Applicant was at \na concert with some friends and they smoked marijuana and took hallucinogenic \nmushrooms (psilocybin). Her July 2008 marijuana use was the only time she used \nmarijuana after being hired by her current employer. (Tr. 25, 33; Gov 1; Gov 2)  \n \nBetween 1998 and 2008, Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms about ten \ntimes. Applicant first tried ecstasy in 2000 while still a high school student. She used \necstasy approximately 60 times between January 2003 and January 2005. Applicant \nused to attend rave parties and ecstasy was the substance of choice. (Tr. 35, 39; Gov 1; \nGov 2) Between January 2001 and January 2002, she used LSD on at least three \noccasions. (Tr. 39-40; Gov 1, section 24) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant used cocaine approximately 60 times between November 2006 and \nNovember 2007. She befriended a cocaine dealer. She purchased cocaine a couple \ntimes. In 2007, Applicant tested positive for cocaine use during a pre-employment drug \ntest. The company withdrew their employment offer. The last time Applicant used \ncocaine was around Thanksgiving 2007 when her friends threw her a farewell party \nbefore she moved to begin her current job.  (Tr. 36-38, 46-47, 54; Gov 2) \n \nApplicant admits to being aware that her drug use was illegal. She was also \naware of her current employer\u2019s policy prohibiting illegal drug use. She claims that she \nused illegal drugs after applying for a security clearance because she was stupid and \nimmature. (Tr. 41-42, 47) \n \nApplicant considers herself to be an alcoholic. During her background \ninvestigation interview on May 6, 2008, Applicant indicated that she started to drink \nalcohol while in high school. She would drink several times a week to the point of \nintoxication. She becomes violent when she becomes intoxicated. She told the \ninvestigator that she wanted to stop drinking, but took no steps to do anything about it \nas of the date of the interview. (Tr.  45; Gov 2) \n \nOn two occasions, Applicant was arrested and charged with Domestic Assault \nafter getting into a physical argument with her then boyfriend. She was intoxicated on \nboth occasions when she was arrested. In December 2007, after a night of drinking at a \nbar, Applicant and her boyfriend got into an argument at another couple\u2019s apartment. \nThey left the apartment and continued fighting in the parking lot of the apartment \ncomplex. They realized the police would be called so they got into a car and began to \nleave. The police detained them before they could leave. Applicant was charged with \nDomestic Assault. Her boyfriend was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe charges against Applicant were dismissed because her boyfriend refused to testify \nagainst her. She admits to the conduct even though the charges were dropped. (Tr. 28; \nGov 1, section 23; Gov 2; Gov 3) \n \nOn April 14, 2008, Applicant got into a fight with her boyfriend at their apartment. \nShe was intoxicated. The neighbors called the police. Applicant\u2019s boyfriend told the \npolice that she had physically assaulted him. The police noticed red marks on her \nboyfriend\u2019s face. Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault by Contact - Family \nViolence. On June 11, 2008, Applicant received a deferred sentence. She was given the \nchoice to pay a $515 fine or complete an anger management course. She chose to \ncomplete the anger management course and completed the course on October 2, 2008. \n(Tr. 28; Gov 2)     \n   \nIn her answers to interrogatories dated January 12, 2009, Applicant indicated the \nanger management classes allowed her to explore her codependency issues with \nalcohol. She admitted that she was still drinking. She has only gone to bars about twice \na month since July 2008. She only had one to two drinks each time. She indicated that \n\n \n4 \n \n \nshe did not buy alcohol to drink at home, and that she does not drink in her house. (Gov \n2) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that she did not realize the severity of her \nalcohol problem. Three events made her realize the seriousness of her problem. On the \nfirst occasion, she blacked out after driving home from a bar in the winter of 2009.  The \nsecond event was when she made a fool of herself when she was out drinking with \nfriends and coworkers. Her breaking point was on May 2, 2009. She was drinking at a \ncoworker\u2019s concert. She became upset and anxious and drove herself to a hospital and \nchecked herself into the hospital.  She was treated for depression, anxiety, and alcohol \nand drug addiction for three days. During her stay in the hospital she received \ncounseling from a psychiatrist and attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. She \ndid not attend AA meetings after she left the hospital. (Tr. 22, 47) \n \nWhen Applicant was hospitalized, she claims that she was treated for \ndepression. She is not aware of being diagnosed with substance abuse or alcohol \nabuse. Her drug and alcohol issues never interfered with her work. She provided a copy \nof her college transcripts which reveal that she had a good grade point average. (Tr. 20, \n29; AE A) \n \nAfter she was released from the hospital, she found a Christian counselor and \nattended several therapy sessions. She also became active in the singles group of her \nchurch home. Her church helped her commit to a more sober life style. She has not \ndrank alcohol since May 2, 2009. She takes no prescription medication and is doing \nwell. She no longer associates with her drug using friends. She took a voluntary drug \ntest on November 6, 2009, which tested negative for illegal drugs. (Tr. 23-25; AE D; AE \nE; AE G; AE H)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant provided a written statement indicating that she has \nbeen sober since May 3, 2009, and she does not intend to consume alcoholic \nbeverages in the future. (AE D) She also provided a written statement that she has not \nused illegal drugs since July 21, 2008, and she does not intend to use illegal drugs in \nthe future. She has disassociated herself from her friends who use illegal drugs and \nalcohol. (AE H) \n \nThe leader of the singles group at Applicant\u2019s church wrote a letter on her behalf. \nHe and his wife met Applicant in 2008 when they started the group. Applicant attended \ntheir meetings regularly. Applicant was one of their most faithful attendees and was an \nintegral part of the church group. Applicant confided that she wanted to separate herself \nfrom the mistakes of her past. He and his wife can attest to her change of heart and life. \n(AE F at 1) \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker wrote a letter on her behalf indicating that she met \nApplicant in February 2009 when she began her employment at the same company. \nApplicant showed her around and introduced her to the other coworkers. They joined an \nintramural softball league. They went to happy hour on a few occasions. She observed \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthat alcohol did not always have the best effects on Applicant. Applicant\u2019s mood would \nchange in a negative way and she did not seem to know when to stop drinking. They \neventually became good friends and Applicant confided to her that she did not like how \nshe acted after drinking alcohol. Applicant told her that she was going to quit drinking \nalcohol in May 2009.  The co-worker has not seen her drink alcohol since that time. To \navoid drinking, Applicant would go home after softball games. Her co-worker says that \nApplicant has changed and her overall happiness and quality of life is greatly improved. \n(AE F at 2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister wrote a letter indicating Applicant first revealed her struggles \nwith substance abuse in early 2008. Once Applicant admitted that she had a problem, \nher life began to improve incrementally. She was willing to take steps necessary to \novercome her problems. She sought help from her family, home church, and from a \nprofessional therapist. She avoided friendships and situations that previously \ncompromised her decision to live productively. Her sister says with great confidence \nthat Applicant has achieved a level of stability and integrity. (AE F at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance reports from 2008 and 2009 are favorable. (AE B)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered when \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern raised under the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply: \n \nAG & 25(a) (any drug abuse);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use); and  \n \nAG \u00b625(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia). \n \nApplicant abused illegal drugs over a ten year period, often using illegal drugs on \na daily basis. The level of her drug use was not experimental. In 2007, she tested \npositive for cocaine in a pre-employment drug screening.   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement. One mitigating condition potentially applies to  \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \nAG & 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.)  \npotentially applies. Applicant no longer associates with her drug-using friends. She \nbroke up with her boyfriend. She avoids situations where drugs are likely to be used. \nShe has not used illegal drugs since July 2008. She expressed an intent to no longer \nuse illegal drugs.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant appears to meet the application of AG \u00b6 26(b), it does not fully \nmitigate the drug involvement concern based on Applicant\u2019s long history of substance \nabuse. Her statement that she intends to abstain from illegal drug use in the future, \nwhile sincere, is given less weight because she previously stated that she quit using \nillegal drugs in November 2007 only to use again in July 2008. Her illegal drug use in \nJuly 2008 occurred after she submitted her security clearance questionnaire in January \n2008, and after she was interviewed by an investigator in conjunction with her \nbackground investigation in May 2008. Applicant was also aware of her company\u2019s \npolicy prohibiting illegal drug use.   \n \n \nAdditional concerns remain because although Applicant attended some AA \nmeetings when she was hospitalized in May 2009 and subsequent counseling through \nher church, she no longer attends counseling after relocating to another state. She \ntestified that she has family members in the area for support and believes she can \nhandle the situation on her own. Given her history of drug and alcohol abuse, I am not \nconfident that she will be successful in her efforts to remain sober without some \nprofessional help. While I find it encouraging that Applicant has been drug free since \nJuly 2008, I believe more time is needed to prove that Applicant will remain drug free \nbased on the extent of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use, the fact that she abused illegal drugs \nfor over 10 years, and her relapse in July 2008 after applying for a security clearance.   \n \n \nThe drug involvement concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern raised under the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set \nout in AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The following alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s two arrests for \nDomestic Violence in December 2007 and April 2008. On both occasions Applicant got \ninto a physical argument with her boyfriend after a night of drinking. She admits to \ngetting violent when she is intoxicated. Applicant also admits to blacking out while \ndriving home after a night of drinking in the winter of 2009. She admits to driving her car \nwhile on intoxicated on two occasions in 2009 even though she was never arrested for \nthese incidents.  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent) also applies. Applicant admits that she is an alcoholic. When she drinks \nalcohol, she drinks to the point of intoxication. Her co-worker and friend noticed the \nnegative adverse effect alcohol had on Applicant\u2019s personality. Applicant experienced \nseveral incidents where her judgment has been impaired as a result of her drinking \nalcohol. She was arrested on two occasions after arguing with her boyfriend after a \nnight of drinking. In the winter of 2009, she suffered an alcoholic black out while driving \nhome after a night out drinking. She admits to making a fool of herself after a night of \ndrinking with friends and co-workers.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from alcohol consumption. The following mitigating conditions are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment); and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nApplicant admits to having issues with alcohol and believes that she is an \nalcoholic. She has remained alcohol-free since May 2009. However, she currently does \nnot attend alcohol counseling. She initially told the government on her security \nclearance questionnaire that she had not consumed alcohol since December 16, 2007. \nShe eventually resumed drinking alcohol which resulted in her second arrest for \nDomestic Violence in April 2008. Her alcohol use escalated to the point that she blacked \n\n \n9 \n \n \nout while driving home after a night of drinking in winter 2009 and she felt that she made \na fool of herself in front of her co-workers. Not enough time has passed to verify that \nApplicant will maintain her sobriety.  \n \nGuideline G is found against Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nperformance evaluations with her current employer. I considered her favorable \nreference letters. While I believe Applicant is sincere when she states that she intends \nto remain alcohol and drug free, at this time I believe the potential for relapse remains \nbecause Applicant is currently not in a counseling program. She has a ten year history \nof alcohol abuse and illegal drug abuse. Her last use of illegal drugs occurred in July \n2008, seven months after applying for a security clearance and while aware of her \nemployer\u2019s policies against illegal drug use. While the evidence reveals that she has \nremained sober for over a year, it is too soon to conclude Applicant will remain alcohol \nand drug free in the future based on her ten-year history of substance abuse. I find \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under the drug involvement and  \nalcohol consumption guidelines.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On September 18, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\n\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge found that Applicant is a senior technical writer for a defense contractor.  She\nholds an advanced degree from a well-known U.S. university.

However, he concluded that she had failed to\nmeet her burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  He noted a paucity of record evidence in\ncorroboration of her claims to have paid off certain debts.  He also noted an apparent inconsistency\nin Applicant\u2019s explanations for the circumstances underlying one of the debts in the SOR, which is\npertinent in an evaluation of her credibility.  \u201cThe sparse record evidence fails to convince me of\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.\u201d  Id. at 9.  \nApplicant contends that certain of the Judge\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial\nrecord evidence.  For example, she stated that she had only been divorced twice, her first marriage\nhaving ended with an annulment.  She also denied having stated that she had a financial counselor\nother than her two attorneys.  To the extent that the challenged findings are error, they are harmless,\nin that they are not likely to have affected the outcome of the decision.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App.\nBd.

She has been working for her \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since September 2006.3 She attended college \nfrom June 1987 to June 1991, and received a Master\u2019s degree from a prominent U.S. \nuniversity. Applicant is currently single. She has been married and divorced three times, \nthe first two times when she was in her twenties. She last married in 1989, and was \ndivorced in 1995. According to her e-QIP answers, she has no children. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history can be summarized as follows: she was unemployed \nduring five months in 1998. After that, she was self-employed and/or underemployed \nfrom September 1998 to November 2005. From November 2005 to May 2006, she \nworked for a government contractor. After that, she was mostly unemployed until she \nwas hired by her current employer in September 2006.  \n \nApplicant stated she was issued a Defense Department confidential security \nclearance, around April 1985, when she worked for a defense contractor. There is no \nevidence that she ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation.  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 5 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn her 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed she had three \njudgments against her that were outstanding. She also disclosed having financial \nproblems and that she was trying to resolve them. Applicant\u2019s background investigation \naddressed her financial problems and included the review of her February 2008 and \nOctober 2008 credit bureau reports (CBRs) and her answers to two 2008 DOHA \ninterrogatories. The SOR alleges eight delinquent and/or charged-off accounts and \njudgments, totaling approximately $36,500. The delinquent debts were established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and her two credit reports (Items 8 and 9).4 Most of the debts \nhave been delinquent for many years. Four of the SOR allegations concerned \noutstanding judgments against Applicant. Three of the judgments were filed in 2002 and \none in 2008.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged an unpaid 2008 judgment owing $22,740. The debt originated \nfrom Applicant\u2019s defaulted credit card account. She initially disputed the value of this \ndebt without success. In 2008, Applicant retained legal counsel to help her resolve her \njudgments. In 2008, her attorney made settlement offers on four of her judgments, three \nof which were alleged as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($690), 1.f ($1,011), and 1.g ($4,030). The \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was not included in the settlement offer.  \n \nIn her response to the FORM, she claimed her attorney settled the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and that she was making payments. In her SOR response she \nstated that her payments on this judgment were to start in May. Notwithstanding, she \nfailed to present any documentary evidence to show she settled or that she is making \npayments on this judgment. In light of her financial history, Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated \nstatements are not sufficient to show she settled this judgment or that she is making \npayments. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows, however, that she paid two other judgments, for \n$9,295 (Item 4) and $1,657 (Item 8 and 9), which were not alleged in her SOR. She \npaid the $9,295 judgment after the creditor started garnishing her pay in 2009. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a collection of $5,691. Applicant denied this debt. She averred \nthis debt was duplicated as a $9,295 judgment in her CBRs, and that she paid it when \nshe paid the judgment. Applicant\u2019s evidence fails to establish that the paid $9,295 \njudgment is the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for the following reasons. In her May \n2008 statement to a background investigator, Applicant admitted she had two separate \naccounts with the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b on which judgments were obtained \nagainst her (Item 6, p. 4). Furthermore, a review of the CBRs indicates these two \ndelinquent debts are two separate legal obligations to the same creditor. I find SOR \u00b6 \n1.b to be Applicant\u2019s outstanding delinquent debt. \n \nApplicant formally disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($690) and 1.e \n($1,530) (Items 8 and 9), as indicated in the CBRs.  \n \n \n4  An applicant\u2019s credit report showing the delinquent debts alleged in an SOR is sufficient to \nestablish the government\u2019s prima facie case. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2003). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a collection of $350 by a large retailer. In her answer to the \nSOR, Applicant denied this debt, stating that the debt was not legitimate and that it was \nremoved from her CBRs. However, in her May 2008 statement to a background \ninvestigator, Applicant admitted this was her retail revolving account that she had used \nit to buy her clothing, and that she stopped paying it in 2002 (Item 6). Applicant \npresented no evidence this debt has been paid or resolved. I find that this debt is still \noutstanding. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,011) and 1.g ($4,030) alleged two outstanding judgments that \nApplicant admitted. She hired an attorney to help her to settle or resolve these \naccounts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleged a collection of $500 on behalf of a bank. The debt is \nestablished by the February 2008 CBR (Item 9). Applicant claimed she did not have any \naccounts with that bank and denied the debt in her answer to the SOR. There is no \nevidence that she formally disputed the account. \n \nApplicant explained her financial problems were the result of a major financial \ndownturn she suffered during the Information Technology (IT) decline in 2000-2002. \nAfter 2002, she was unemployed or underemployed until 2006, when she was hired by \nher current employer. Before 2006, she had low paying jobs and she did not have \nsufficient income to pay her day-to-day living expenses and her delinquent obligations. \n \nApplicant currently has a steady job and promised that she would be able to \nresolve her delinquent debts, and stay financially responsible in the future. She retained \nan attorney in 2007, to help her resolve some of her debts. In 2008, she retained \nanother attorney to assist her with resolving her judgments. She claimed she has been \nworking with a financial counselor to pay her delinquent debts. It is not clear whether \nshe is talking about her attorneys or another financial counselor. Applicant\u2019s CBRs show \nthat she paid three delinquent and/or charged-off debts, formally disputed two other \ndelinquent debts, and paid two judgments. Other than these accounts, Applicant \npresented little evidence of other paid debts, settlement agreements, or efforts to \nresolve her delinquent debts since she acquired them.  \n \nApplicant admitted that she has not always used her best judgment addressing \nher debts and that she has failed to resolve her financial problems in a timely manner. \nShe said that she was having problems identifying her legal creditors because of the \nduplication of her debts during the lengthy collection process.  \n \nAccording to her October 2008, response to interrogatories, Applicant\u2019s gross \nmonthly salary was approximately $5,401, and her deductions were $1,957, for a net \nincome of $3,444. Her monthly expenses totaled $1,485, and she was paying only three \ndebts totaling $998. She had a net remainder of $961. Applicant has been borrowing \nmoney from her 401(k) retirement plan to meet the deficit caused by a garnishment of \npay imposed in 2009.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant is a patriotic citizen and never misses voting in a Presidential election. \nShe was appointed by a state family court as a volunteer guardian ad litem. She \nbelieves she acted in good-faith because she started paying her delinquent judgments \nas soon as she had the income to do so. She also claimed she paid many debts in a \ntimely manner. She failed to present documentary evidence to corroborate either of her \nclaims. She also believes she is living in an austere and prudent manner. She claimed \nher debts were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, but due to the \nfinancial downturn she suffered during the IT decline. Applicant averred she has \nmedical problems that prevented her from working more than one job. Her current \nemployer made reasonable accommodations that permit Applicant to work full-time. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated eight delinquent and/or charged-off accounts and \njudgments totaling approximately $36,500, most of which have been outstanding for \nmany years. Four of the SOR allegations concern judgments filed against Applicant \u2013 \nthree in 2002 and one in 2008. Applicant\u2019s evidence of efforts to resolve her financial \nobligations is summarized as follows: she retained attorneys in 2007 and 2008 to help \nher resolve her debts; in 2008, her attorney proposed settlement agreements in four of \nher delinquent judgments; she paid two judgments (not alleged in the SOR); she paid \nthree debts not alleged in the SOR; and she formally disputed two additional debts. She \npresented no other documentary evidence of efforts to pay or resolve any of the \nfinancial obligations alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \n6  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. Her financial problems are ongoing and her evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence to establish circumstances beyond her \ncontrol contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., periods of unemployment, \nbusiness downturn, and expenses caused by her medical condition. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence of efforts to resolve her financial obligations is summarized as follows: she \nretained attorneys in 2007 and 2008 to help her resolve her debts. In 2008, her attorney \nproposed settlement agreements on four of her delinquent judgments. She paid two \njudgments and three debts, all of which were not alleged in the SOR. Also, she formally \ndisputed two debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant presented no other corroborating \ndocumentary evidence of efforts to pay or resolve any of the financial obligations \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant has been consistently employed since September 2006. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nHer favorable information fails to fully establish a track record of financial responsibility. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there are no clear indications that her \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. She presented evidence that she \nreceived financial counseling through her attorneys and that she started making some \neffort to resolve her financial problems in 2007. However, considering the number of \ndelinquent debts, the date the debts were acquired (three are unpaid judgments dating \nback to 2002), the aggregate value of the debts, and the lack of corroborating \ndocumentary evidence of efforts to resolve her legal financial obligations prior to 2007, \nApplicant\u2019s information is insufficient to establish that her financial problems are unlikely \nto recur. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts in \nthis case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for her four \nyears working for government contractors. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation, or that she ever compromised classified information. Applicant is a patriotic \ncitizen and never misses voting in a Presidential election. She was appointed by a state \nfamily court as a volunteer guardian ad litem. These factors show some responsibility \nand mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. Applicant has not always used her best \njudgment addressing her debts. She has failed to show good-faith efforts to resolve her \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfinancial problems in a timely manner. The sparse record evidence fails to convince me \nof Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   1.f - 1.h: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On September 18, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

The Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were affected by her prior unemployment.  However, he concluded that she had failed to\nmeet her burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  He noted a paucity of record evidence in\ncorroboration of her claims to have paid off certain debts.  He also noted an apparent inconsistency\nin Applicant\u2019s explanations for the circumstances underlying one of the debts in the SOR, which is\npertinent in an evaluation of her credibility.  \u201cThe sparse record evidence fails to convince me of\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.\u201d  Id. at 9.  \nApplicant contends that certain of the Judge\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial\nrecord evidence.  For example, she stated that she had only been divorced twice, her first marriage\nhaving ended with an annulment.  She also denied having stated that she had a financial counselor\nother than her two attorneys.  To the extent that the challenged findings are error, they are harmless,\nin that they are not likely to have affected the outcome of the decision.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App.\nBd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192\n(App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002), for discussion of harmless error.  Applicant\u2019s brief has not identified any\nharmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025\nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \nThough acknowledging that the Board cannot consider new evidence, she states that she\nwould be able to produce such evidence if permitted.  The Directive does not permit the Board to\ngrant this requested relief.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or\nconsidered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009); ADP Case No. 08-03721 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.\n28, 2009).

Finding no error, we affirm. 2 The Judge found that Applicant is a senior technical writer for a defense contractor. She holds an advanced degree from a well-known U.S. university. She has been married three times, each ending in divorce. Applicant experienced periods of unemployment prior to her present job. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, arising from consumer purchases, credit cards, etc. Some of the debts had been reduced to judgements in favor of the creditors. Most of the debts had been delinquent for many years. Applicant experienced a financial downturn in 2000, due to the decline in the information technology industry. She has enlisted the services of two attorneys to assist her in resolving her financial problems. \u201cShe claimed she had been working with a financial counselor to pay her delinquent debts. It is not clear whether she is talking about her attorneys or another financial counselor.\u201d Decision at 4. The Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were affected by her prior unemployment. However, he concluded that she had failed to meet her burden of persuasion as to mitigation. He noted a paucity of record evidence in corroboration of her claims to have paid off certain debts. He also noted an apparent inconsistency in Applicant\u2019s explanations for the circumstances underlying one of the debts in the SOR, which is pertinent in an evaluation of her credibility. \u201cThe sparse record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Id. at 9. Applicant contends that certain of the Judge\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial record evidence. For example, she stated that she had only been divorced twice, her first marriage having ended with an annulment. She also denied having stated that she had a financial counselor other than her two attorneys.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n10, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 30, 2009, scheduling the \nJanuary 20, 2010\n\n2 \nhearing for November 3, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were received without objection. A \nstipulation to the admissibility of GE 1 through 6 was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, which \nwere received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open \nto submit additional information. Applicant submitted 14 pages of documents, which \nwere marked AE E through I and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nmemo is marked HE II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November \n12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer as a temporary employee since March 2008, and as a permanent \nemployee since August 2008. She has a General Educational Development (GED) high \nschool equivalency diploma, and she attended trade school. She is not married. She \nhas two children, ages six and five.1 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts. The debts are established by credit \nreports obtained on April 1, 2008 and March 16, 2009. Applicant admitted to owing the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.n, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t. She denied \nowing the remaining ten debts. The total amount owed on the ten debts that Applicant \nadmitted is about $20,651.2  \n \n \nApplicant stated her financial problems can be traced to when she was younger \nand financially unsophisticated. She lived with the father of her children for a period, but \nhe was frequently unemployed or incarcerated. He was recently released from prison. \nHe has not paid child support, and she does not anticipate that he will at any point in the \nforeseeable future. She also had periods of unemployment and low-paying jobs. She \nlived in transitional housing for a time because she could not afford to live on her own. \nShe currently shares an apartment with her mother. Applicant also admitted to some \nfinancial irresponsibility. She stated that she was an \u201cimpulse buyer and when [she] was \nupset [she] would shop.\u201d3   \n \n \nThe debts that Applicant admitted owing include rent on an apartment ($1,897), a \ncredit card ($2,394), a school ($410), the deficiency owed on a car loan after the car \nwas repossessed ($13,493), a public library ($366), two medical accounts ($310 and \n$658), a video store ($63), and two cellular telephone accounts ($457 and $603). \nApplicant borrowed books from a library and did not return them. She stated she gave \nthe books to a friend who was supposed to return the books to the library, but did not. \nApplicant paid $20 to the library on December 28, 2008, bringing the balance on that \ndebt to $345. She admitted the car loan, but stated that the amount should be less. She \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 28-30, 49; GE 1. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5. \n \n3 Tr. at 16-21, 29, 31; GE 3. \n \n\n3 \nstated that she received a letter from the creditor stating the car was sold for $3,000. \nShe was unsure if she still had a copy of the letter. She was requested to provide a \ncopy of the letter in her post-hearing submission. The letter was not submitted.4  \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $5,947 owed to a collection \ncompany on behalf of an apartment landlord, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. She admitted \nthat she was a tenant in the apartment, she did not pay all the rent owed, and she \nvacated the apartment about six months into a one-year lease. She stated the landlord \nobtained a judgment against her while she was still living there for about $1,300. She \nhas not paid the judgment. She did not submit any documentation to substantiate her \ndispute of the additional amount owed.5   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i through 1.m, \nand 1.o through 1.q. The total amount of the nine debts is $2,217. She stated that she \nhad insurance or her medical bills were paid by the state when the debts were allegedly \nincurred. The names of the health-care providers were not listed on the credit reports in \nevidence or alleged in the SOR.6  \n \n \nApplicant consulted with a financial counseling service in February 2007, and \nreceived a budget and action plan. She listed multiple delinquent debts and a judgment \non her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) submitted in March 2008. She fully \ndiscussed her finances and delinquent debts when she was interviewed for her \nbackground investigation in May 2008. She told the investigator that she was meeting \nher current obligations. She planned on saving money to pay her delinquent debts with \nlump-sum settlements. She responded to DOHA interrogatories in December 2008. She \nstated that she had a payment plan to pay $232 per month for three months to the \nschool identified in SOR \u00b6 1.d. She stated that she would pay the library $20 to $40 per \nmonth until paid. She indicated that her plan was to implement monthly payments to \nthree debts at a time until they were paid in full. She would then start paying another \nthree debts. Applicant has not made any payments on the debts listed in the SOR other \nthan the $20 paid to the library, as discussed above. She received an income tax refund \nlast year of about $5,800. She paid a debt of about $300 that was not listed on the \nSOR, and she purchased a computer for her children. As for the remaining money, she \nadmitted that she \u201cblew it.\u201d She lent some of it to friends who did not repay her.7    \n \n \nApplicant stated she is in much better shape financially now than she has been in \nthe past. She received counseling, which has helped her cope with her shopping issues. \nShe has a budget. She is not incurring overdraft fees. She is living within her means \nand not incurring new delinquent debt. She is in contact with an attorney and intends to \nfile bankruptcy.8 She stated in her post-hearing submission: \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 43-46, 59-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-3. \n \n5 Tr. at 35-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n6 Tr. at 40-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-7. \n \n7 Tr. at 22-27, 46; GE 1-3 \n \n8 Tr. at 20-27, 30-35; GE 3; AE B, F, H. \n\n4 \nI have completed a new budget and am sticking to it. When I receive my \ntax return, I am going to pay off [XXXX] Schools and [YYYY] Library for \nthe funds that I owe them. I am going to put the vast majority of the rest of \nit into either savings or a CD (I will be talking with a bank advisor on my \nbest options).9 \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters from her supervisor and co-workers. The supervisor \nattested to her excellent job performance, and that she is a \u201chardworking, honest \nindividual who consistently goes above and beyond for [their] beneficiaries.\u201d The co-\nworkers similarly endorsed her trustworthiness, character, and value to their company. \nHer performance appraisals reflected that Applicant is a superior employee who \nexceeded the standard for her position.10  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n9 AE F. \n10 AE A, C, D, G, I. \n\n5 \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:   \n   \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).  \n \n \n \n\n6 \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20(a) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. Her financial issues \nare recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and low-paying jobs. When she lived \nwith the father of her children, he was frequently unemployed or incarcerated. He does \nnot pay child support. Those are conditions that were largely beyond her control. To be \nfully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant admitted she was an \u201cimpulse buyer\u201d who bought clothes \nwhen she was upset. She borrowed books from a library and did not return them. She \nreceived a $5,800 income tax refund, paid a debt for about $300, bought a computer for \nher children, and \u201cblew\u201d the rest. She has not made any payments on the debts alleged \nin the SOR other than a $20 payment to the library in December 2008. She has not \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \n \n \nApplicant received counseling. She intends to pay the debts to the school and \nthe library with her income tax refund. She stated that she will put the vast majority of \nthe rest of it into either savings or a CD. She intends to resolve the remaining delinquent \ndebts through bankruptcy. Applicant clearly has matured. She has addressed her \nshopping issues. She has a budget; she is living within her means; and she is not \naccruing new delinquent debt. She is on the right track, but there is not sufficient \nevidence for a determination that her financial problems are being resolved or under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. Her actions do not qualify as a good-faith \n\n7 \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.11 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \napplicable. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $5,947 owed to an apartment landlord. She \nadmitted that she was a tenant in the apartment, she did not pay all the rent owed, she \nvacated the apartment before the end of the lease, and the landlord obtained a $1,300 \njudgment against her, which she has not paid. She did not submit any documentation to \nsubstantiate her dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing two medical debts totaling $968. She denied owing \nnine medical debts totaling $2,217. She stated that she had insurance or her medical \nbills were paid by the state when the debts were allegedly incurred. The names of the \nhealth-care providers were not listed on the credit reports in evidence or on the SOR. I \nfind that Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \nmedical debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i \nthrough 1.m, and 1.o through1.q.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n                                                          \n11 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n8 \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is 26 \nyears old. She had periods of unemployment and low-paying jobs, and the father of her \nchildren was frequently unemployed or incarcerated. He does not pay child support. \nShe also was irresponsible about her finances and was an \u201cimpulse buyer.\u201d In 2008, \nshe told the background investigator and DOHA that she would resolve her debts, but \nshe has done almost nothing about them, despite receiving a large income tax refund \nlast year. Applicant has clearly matured. She is now a valuable and trusted employee. \nHowever, there is not enough evidence in the record for me to conclude that her \nfinances are in good order.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.q: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.t: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Joseph Testan, Attorney At Law\nJuly 19, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated April 8, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On October 5, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as\namended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on November 2, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on January 22, 2010.  Due to a previously scheduled\nperiod of medical leave, a notice of hearing was not issued until April 12, 2010,\nscheduling the hearing for June 8, 2010.  The Government presented ten exhibits,\nreferred to Government Exhibits 1 to 10, which were admitted without objection.  The\n\n2\nApplicant called two witnesses and presented thirteen exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through M, which were admitted without objection.  The Applicant\nalso testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 22,\n2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 52 years old, and married with four\nchildren. He is employed by a defense contractor as a heating and air conditioning\nmechanic and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR.)  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nThe Applicant admits each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline, except 1(k).  He explained that the reason he denied the debt in 1(k) was\nbecause he thought that it had been paid.  He later learned that it had not.  Credit\nReports of the Applicant dated April 22, 2008, August 22, 2009, and January 12, 2010,\ncollectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government\nExhibits 5, 6 and 7.)  \nThe Applicant served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from\n1976 to 1980.  In 1992, the Applicant opened up his own heating and air conditioning\nbusiness.  After struggling for several years, business picked up and became lucrative.\nIn 2000, a fire at the business caused the Applicant to lose business files and\ncomputers that had to be replaced.  The business eventually recovered and again\nbecame lucrative.  In mid 2006, the business experienced a severe down turn which\ncaused financial difficulties.  \nAt some point, the Applicant learned that his accountant, who had been tasked\nwith doing the payroll, failed to pay the quarterly payroll taxes for the business.  The\nApplicant testified that although she was writing up the checks for the tax deposits and\nhaving the Applicant sign them, she did not submit them for payment.  (Tr. p. 60).  In\nlate 2007, the Applicant was contacted by the IRS demanding full payment of past\npayroll taxes.  (Tr. p. 61).  At that time, the Applicant owed about $40,000 in payroll\n\n3\ntaxes.  An agreement was reached with the understanding that payments of $10,000 a\nmonth would be made to catch up.  Applicant\u2019s business made one payment of\n$10,000.  (Tr. p. 61).  Contractors were failing to pay for services rendered by the\nApplicant\u2019s business and he was unable to fulfill his obligation to the IRS.  As a result\ntax liens were filed against the Applicant\u2019s business and other business debts were\nincurred.  The Applicant was unable to support his family and so he took on a second\njob working for a defense contractor in April 2008.  He also closed his place of business\nand moved it into his garage at home.  (Tr. p. 90).   \nSince then, the Applicant has been working diligently to resolve his delinquent\nindebtedness. Tax liens owed to the State in the amounts of $10,251.00 and $2,190.00\nare being paid.  An installment agreement between the Applicant and the state dated\nMay 2009, indicates that the Applicant was to resolve the debts with monthly payments\nof $500.00 beginning June 15, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  Since then he has made\nregular monthly payments without difficulty or interruption and plans to continue doing\nso until the debt is paid in full.  (Tr. p. 77).  The debt has been reduced from $11,173.00\nto $5,322.72.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and H).  \nFederal tax liens owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are in the amounts\nof $1,338.00, $9,169.00, $3,937.00, $908.00, $9,324.00, $20,279.00 and $3,029.00. In\nan effort to resolve this indebtedness, over two years ago, the Applicant filed an Offer in\nCompromise in 2007, or early 2008.  It was rejected because the IRS claimed the\nApplicant was late in making a payment.  The Applicant was subsequently audited.  It\nwas determined that there was a small discrepancy in the amount of money owed by\nthe Applicant.  He paid it, and it was determined that he was not negligent in any way.\n(Tr. p. 68 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).  \nIt was then recommended by the IRS collection officer that the Applicant submit a\nsecond Offer in Compromise.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  In January 2010, the Applicant\nsubmitted a second Offer in Compromise.  He testified that the collections officer was of\nthe opinion that the Applicant\u2019s offer of $15,000 was a generous one that he thought\nwould be accepted.  (Tr. p. 72).  With the offer, the Applicant submitted a 20 percent\npayment of $3,000 and $350.00 for filing the offer.  Both checks were cashed.  (Tr. p.\n72).  The Applicant is currently waiting to find out if the second Offer in Compromise is\naccepted.  If it is accepted, his payments are expected to be approximately $1,200 a\nmonth.  If it is not accepted, he plans to pay it off as soon as possible.            \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $5,567.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit I).  \nThe only debt not paid is a debt owed to a creditor in the amount  of $3,590.00. \nThe Applicant testified that he has made efforts to resolve the debt by discussing the\npossibility of monthly payments, but the creditor wanted payment in full.  (Tr. p. 79).\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit K is a letter written by the Applicant to the creditor concerning the\nmatter.  (Tr. pp. 79-80).  Recently, the Applicant has received a summons from the\nattorney representing the creditor in the case, suing him for approximately $4,050 that\n\n4\nincludes attorney fees.  The Applicant testified that it is his intention is to pay off the\ndebt before he is required to answer the complaint.  (Tr. p. 81).              \nThe Applicant has recently filed his federal income tax returns for 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M).  His proposed refund is $5,056.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).     \nThe Applicant\u2019s business income fluctuates with the seasons.  His projected\nmonthly net income from his heating and air conditioning business during the summer\nmonths, on the low side, after expenses, is approximately $2000.00 monthly.  His\nprojected net income during the winter after expenses is between $500.00 and\n$1,000.00 monthly.  His financial budget indicates that there is sufficient income\navailable to him to continue to resolve his indebtedness.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).    \nA close friend of the Applicant, and the Applicant\u2019s wife, both testified at the\nhearing.  His close friend is a general contractor, who met the Applicant at church\ntwenty years ago.  He testified that the Applicant has been an exceptional friend who is\nhonest, reliable, trustworthy and exercises good judgment.  (Tr. pp. 40-42).  The\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she has been married to the Applicant for twenty years.\nShe considers him to be extremely responsible and trustworthy.  She has been working\nwith him to get their debts resolved.  Both of them recommended the Applicant for a\nposition of trust.  (Tr. pp. 49-51).        \nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s current supervisor indicates  that\nthe Applicant\u2019s work ethic, performance, and output have met or exceeded standards\nset for Air Conditioning Mechanics by the company.  The Applicant has proven that he\nis reliable, dependable and fits in well with his co-workers.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nEach of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are business related, and have\neither been resolved or are in the process of being resolved.  Circumstances largely\nbeyond the Applicant\u2019s control, mainly his business down turn and accountant/payroll\ntax difficulties, contributed to his financial indebtedness.  Since learning of these\nproblems he has been prudent and exercised good judgment in an effort to resolve his\ndebts.  He has taken on a second job and moved his place of business into his garage.\nHe is either in the process of setting up payment plans with his creditors, has already\nset up payment plans that he is following, and/or he has paid off the debt in full.  In\nregard to his federal tax debt, the largest of his delinquencies, he is waiting to see\n\n7\nwhether his Offer in Compromise is accepted.  If it is, he is prepared to make regular\nmonthly payments toward the debt until it is paid in full, if not, he will resolve it as soon\nas possible.  With respect to the debt that has not been paid at all, (the creditor who has\nrecently started to sue him), the Applicant is prepared to immediately negociate a\nsettlement or otherwise resolve the debt.  He in current with all of his income tax returns\nfilings.  He is living within his means and currently demonstrates financial rehabilitation.\nHe has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility and has resolved his financial indebtedness.\nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance and, 20(d) the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  The\nApplicant has indeed made a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve his debts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations.)  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole-person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                         Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH and E, Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 2, 2009, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nNovember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nthe government\u2019s written case on July 31, 2009. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 7, 2009. As of October 8, 2009, she had not \nresponded. The case was assigned to me on October 9, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since May 2008. She is seeking a security clearance for the first \ntime. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in May 2008. She is single with \nno children.1  \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana about 100 times between 2001 and January 2008. \nShe used cocaine on two occasions between 2004 and 2006. She was arrested in \n2005, and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol/drugs, possession \nof marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and failure to provide proof of \ninsurance. The police found marijuana and a pipe in her glove box after she was \nstopped for swerving. She pled guilty to DUI and possession of marijuana, and the other \ncharges were dismissed. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail with credit for time \nserved, fined $600, and ordered to attend an alcohol/substance abuse education \ntreatment program. The program consisted of ten alcohol classes over the course of two \nmonths. She completed the program in July 2005.2 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) and \ncertified that her answers were true on May 13, 2008. Section 24b asked: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and stated that between \u201c08/2001 (Estimated)\u201d and \u201c06/2006 \n(Estimated)\u201d she used marijuana 50 times. She also listed that she used cocaine on two \noccasions between May 2004 and January 2006. She listed her 2005 arrest for DUI and \npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia under other questions. Applicant \nadmitted that she intentionally provided false information by minimizing the amount of \ntimes she used marijuana and by stating her last illegal drug use was in June 2006. She \nwas concerned about the impact that revealing her complete drug use would have on \nher new job.3 She stated in her response to the SOR: \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. \n \n2 Items 4-7. \n \n3 Items 4-6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nI made some bad decisions when I was younger, but I decided to \nstraighten up and go back to school to receive a degree and get a \u201creal\u201d \njob. [Employer] is what I found and I would hate for my poor decision \nmaking to ruin this job for me. There\u2019s no excuse for me lying about the \ndates and number of times I used marijuana.  \n \n \nApplicant revealed her full drug use when she was interviewed for her \nbackground investigation in June 2008. She has not used illegal drugs since January \n2008. She stated that she has learned from her mistakes and has \u201cno intention of using \ndrugs again because they are illegal and harmful to her body.\u201d4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \n                                                          \n4 Items 4, 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;5 and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cocaine and marijuana possession and use are sufficient to raise AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n \n                                                          \n5 Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction.  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant used cocaine on two occasions between 2004 and 2006. She used \nmarijuana about 100 times between 2001 and January 2008. She has not used any \nillegal drugs since January 2008. She graduated from college in May 2008, and \nobtained a \u201creal\u201d job that same month with her current employer. She has stated a firm \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future. There is no bright-line rule as to whether \nconduct is recent. Applicant has not used illegal drugs in about 22 months. However, \nher drug use was extensive, occurred over the course of several years, and she was \nuntruthful on her SF 86 about how many times she used marijuana and when she \nstopped using marijuana. Her drug use continues to cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable. Applicant has stated \nthat she does not intend to abuse drugs in the future. She does not receive full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b) for the same rationale discussed above. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified her SF 86 in May 2008, when she minimized the \namount of times she used marijuana and stated that she did not use illegal drugs after \nJune 2006. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable as a disqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant discussed her full drug use when she was interviewed for her \nbackground investigation in June 2008. That does not constitute a prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. While she \nreceives credit for discussing the information with the investigator, it is insufficient to \nestablish a mitigating condition. I find that no mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 29 years old. She lied about her drug use on her SF 86. She deserves \nsome credit for being truthful about her drug use in her background interview in June \n2008, and for abstaining from drug use after January 2008. She appears to be \nremorseful, but at this time, concerns remain about her truthfulness, judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On December 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 8, 2009. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 2, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nJune 4, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 6, 2009, and\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on April 3, 2009. The government offered eight\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted 12 exhibits (AE) A\nthrough L, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 10, 2009. I held the record open until\nApril 17, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant timely\nsubmitted five exhibits, AE M through AE Q, which are admitted without objection. The\nrecord closed on April 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.c of the SOR.

Her daughter and younger son live\nwith Applicant and her husband. Her older son is currently incarcerated in a state\ncorrections facility.3\nIn 1988, Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Prior to this,\nher husband operated a cleaning business. Financial problems caused by loss of\nbusiness created significant financial problems, which led to the bankruptcy filing.

Rather, she managed her finances and bills until\nrecently.4\nApplicant\u2019s husband started a hauling business after the close of his cleaning\nbusiness. In 1996, Applicant\u2019s mother died, leaving her and her two brothers two\nproperties, which included two houses. She and her husband resolved all financial\nproblems concerning these properties within 18 months of her mother\u2019s death.\nSubsequent to her mother\u2019s death, her brother, who lived in another state, moved home\nand started living in their mother\u2019s house. To help him with resettling, Applicant and the\nother brother offered to pay the expenses on their mother\u2019s home.  An aunt and uncle\nlive in the second, smaller house, which they have lived in for many years prior to her\nmother\u2019s death.5\nApplicant\u2019s aunt and uncle pay her $100 to $200 a month for their housing. For\n10 years, her brother has not paid any costs towards the upkeep of property in which he\nlives. Recently, Applicant told this brother he needed to take financial responsibility for\nhis housing. He recently paid her $600 and she has requested that he pay at least $300\na month to her. She plans to transfer the title and the mortgage on the house to this\nbrother in May as she wants her name removed from both documents. She is current on\nher recurring bills.6\nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband, at age 54, began dialysis treatment for renal\nfailure. He continued to work in his business, but less often. Doctors decided that her\nhusband was a candidate for a kidney transplant. While preparing her husband for his\nkidney transplant, doctors discovered her husband also had heart problems. In May\n2008, doctors performed triple by-pass surgery on her husband. He has recovered from\nthis surgery, but is not working.7\n In the fall of 2008, doctors resumed preparing her husband for his kidney\ntransplant. Testing revealed that her incarcerated son was a perfect match and this son\noffered to provide his father with a kidney. The state corrections office advised Applicant\nthat she must pay all the costs of transporting her son from prison to the hospital and\nback. The state estimated the cost at $7,800 and requested payment prior to the\nsurgery. Tests also revealed that her husband suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. In\nFebruary 2009, doctors performed a liver transplant using an organ from a cadaver and\nintended to the kidney transplant at the same time. The doctors decided against using\nher son\u2019s kidney and to use the cadaver kidney. Problems arose and the doctors\npostponed the kidney transplant. Applicant\u2019s husband continues on dialysis and will\n\nAE D (Letter, dated May 23, 2008); AE E (letter, dated Nov. 13, 2008); AE I (Dec. 22, 2008); Tr. 18,  20-21,\n8\n34.\nGE 2; AE M (pay sheet from part-time job); AE Q (pay sheet from contractor position); Tr. 29, 32, 58-59.\n9\nApplicant listed life insurance as a monthly expense on her personal financial statement, but her records\n10\nindicate this money is deducted from her pay check.

Currently, doctors are treating him for\nhepatitis. He applied for social security disability twice and social security denied his\napplication twice.8\nApplicant earns approximately $65,000 a year. In March 2009, she received a\none-time $7,500 bonus. After deductions, her net monthly pay averages approximately\n$2,300 a month. Applicant obtained a part-time job in the fall 2008. She usually works\nTuesday through Saturday, 4:15 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. for a total of 13.75 hours. Her hours\nfluctuate each week, which impacts her net pay. This employer recently increased her\nhourly rate of pay from $9.50 an hour to $9.75 an hour. Her net pay in February 2009\ntotaled $483 and for two weeks in March 2009 totaled $156. Her monthly income from\nher part-time job averages $375. Her son contributes $250 a month to household\nexpenses and buys groceries regularly. Her daughter generally pays the telephone bill\nof approximately $200 each month and Applicant receives an average of $150  a month\nfor rent from her aunt and uncle. Her total monthly income averages approximately\n$3,300.9\nSince her husband\u2019s illness and loss of income, Applicant has experienced\ndifficulties meeting her monthly expenses. Her monthly mortgage on her home,\nincluding escrow fees, totals $1,600. The mortgage, including escrow fees, on her\nmother\u2019s property amounts to $947 a month; the loan for her husband\u2019s truck is $318;\nand a personal loan for husband is $142. She pays $330 in utilities and $700 in other\nexpenses, excluding groceries.  Her monthly expenses total approximately $4,037.\n10\nEach month she incurs a deficit of approximately $700 without including the cost of\nfood.11\nBecause of her husband\u2019s illness, Applicant has incurred additional unanticipated\nexpenses. His medical treatment has been performed at a major hospital 135 miles\nfrom their home, which necessitates payment of hotel bills and other travel expenses. In\nNovember 2008, she borrowed money from her 401K retirement account to pay\nexpenses. She also missed her mortgage payment for several months. Because the\ncorrections department required her to pay the $7,800 before it would transport her son,\nshe used her mortgage money to pay the bill. During this time, she has worked with her\ncreditors, who have been cooperative. When the doctors decided not to use her\n\nAE G: AE H: AE J; Tr. 34-35, 54-55.\n12\nTr. 49-54, 65.\n13\nSOR; GE 5 (Credit report, dated Apr. 6, 2007); AE 6 (Credit report, dated May 30, 2008); GE 7 (Credit report,\n14\ndated Apr. 25, 2008); GE 8, supra note 10; Tr. 24.\nAE N (2007 tax form); AE O (2006 tax forms); AE P (2005 tax forms).\n15\n5\nincarcerated son\u2019s kidney, the state returned the money she paid. She used this money\nto pay her overdue mortgage payments.12\nApplicant acknowledged that she is behind in the taxes for the property where\nher aunt and uncle live and that she has tax issues related to her husband\u2019s business\nand business truck. She is working on these issues with staff at the tax office. She\nstates that she has always juggled her bill payments.13\nThe credit reports of record reflect a $45,000 and $22,000 debt with a bank, and\notherwise a generally good debt payment history. Department Counsel agreed at the\nhearing that these debts are the same. Thus, the SOR alleges nonpayment of the\n$45,000 debt. Applicant indicated this debt relates to her husband\u2019s truck, which has\nnow been sold and his business closed. Applicant paid this debt through a settlement\nwith the bank.14\nApplicant provided copies of her income tax returns for the tax years 2005, 2006\nand 2007. In 2007, she had a significant increase in income from capital gains after\nselling her husband\u2019s business property. His actual income for that year was $5,500.\nShe did not owe taxes in any of these years; rather she received a significant refund\neach year. Throughout the clearance process, Applicant has provided information about\nher financial problems.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n16\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE3.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd.

Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n16\n\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)(explaining standard\nof review).\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time after her husband became ill. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and (f) are not applicable in this case.\n17\n8\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose after her husband became ill. This mitigating condition is not\napplicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s husband\nstarted dialysis in 2006 and continues with it. Over the last three years, her husband\nhas undergone triple bypass surgery and a liver transplant. He is currently being treated\nfor hepatitis and undergoing dialysis, while he waits for a kidney transplant. His health\nproblems have increased incidental expenses related to his medical care and caused\nthe loss of his income as he is not working. The medical problems of Applicant\u2019s\nhusband are a circumstance beyond her control. Despite her significant financial\nproblems, Applicant pays her bills. Although she has not always been timely, she works\nwith her creditors when problems arise. She does not ignore her financial issues. I find\nthis mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Although Applicant has not received financial counseling, she\nhas resolved the only debt listed in the SOR through settlement. While she continues to\nhave some financial problems, she pays her bills and has not incurred excessive unpaid\ndebts. Her financial issues are under control. I conclude these  mitigating conditions\napply.17\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\nFuture promises are not relevant to a determination of an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. In this case, her\n18\ntrack record for managing her debt shows she will follow through on this decision.\n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nand her husband used the bankruptcy progress to discharge debts in 1987. More\nrecently, Applicant has experienced difficulties paying her regular bills and at times,\ndoes not have enough income to pay her monthly expenses.\nUnder the whole person concept, the mitigating evidence is more substantial. For\nnearly 20 years after Applicant and her husband filed bankruptcy, they paid their bills\nand managed their finances. Financial difficulties arose when her husband developed\nrenal failure in 2006 and needed to undergo dialysis on a regular basis. As his kidneys\nbegan to fail, doctors determined he would be a good candidate for a kidney transplant\nand that his incarcerated son was a match. In order for his son to come to the hospital\nto donate his kidney, the state required Applicant to pay $7,800 for the cost of\ntransporting and guarding her son while he was out of prison. In preparation for his\ntransplant, doctors discovered first a heart problem, necessitating triply by-pass surgery,\nand later cirrhosis of the liver, which lead to a liver transplant and a delay in the kidney\ntransplant. During this time, the financial contribution of Applicant\u2019s husband to\nhousehold expenses ended. Her younger son and daughter are now living at home and\ndo help with some monthly household expenses.\nApplicant and her brothers decided to keep their mother\u2019s properties after she\ndied in 1996. For more than 10 years, Applicant has paid the cost of these properties,\nwhile receiving no financial assistance from her brother who lives in the house and\nminimal financial assistance from her aunt and uncle who live in the second house on\nthe property. Applicant has finally demanded money from her brother and credibly\ntestified that she will transfer the title and mortgage to her mother\u2019s property to the\nbrother who lives in it.  With the loss of this expense, Applicant will have sufficient\n18\nmoney each month to cover her living expenses.\nDuring the last three years, Applicant has worked diligently to keep her bills paid\nand her expenses under control. She has not lived excessively. She contacted her\ncreditors about her financial problems and worked with them to resolve payment issues.\n\n10\nHer regular expenses are paid. Her debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or\nduress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are paidBit is whether\nher financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security\nclearance. While she still has financial issues, particularly with property taxes, these\nissues do not raise security concerns, as her track record indicates she will resolve her\nremaining tax issues. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She \nattended college from August 2000 to May 2002, from March 2004 to October 2006, \nand from August 2006 until the present. She expects to graduate in August 2011. (AX \nA.) The student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.cc-1.ff were incurred during her college \neducation. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant filed a second petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2002, solely in \nher name. She testified that this bankruptcy was largely the result of medical bills. She \nhad left the Navy, was separated from her husband, incurred substantial medical bills \nfor her children, and had no medical insurance. (Tr. 35.) She received a discharge in \nAugust 2002. (GX 5.) This bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 31 delinquent debts, of which nine were reduced to judgments. \nApplicant testified that she did not contact her creditors after she began working for a \nfederal contractor in January 2005, because she concentrated on repaying personal \nloans from her mother and other family members. (Tr. 67.)  \n \nThirteen of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f-1.h, 1.j-1.m, 1.s, \n1.t, and 1.z-1.bb) are for medical and hospital services. Some are for small amounts, \ne.g., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c for $100, 1.m for $54, and 1.aa for $32. In March 2008, she told a \nsecurity investigator that her ex-husband was obligated by their \u201cdivorce agreement\u201d to \npay the medical debts. (GX 2 at 4.) The record does not reflect whether this was an \ninformal agreement or a provision in the divorce decree.  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in October 2008, Applicant declared that \nshe was trying to settle the debts. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted all the \nmedical debts, of which six were reduced to judgments, and for each she stated she \nattempted without success to set up a payment arrangement when she first incurred the \ndebt, and that she was now trying to set up a payment plan for each debt. She recently \nretained a law firm to assist her in verifying debts and negotiating payment plans for her \nmedical debts as well as other debts. (Tr. 62-63.) She did not provide documentary \nevidence of any payment plans. At the hearing, she admitted she had not made any \npayments on any of the thirteen medical debts. (Tr. 70-75.)  \n \nIn her post-hearing submission, Applicant presented evidence that she had been \ngiven an opportunity to apply for a charitable write-off of the debts for hospital services \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k. (AX C.) There is no documentary evidence that she \napplied for or received a full or partial write-off. \n \n \nTwo delinquent debts are related to Applicant\u2019s purchase of a home in May or \nJune of 2006. She borrowed the money for closing costs, resulting in the judgment for \n$3,050, which is unsatisfied, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 70.) The home was \nforeclosed in January 2007, with about $79,896 due on the mortgage, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.gg. The property was purchased by the lender for $67,900. (AX I.)  \n \nApplicant testified that her mortgage was sold shortly after she purchased the \nhome, that she was not notified that the mortgage had been sold, and that she sent her \npayments by cashier\u2019s checks to the old lender. She also testified that after the \nforeclosure sale her cashier\u2019s checks were returned to her. I kept the record open to \nenable her to present copies of the checks or other financial records showing that the \nchecks were never cashed. On September 2, 2010, she informed me that the issuer of \nthe cashier\u2019s checks was sending her copies of the checks, but she did not submit \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncopies of the checks or any further evidence on this issue. The record does not reflect \nwhether the lender will seek a deficiency judgment. She has retained a law firm to \ninvestigate the circumstances of the foreclosure. (AX B; AX M.) \n \n \nApplicant referred the collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n to her law firm for \nverification, but the account is still unresolved. (AX L; Tr. 74.) She disputed the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.v., and both debts were removed from her \ncredit file. (AX G.) She also testified that she disputed the debt for telephone service \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r, but she provided no documentation of the dispute.  \n \n \nApplicant testified she resolved the three delinquent debts for cable service \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o-1.q. She did not provide receipts for the payments, but she \nsubmitted a document showing that her account was current. (AX D; Tr. 65.) She \nsubmitted documents showing that she resolved the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.u and 1.w. (AX F; AX H.)  \n \nApplicant admitted that the delinquent credit union loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is \nunresolved. (Tr. 71.) She testified she was making payments on the cell phone debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y, but she produced no documentary evidence of a payment \nagreement or payments made. She testified she was attempting to settle the delinquent \nlibrary fees alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x, but the debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 75.)  \n \n \nApplicant denied the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.cc-1.ff. She \ntestified that her student loans were deferred because she was still a student. Her \ntestimony is corroborated by her most recent credit report, which lists numerous \ndeferred student loans. (GX 10.) \n \n \nApplicant received credit counseling from her credit union about a year ago. She \ntestified that the credit counselor assisted her in making a budget. She promised to \nprovide a copy of her written budget after the hearing, but she did not. (Tr. 61-62.) \n \nThere is no evidence in the record reflecting Applicant\u2019s current income and \nexpenses. Although she responded to two sets of DOHA interrogatories (GX 2 and GX \n3), she was not asked to submit a personal financial statement. \n \n \nApplicant is very active in her community. She is serving her second term as \npresident of the parent-teacher association for the middle school in her community. As \npresident, she increased the membership from 67 to 292. She also serves on the \nadvisory board for an educational outreach program designed to prepare at-risk \nstudents in middle school and high school to prepare for life after high school. She has \nestablished a partnership between her employer and the outreach program, in which \nemployees visit schools participating in the outreach program and make motivational \nspeeches. (AX A; Tr. 40-44.) Her spouse corroborated her description of her extensive \ncommunity service, commenting that she \u201cdoes too much.\u201d (Tr. 79.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending \nand the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(e): consistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \nThere is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending\u201d after Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy discharge in 1995, but her admitted financial irresponsibility before that \nbankruptcy discharge raises AG \u00b6 19(b). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e) are raised by her \ncurrent financial situation. \n \n \nSince the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s two \nbankruptcy discharges are not recent, but they are a part of a chain of financial \nproblems that began during her Navy service and have continued to the present. Her \ndebts are numerous, ongoing, and not the product of circumstances making them \nunlikely to recur. I conclude that this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n \nApplicant has encountered several conditions beyond her control: her marital \nbreak-up in September 1997, the death of her child in October 1997, her periods of \nunemployment and underemployment between May 1997 and January 2005, uninsured \nmedical expenses, and a downturn in the housing market. Evidence that the foreclosure \nof her home occurred because of misrouted payments could apply under this mitigating \ncondition, but she has failed to provide any documentation of the circumstances of the \nforeclosure.  \n \nNevertheless, this mitigating condition is not established because the second \nprong (responsible conduct) is not established. She has been employed continuously \nsince January 2005, and she learned shortly after filing her security clearance \napplication that her delinquent debts raised security concerns. She did not seek \nfinancial counseling or legal help until recently. She admitted at the hearing that she had \nnot made any payments on the medical debts, even though several are for small \namounts. She has taken no action to resolve the delinquent credit union loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. She has presented no documentary evidence that the telephone bill in SOR \n\u00b6 1.r, the library delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.x, and the cell phone bill in SOR \u00b6 1.y are \nbeing resolved. She has not provided any information about her income and expenses, \neven though she promised at the hearing that she would submit her current budget \nbefore the record closed. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s financial situation is not \nunder control. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \n \nApplicant recently resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.u, and she paid the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w several years ago. The student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.cc-1.ff \nare deferred now that she has resumed her college education. However, Applicant does \nnot have a specific plan for resolving the remaining delinquent debts, nor has she taken \nsignificant actions to resolve them. Thus, I conclude that the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 \n29(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.w, and 1.cc-1.ff, but it is not \nestablished for the remaining delinquent debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). This \nmitigating condition is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.v, which \nwere disputed and deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit file. She testified she disputed the \ntelephone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r, but she produced no documentation substantiating \nthe basis for the dispute. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent, energetic, articulate, and well-educated woman. Her \nrecord of civic involvement is impressive. Her financial situation would likely be much \nimproved if she had devoted the same level of energy to her financial obligations as she \nhas to her civic duties.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.q: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.t: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u-1.w: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.x-1.bb:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.cc-1.ff:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.gg:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On April 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 5, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark Harvey\n\n2\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case was erroneous and whether the Judge\nattempted impermissibly to grant a contingent security clearance.  Consistent with the discussion\nbelow, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nDepartment Counsel correctly points out that this record does not support the Judge\u2019s\napplication of FCMC 20(b), given that Applicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment were a\nconsequence of his own decisions and, therefore, not \u201clargely beyond his control.\u201d  Still, in the\nJudge\u2019s unchallenged whole-person analysis, he reached favorable conclusions regarding (1)\nApplicant\u2019s financial counseling; (2) Applicant\u2019s payment of one of the four SOR debts and one\nlarge non-SOR debt; (3) Applicant\u2019s plan for paying his remaining debts; and (4) Applicant\u2019s (and\nhis spouse\u2019s)  full employment and ability to pay off their debts.  Under the circumstances of this\ncase, the decision is sustainable.\nDepartment Counsel argues that, in a footnote to the decision, the Judge attempted to grant\nApplicant a security clearance contingent on future monitoring of his financial condition.\nDepartment Counsel correctly states that DOHA has no authority to attach conditions to an\napplicant\u2019s security clearance, and the footnote in question explicitly acknowledges that prohibition.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).  Despite that, to the extent that a\nreasonable person might interpret the footnote as an effort to grant a contingent clearance, it can have\nno such effect as a matter of law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

He majored in business administration management (Tr. 7). He has been married for 36 years (Tr. 26). He has two children, ages 31 and 21 (Tr. 26). His daughter and granddaughter live in his home (Tr. 27). He does not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 8). Financial Considerations Applicant has four SOR debts, totaling about $44,971 as follows: (1) tax debt of $4,200 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) credit card/collection debt of $35,667 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); (3) department store/collection debt of $4,957 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and (4) electronics store debt of $147 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He worked for a large defense contractor from 1981 to 1997 in state F (Tr. 28). In 1997, his salary was $72,000 (Tr. 31).

He did not have a job in state U and chose to move there because he and his wife were originally from that state. He was unemployed or underemployed in sales at state U for about three years (Tr. 30-31).

He paid one debt, and one debt is in an established payment plan. Applicant \ncredibly promised to resolve the last two debts, and his track record of debt resolution \nprovides solid assurance that he will fulfill his promise. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 9, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 13), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nOctober 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 27, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 14). On May 21, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On May 26, 2009, the case was \nassigned to another administrative judge. On June 3, 2009, Applicant requested a \ncontinuance. On June 19, 2009, the administrative judge granted a continuance, and \nDOHA transferred the case to me (GE 9). On July 8, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing \nnotice setting the hearing for August 11, 2009 (GE 10). The hearing was held as \nscheduled. Department Counsel offered eight exhibits (Tr. 20; GE 1-8), and Applicant \noffered four exhibits (Tr. 22-25; AE A-D). Applicant did not object to my consideration of \nGE 1-8, and I admitted GE 1-8 into evidence (Tr. 20). Department Counsel did not \nobject to my consideration of AE A-D, and I admitted AE A-D into evidence (Tr. 25). \nAdditionally, I admitted the documentation concerning the continuance, Hearing \nNotices, SOR, and response to the SOR as administrative exhibits (GE 9-14). I held the \nrecord open after the hearing for Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. \nOn August 19, 2009, I received the transcript.  \n \nOn September 4, 2009, Department Counsel provided AE E-H to me. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to admission of AE E-H, and I admitted AE E-H into \nevidence. On September 5, 2009, I closed the record.    \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a government contractor (Tr. 6, 26; GE 1). \nIn 1986, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 7). He majored in business administration \nmanagement (Tr. 7). He has been married for 36 years (Tr. 26). He has two children, \nages 31 and 21 (Tr. 26). His daughter and granddaughter live in his home (Tr. 27). He \ndoes not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 8).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant has four SOR debts, totaling about $44,971 as follows: (1) tax debt of \n$4,200 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) credit card/collection debt of $35,667 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); (3) \ndepartment store/collection debt of $4,957 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and (4) electronics store debt of \n$147 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \nHe worked for a large defense contractor from 1981 to 1997 in state F (Tr. 28). In \n1997, his salary was $72,000 (Tr. 31). In 1997, he had about $300,000 in his 401(K) \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \naccount and he used that account to fund his move to state U (Tr. 29, 32). He did not \nhave a job in state U and chose to move there because he and his wife were originally \nfrom that state. He was unemployed or underemployed in sales at state U for about \nthree years (Tr. 30-31). Then he obtained state-government employment at state U and \nearned an annual income of about $15,000 (Tr. 31). In 1997, his wife obtained \nemployment cleaning houses and has subsequently had annual earnings of about \n$15,000 (Tr. 32, 34). From 1997 to 2006, he spent the money from his 401(K) on living \nexpenses (Tr. 32). In August 2006, he returned to employment with the defense \ncontractor in state F with a starting salary of $82,000 (Tr. 33). In January of 2007, he \ntransferred to state C (Tr. 34).  His spouse and family stayed in state U, and he \ncurrently lives in state C (Tr. 34). His current annual income is about $118,000 (Tr. 34). \nBeginning in August 2006, a significant expense has been maintenance of two \nhouseholds in two different states as well as travel between the two households.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($4,200)\u2014Paid. Applicant failed to pay his federal and state income \ntaxes in 2005 (Tr. 35-36). He had two reasons for not paying his taxes: (1) he had a \nproblem with the tax software he was using, and (2) he did not have the money to pay \nhis 2005 taxes (Tr. 50). He conceded his failure to pay his state and federal taxes in \n2005 was improper and wrong (Tr. 35-36). In 2006, he filed his federal and state income \ntaxes for 2005 and 2006 (Tr. 36, 50). He worked out a payment plan with the IRS; \nhowever, he accelerated the repayment and fully paid his remaining tax debt on April \n13, 2009, when he paid $1,146.55 (AE C). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($35,667)\u2014Unresolved.  Applicant held a credit card with a particular \ncompany for 35 years (Tr. 37). He used the credit card for living expenses and then \nstarting in October 2005 did not make his payments as agreed (Tr. 37-38). The balance \nowed in 2005 was about $18,000. He was unable to make payments because of low \nincome and exhaustion of his 401(K) account (Tr. 38). The credit card debt has \nincreased to about $40,000 (AE D at 5). Based on advice from his debt consolidation \ncompany (DCC), he did not contact the creditor for about two years (Tr. 39). On August \n1, 2009, the creditor offered to settle the debt for a lump sum payment of $26,281 (Tr. \n52). He did not have the funds saved to make this lump sum payment. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($4,857)\u2014Unresolved. This is a department store/collection debt.  \nHe purchased a variety of items (mostly household goods and tools) at a department \nstore and charged many of the items on a charge card (Tr. 40). He stopped making \npayments on this card in October 2005 (Tr. 41). He planned to save up enough money \nto settle the debt (Tr. 41). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($147)\u2014payment plan. This is an electronics store debt (Tr. 41). The \ndebt was actually about $2,000 not $147 as alleged in the SOR (Tr. 41). He has been \nmaking payments of about $100 monthly since 2007 (Tr. 42-43; Ex. D at 9, 10). This \ndebt is in current status. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report shows pays as agreed or pays satisfactorily on nine \nrevolving accounts, two installment accounts, and one other-category account (AE D at \n1). It also shows three delinquent other-category accounts (AE D at 1, 5, 7-8, 9). The \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthree delinquent accounts are for SOR \u00b6 1.b (AE D at 5); SOR \u00b6 1.c (AE D at 9); and \none non-SOR debt. The non-SOR delinquent account noted in the credit report is \nresolved as discussed in the next paragraph (AE D at 7-8).  \n  \nApplicant received financial counseling (AE E). The DCC advised him to save up \na lump sum and then offer to settle each debt (Tr. 39-40). He followed the DCC\u2019s \nadvice, and planned to follow that advice to pay all of his delinquent debts. For example, \nhe saved up a lump sum and paid a non-SOR credit card creditor $10,083 on June 3, \n2009 (Tr. 40, 47; AE B). \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax returns show the following adjusted gross income: 2008 \n($116,908); 2007 ($77,527); 2006 ($56,221); 2005 ($74,430); 2004 ($38,647); 2003 \n($57,500); 2002 ($57,069); 2001 ($48,083); 2000 ($48,218); 1999 ($13,615); and 1998 \n($48,175).  \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s monthly income, expenses, and remainder are as \nfollows: gross income ($11,083); net income ($5,600); rent for residences in two states \n($3,100); miscellaneous expenses ($5,400); and remainder ($200) (Tr. 43-46; AE F).  \n \nCharacter reference2 \n \nThe Director of Applicant\u2019s department at his employment has known him for \nmany years. He described Applicant as \u201chighly professional and very experienced.\u201d He \nis a \u201ctremendous asset.\u201d He attested that Applicant \u201cis an individual of the highest \nintegrity and demonstrates [un]impeachable ethics.\u201d He is confident Applicant is on the \nright track in clearing his remaining debts.   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n \n2The source for the facts in this section is a July 20, 2009, letter from the Director of a department \nof his employer. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are \nof security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response, his oral statement at his hearing, \nand the documentation he submitted. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as \nagreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n    \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).    \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant receives some mitigating credit because his delinquent debt \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [his] \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He established that he paid one \nsubstantial SOR debt and several non-SOR debts. He is making payments under a \npayment plan for one debt, and he is saving money so that he can settle the other two \nSOR debts. He promised to pay his last two SOR debts as soon as he has saved \nenough funds to settle them.3 He has a plan to keep his debts current. He has ample \nincome now to pay his debts, and resolve his last two SOR debts.   \n \nApplicant receives full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of unemployment and underemployment. He has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances by paying $11,000 to his creditors in 2009. He has \na logical and appropriate plan for resolving his last two SOR debts. He has made \nsufficient effort to pay off his delinquent SOR debts.4 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling from the debt \nconsolidation company, and there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control\u201d for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. He \nunderstands the security implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid \nfuture delinquent debt. He has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) because he showed substantial, recent good faith5 in the resolution of his SOR \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant did not contest the validity any debts. \n \n3 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance.  This footnote does not imply that this clearance is conditional. \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he established the full applicability \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c). Moreover, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \n\u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d infra at pages 8-9.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. Three SOR \ndebts and one large non-SOR debt became delinquent in 2005. He did not file his 2005 \nfederal and state tax returns until after he filed his 2006 federal and state tax returns. He \nfailed to maintain contact with all of his creditors. He should have ensured better \ndocumentation of his remedial efforts. These factors show some financial irresponsibility \nand lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns \nto merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. Applicant is a law-abiding citizen. He \nreceived financial counseling. The DCC advised him to save up a lump sum and then \noffer to settle the debt. He followed the DCC\u2019s advice. He paid one of four SOR debts. \nHe is making payments on one SOR debt totaling about $2,000. In 2008, his income \nincreased $40,000 to $116,908. In 2009, he applied about $11,000 and resolved two \nlarge delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s credit report shows pays as agreed or pays \nsatisfactorily on nine revolving accounts, two installment accounts, and one other-\ncategory account. He and his spouse now have had sufficient income to pay their debts \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsince they both became fully employed. The Appeal Board has addressed a key \nelement in the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He has achieved some important educational and \nemployment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. His \nfinancial problems were caused by his unemployment and underemployment, rather \nthan by his misconduct or irresponsible spending. Before his employment problems, he \ndid not have any delinquent debts. Applicant is an intelligent person and he understands \nhow to budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. Clearly, \nhe could have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts, after receiving employment \nwith a government contractor. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. \nMoreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-payment. He has \npromised to pay his valid debts. I found his statement to be candid, forthright and \ncredible.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through \nhis service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. A character witness described \nApplicant as highly professional, with strong integrity and solid ethics. He is a \ntremendous asset to his corporation. His many years of service supporting the \nDepartment of Defense are particularly important. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate \nthe financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \n \n \n \n1\nJune 30, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on January 9, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn January 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated April 13, 2009. The FORM contained \nseven attachments. On April 17, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along \nwith notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.

Her monthly net disposable income (gross \nincome less expenses) was approximately $750.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a May 2008 letter indicating she had contacted a financial \ncounseling organization. There is no evidence she entered into a formal agreement or \nindividualized program with that financial counseling organization to address her \nfinancial difficulties.  \n \n \nApplicant co-signed on a truck with her children\u2019s father. The high credit was \n$18,170 and monthly payments were $479. The truck was repossessed, resold, and a \nbalance of $9,827.55 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) remains on this debt. Applicant asserts, but failed to \nprovide any supporting documentation, the truck debt was in a bankruptcy3 proceeding. \nIn April 2008, the creditor offered to settle this matter for $3,439 if payment was \nreceived before March 28, 2008. Payment was not made. (Item 3)  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 Responses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. \n \n3 As of February 2008, when Applicant completed her SF-86, she had not filed for bankruptcy protection \nduring the previous seven years.  \n \n \n \n2\n\n \nApplicant purchased a vehicle for $18,868, which was repossessed resulting in a \ndebt of $13,257 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). The debt continues to accumulate interest. Applicant states \nshe tried to arrange payments on this debt. Applicant co-signed on a car for her son. \nThe original debt was $17,839 with monthly payments of $396. At one time her son was \nbehind on his payments and the debt was placed for collection, however, her son has \nbrought his payments current. The most recent credit reports (Items 6 and 7) indicated \nthe debt is being paid as agreed.  \n \n \nApplicant asserts, but failed to provide documentation, she is making $50 \nmonthly payments on a $180 debt listed in SOR \u00b61.a. Her credit report (Item 5) lists the \ndebt as having been placed for collection. Applicant asserts, but failed to provide \ndocumentation, the $85 debt listed in SOR \u00b61.b. has been paid in full. Her credit report \nlists the debt as having been charged off.  \n \n \nApplicant asserts, but failed to provide documentation, she would arrange to \nmake payments on the $330 medical debt listed in SOR \u00b61.c. Her credit report lists the \ndebt as having been placed for collection. She asserts, but failed to provide \ndocumentation, her son would arrange payments on the $435 debt listed in SOR \u00b61.d. \nThe SOR lists five accounts (SOR \u00b61.e through \u00b61.i) with a collection agency. Applicant \nprovided letters stating four debts with the agency have been settle in full. (Answer to \nSOR) \n \n \nApplicant stated she had contacted the telephone service listed in SOR \u00b61.k \n($182) and asserts the creditor could not locate the debt. She stated she would continue \nto pursue this debt. No further documentation was received. Applicant disputed the \n$193 debt listed in SOR \u00b61.n. Applicant\u2019s credit report indicated the account was closed \nand refinanced. Applicant stated the creditor of the $1,847 debt listed in SOR \u00b61.o \nwould not accept her offer of $50 monthly payments.  \n \n \nApplicant owed $1,970 on the debt listed in SOR \u00b61.p. In August 2008, the \ncreditor offered to settle this matter for $1,182.12 if paid by August 29, 2008. Payment \nwas not made. (Item 3) Applicant asserts, but failed to provide any documentation \nsupporting her assertion, she pay $50 bi-weekly on this debt. Applicant denied the $575 \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b61.q, which has been deleted from her credit report.  \n \nApplicant asserts, but failed to provide documentation, she would arrange to \nmake payments on the $495 gas utility debt listed in SOR \u00b61.r. Her credit report lists the \ndebt as not satisfied. Applicant asserts, but failed to provide documentation, the $303 \ninsurance debt listed in SOR \u00b61.s and the $164 insurance debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.t have \nbeen paid in full. Her credit report lists these debts as having been placed for collection. \nApplicant asserts, but failed to provide documentation, she would arrange to make \npayments on the $110 debt listed in SOR \u00b61.u. Her credit report lists the debt as having \nbeen placed for collection.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n \n \n \n3\n\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \n \n \n \n4\n\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. The SOR asserted 21 debts totaling in excess of $44,000, which were placed \nfor collection. Disqualifying Conditions Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n \n \n \n5\n\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant provided letters stating four of the five debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, \nand 1.i), with one creditor had been settled in full. Applicant\u2019s credit reports indicate the \nmonthly payments on the $14,017 car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.m) are being paid in a timely \nmanner. Applicant disputed two debts (SOR \u00b6 1.n and SOR \u00b6 1.q) which have been \nremoved from her credit report. Applicant contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($182) \nand was informed the debt could not be located.  \n \nThere is no evidence of payment on the remaining 12 debts, which total \napproximately $29,000. Applicant asserted, but failed to provide documentation, that \nthree debts were paid in full (SOR \u00b6 1.b, $85, SOR \u00b6 1.s, $303, and SOR \u00b6 1.t, $164). \nApplicant asserted, but failed to provide documentation, that an additional six debts \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a, $180, SOR \u00b6 1.c, $330, SOR \u00b6 1.d, $435, SOR \u00b6 1.p, $2,040, SOR \u00b6 1.r, \n$495, and SOR \u00b6 1.u, $110), totaling approximately $3,500, are being paid or she will \narrange payments. There has been no payment on three of the largest debts (SOR \u00b6 \n1.j, $13,257, SOR \u00b6 1.l, $9,827, and SOR \u00b6 1.o, $1,847), which total approximately \n$25,000.  \n \nApplicant asserts two of the debts resulting from repossession are or may be \nincluded in bankruptcy proceedings. Applicant has provided no documentation that she \nhas ever sought bankruptcy protection. The fact the co-signer may have included the \ndebts in bankruptcy would not relieve her obligation on these debts.  \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply to the remaining unpaid debts. The behavior \ndid not happen long ago. The behavior is not infrequent. There are numerous unpaid \ndebts. There is no evidence the obligations were incurred under unusual circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s stated intentions to pay off her \ndelinquent debts fall short of demonstrating a track record of financial reform and \nrehabilitation sufficient to permit the conclusion that Applicant\u2019s history of financial \ndifficulties will be resolved soon and will not recur.  \n \n \nThere is not sufficient record evidence to support application of Adjudicative \nGuideline \u00b6 20(b) that her financial problems were beyond her control, and she has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant did co-sign on two cars, one was \nrepossessed and payments are current on the other. Co-signing is not an event beyond \none\u2019s control.  \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has attended financial classes, maintains a \nbudget, is living within her means, or paying her debts in a timely manner. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. Applicant submitted a May 2008 letter indicating she had contacted a \nfinancial counseling organization. There is no evidence of a formal agreement or \nindividualized program with that financial counseling organization to address her \nfinancial difficulties. There is no showing payments have been made on any debt.  \n \n \n \n \n6\n\nApplicant has paid five debts and her son is current on his car payments. AG & \n20(d), that she has initiated a good-faith effort to repay her creditors, does apply to \nthese six debts. Applicant asserts she paid three additional debts and is paying or will \nstart paying six additional debts. However, she provided no documentation supporting \nher assertion. Without documentation showing her efforts are being implemented in an \norganized or structured way, it is premature to conclude Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \nhave been resolved or are under control. \n \nThe lack of documentation also prevents the applying AG \u00b6 20(d) to the \nremaining debts. A mere intention to repay debts without documentation establishing \nrepayment or a good-faith effort to repay her debts is insufficient to warrant applying this \nmitigating condition.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a single mother raising \nthree children. Her monthly disposable income (gross income less expenses) is \napproximately $750. In August 2008, when she answered the interrogatories, Applicant \nwas made aware of the government\u2019s concerns about her unpaid obligations. Ten \nmonths later, there is evidence Applicant has addressed five debts totaling less than \n$500 and her son is current on this car payments.  \n \nApplicant still has unresolved delinquent debts, which remain unpaid. She has no \nspecific, concrete plan for addressing or resolving her delinquent debts in the \nforeseeable future. As previously stated, her assertion she is trying to address her \ndelinquent debts lacks adequate corroborating documentation.  \n \n \n \n \n7\n\n \n \n \n8\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. However, a clearance at \nthis time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e -1.i: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m and 1.n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o and 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r -1.u: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On July 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nMay 28, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 15, 2009, and waived her \nright to a hearing before an administrative judge. However, on October 15, 2010, she \nwithdrew her waiver and requested a hearing. (Tr. 8.) On November 2, 2009, DOHA \nassigned the case to me. On February 25, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nsetting the case for March 30, 2010. The case was heard as scheduled.  Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and called one witness. She offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E into evidence without objection. The record remained open until April 16, \n2010, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted 17 pages of documents that I marked as AE F, H, and I, and admitted into \nevidence without objection.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 12, \n2010.                                                         \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the 38 allegations contained in \nSOR \u00b6 1, and provided information in support of her answer. Those admissions are \nincorporated in the following findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 29-years-old and married. She and her husband have two children, \nages three and nine months. She has an eleven-year-old from a former relationship. All \nthree children reside with them. She seldom receives child support for her oldest child. \nAfter graduating from high school, she attended college for a year and a half.  \n \n \nFrom 1998 until 2000, Applicant worked for an insurance company. She then \nworked for a bank for two years. In 2002, she bought a house. Subsequently, she quit \nher bank position to find a job closer to the new home, but remained unemployed for six \nmonths. During those six months, she and her husband were unable to consistently pay \nthe mortgage. By early 2003, their debts started to become delinquent and they moved \nto another state where her husband obtained a position that they anticipated would be \nmore lucrative. They remained there for a couple months and then returned to their \nhome state. She began working at temporary agencies and her husband resumed \nworking in his own construction business. They made periodic payments on their \nmortgage, but it went into foreclosure in 2004. From January 2006 until March 2008, \nshe \nworked \nfor \nvarious \nemployers \nwith \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment. Since March 2008, Applicant has worked as a medical claims \nprocesser for a federal contractor. Her husband works for a manufacturing company.   \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated May 2008, January 2009, and June \n2009, the SOR, filed on July 10, 2009, alleged that Applicant accumulated 38 delinquent \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ndebts totaling $116,770, including a delinquent mortgage of $92,203. The remaining \ndebts totaled about $25,000 and consisted of monies owed to credit card companies, \nutility companies, department stores, an insurance company, loan companies, a bank, \nand for an automobile repossession. Fourteen debts are owed for Applicant\u2019s medical \ntreatment and total around $2,600. On July 14, 2009, Applicant filed a Voluntary Petition \nfor Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. On October 22, 2009, the court entered an order, which \ndischarged all of the SOR-listed debts and other debt.1 (GE 6 at 24-38.) \n \n \nIn the fall of 2009, Applicant and her husband met with a financial counselor. (Tr. \n55.) With his assistance, they established a working budget and financial plan. They \nmet with him four times. (Tr. 56.) The counselor submitted a letter dated March 18, \n2010. He stated, \u201cThey are both motivated to achieve financial wellness once again and \nI look forward to working along side with them to achieve their goals.\u201d (AE E.) They also \ncompleted three hours of mandatory debtor education courses required by the \nbankruptcy court. (Tr. 57; GE 7.)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted her household budget. She and her husband have a monthly \nnet income of $4,072 and expenses of $3,631, leaving about $440 remaining. (AE H.) \nThey are saving money and hoping to purchase another home in the future. They are \nnot accumulating new debt. Their combined income for 2009 was $79,000 and for 2008 \nit was $60,000. They are financially more solvent now than in the early and mid-2000s. \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified. He primarily manages the household finances and \nbudget. (Tr. 78.) He reiterated that they were financially solvent until Applicant left her \njob sometime in 2002 and became unemployed for several months. He subsequently \nexperienced financial problems in his business, further exacerbating the situation and \naffecting their ability to pay the mortgage. At one point, he and Applicant were both \nunemployed. (Tr. 72.) Since working with the financial counselor and establishing a \nbudget, they no longer live paycheck to paycheck and have more money available than \nanticipated. (Tr. 76.) He is making monthly payments on a federal tax liability he owed \nfor unpaid employer\u2019s withholding taxes for years 2002 to 2006. The original liability was \n$8,500. (GE 6 at 21.) As of March 2010, the balance owed is $796. (Tr. 80; AE I.) He \nadmitted that they made some poor financial decisions during those earlier years. (Tr. \n76.) He is very informed about the status of their financial situation and monitors the \nbudget closely.    \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly and remorsefully. She has matured and learned the \nimportance of financial responsibility as a result of this proceeding and the 2009 \nbankruptcy. (Tr. 59.) She expressed gratitude for her position and the financial security \nit provides her. (Tr. 60.) Applicant submitted a copy of her 2009 performance \nevaluations that documented a \u201cMeets Expectation\u201d rating. (AE F.)  \n \n                                            \n1According to the Summary of Schedules, contained in the Voluntary Petition, Applicant and her \nhusband sought to release $151,500 of unsecured debt. In addition to the debts listed in the SOR, \nanother $22,000 was for medical services related to Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s care. (GE 6.)   \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . \n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant admitted owing the 38 SOR-listed delinquent debts totaling $116,770, \nwhich were discharged in 2009 through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The record shows a \nsix-year history during which Applicant was frequently unable to satisfy her debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a \nhistory of unpaid debt. Since Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any SOR-listed \ndebt, the four potentially pertinent conditions are: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies arose in 2003 and continued until very recently. \nHowever, she has now secured steady employment, and all prior debt was discharged \nin the 2009 Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. Her current family income is more than \nsufficient to cover living expenses, so recurrence of financial problems is unlikely. The \nfinancial problems arose largely due to periods of unemployment and underemployment \nfor her and her husband, which causes do not reflect on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. Accordingly, she established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(a).   \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application due to the unforeseen circumstances \nmentioned above. However, this mitigating condition has limited application because \nApplicant did not present sufficient documentation to demonstrate that she attempted to \nmanage the debts while they were accumulating and prior to filing bankruptcy.  \n \nApplicant is participating in ongoing financial counseling. She also completed \ndebtor education in connection with the bankruptcy, which resolved her previously \noutstanding debts in a good-faith manner. Her demonstrated solvency going forward, \ntogether with the bankruptcy relief from prior debt and adherence to a solid budget, \nindicate that her financial situation is under control. Remaining security concerns are \ntherefore mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 29-year-old \nwoman, who is successfully working for a federal contractor. Applicant\u2019s conduct of \nconcern involves delinquent debts incurred over six years during periods of involuntary \nunemployment and underemployment for her and her husband. She demonstrated \nmaturity and responsibility by acknowledging these debts, taking proper legal action to \nresolve them through bankruptcy, and initiating a responsible budget to prevent similar \nproblems from recurring. Those previous debts no longer pose a potential risk for \nduress or coercion. She now has steady employment and sufficient income to meet her \nliving expenses without incurring further delinquencies. She and her husband continue \nto work with a financial counselor to achieve financial security. Her husband closely \nmonitors their finances and budget, in order to prevent similar problems from recurring. \nBoth Applicant and her husband were impressive witnesses, acknowledging their \nprevious lack of financial maturity and current commitment to a solvent future. \n \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability \nand trustworthiness concerns arising from financial considerations, including her failure \nto pay her financial obligations over the past six years. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.ll:  \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to ADPI/II/III sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n                                  \n \n          \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on December 23, 2007. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on\nFebruary 3, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nAugust 18, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\nItem 4 (e-QIP).\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 17, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 19, 2009, and requested a decision on the written\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on April 29, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on May 4,\n2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response. DOHA assigned\nthis case to me on August 6, 2009. The government submitted nine exhibits, which have\nbeen marked as Item 1-9 and admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR\nhas been marked and admitted as Item 3.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nto 1.d and 1.f to 1.l of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\n1.e of the SOR.1\nApplicant, who is 29 years old, works as a document production supervisor for a\nDepartment of State contractor. He began this position in November 2007.2\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1998 and from a community college in\n2001 with an Associate of Fine Arts degree in graphic design. Applicant worked in retail\nstores from 1999 until 2007. Applicant married two years ago. He has a daughter, age\n5, and a son, age 5.3\nThe SOR alleges multiple unpaid debts, totaling $20,669. Appellant denies owing\nthe $614 debt in allegation 1.e and asserts a balance of $100 for the $223 debt in\nallegation 1.h. He has not provided documentation which shows his payments on these\ndebts. He has not provided any documentation to show that he has made payments on\nany of the other debts listed in the SOR or to indicate he has developed a payment\nplan. He has not explained how his debt problems occurred.\nApplicant stated that when he met with the security investigator in May 2008, he\nproposed paying $200 a month towards his unpaid debts, one creditor at a time. He\nsubmitted no evidence which shows that he has actually made any payments as he\n\nItem 9.\n4\nItem 10.\n5\nItem 5; Item 6; Item 7.\n6\n3\nproposed. Applicant did not prepare a budget, which would show his monthly expenses,\nnor did he provide a copy of his monthly earnings statement. The record lacks evidence\nwhich shows Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his old debts.4\nApplicant responded to interrogatories about specific debts on September 25,\n2008. In his answers, he indicated he had significantly reduced the balance in one\naccount and did not owe any back child support. Neither of these debts are listed in the\nSOR. He also indicated he anticipated paying the debt in allegation 1.e in full by\nNovember 2008. He further stated that he would pay the smaller debts, one at a time.\nAs previously mentioned, he did not provide any evidence that he continued with his\nplan to pay his debts or that he paid this debt.  \n5\nAll three credit reports in the record contain information which indicate a possible\nproblem with his credit information. The credit reports dated October 1, 2008 and\nJanuary 9, 2009 contain the notation \u201cfraud victim\u201d. The credit report dated January 9,\n2008 is marked \u201csecurity alert\u201d and makes reference to address problems. Applicant did\nnot discuss a problem with fraud and his debts. He has not explained this issue.\nApplicant did not provide any favorable evidence to support his request for a security\nclearance.6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The evidence of record reflects that Applicant accumulated\nsignificant delinquent debt over a period of time. He has not paid most these obligations\nand has not shown an ability or willingness to pay these debts. The evidence is\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20 (f) are not applicable in this case.\n7\n5\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ This potentially\nmitigating condition is not applicable because the record contains no evidence as to\nhow these debts occurred. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence that Athe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating\nunder AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d The record contains no evidence which would raise the application of these\nmitigating conditions. Applicant has not established any facts which show he has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.  \n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\n\n6\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\ncompleted an associates degree in 2001. He has always worked and supported his\nfamily. He has not provided any explanation as to how he incurred the debts listed in the\nSOR. He has not submitted evidence which showed his debts are resolved or are being\npaid. Likewise, he has not shown that his finances are under control. The record lacked\nany evidence which would indicate Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted she owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, and 1.e.2 She explained that the debts resulted from her divorce and not having sufficient income to address her debts. A mortgage lender advised her not to attempt to resolve her delinquent SOR debts because they would be removed from her credit report because they were stale. She did not recognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. She made payments towards the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e; however, when she changed jobs she asked the creditor to accept a lower payment and the creditor refused. She disputed her responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f because the creditor misrepresented the services that would be provided as part of the agreement. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old, and a defense contractor that has employed her since July 2007 in the areas of payroll, accounting, and human resources (Tr. 8, 24, 25).

Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 10, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 8) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nNovember 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 15, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On August 3, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel announced she was ready to proceed on her case. On August 10, \n2009, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On September 14 and 15, 2009, DOHA \nissued hearing notices (GE 6, 7). On October 14, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. At \nthe hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), \nand Applicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 20-21; AE A-D). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 19), and AE A-D (Tr. 22). Additionally, I admitted the Notices of \nHearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 6-9). On October 22, 2009, I received the \ntranscript.    \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted she owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.c, and 1.e.2 She explained that the debts resulted from her divorce and not having \nsufficient income to address her debts. A mortgage lender advised her not to attempt to \nresolve her delinquent SOR debts because they would be removed from her credit \nreport because they were stale. She did not recognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. She made \npayments towards the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e; however, when she changed jobs she asked \nthe creditor to accept a lower payment and the creditor refused. She disputed her \nresponsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f because the creditor misrepresented the services \nthat would be provided as part of the agreement. Her admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, and a defense contractor that has employed her since \nJuly 2007 in the areas of payroll, accounting, and human resources (Tr. 8, 24, 25). She \nhas full-time employment with the government contractor, and she has had a part-time \njob working as a bartender for two months (Tr. 27, 57, 71). She has a graduate \nequivalency diploma (GED) and about two years of college (Tr. 8). In college, she \nfocused on nursing, computers, and administration (Tr. 26, 27). After submitting her SF-\n86 in 2008, she received an interim Secret security clearance (Tr. 9, 25, 27).   \n \nApplicant married in 1995 and divorced in 2001 (Tr. 25, 26, 28; GE 1). She has \ncustody of her children who are ages 17 and 13 (Tr. 26). She has never served in the \nmilitary (Tr. 27). \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n2 The source for the facts in this paragraph is Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated June 15, \n2009 (GE 9). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nThe SOR listed six delinquent debts, totaling $17,760 as follows: 1.a (credit card \ndebt resulting in a judgment\u2014$7,595); 1.b (credit card\u2014$6,123); 1.c (credit card\u2014\n$1,722); 1.d (cell phone account\u2014$566); 1.e (cell phone account\u2014$1,173); and 1.f (cell \nphone account\u2014$581). \n \nAfter Applicant was separated from her spouse, she used credit cards to re-\nestablish her household (Tr. 29). Her husband promised to help with the credit cards, \nand they considered reconciliation of their marriage (Tr. 29). However, they were unable \nto salvage their marriage (Tr. 29). After her divorce she was unable to make her \nmonthly credit card payments (Tr. 29).  \n  \nA 2008 credit report shows the account relating to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a resulted \nfrom a credit card account opened in 2004 (Tr. 28, 32, GE 5 at 4). The account had a \nhigh credit amount of $3,602, and a balance of $6,235 (Tr. 32; GE 5 at 4). The creditor \nobtained a judgment for $7,595 in June 2005 (Tr. 35; GE 3 at 2). Applicant has not \ncontacted the creditor for at least a year or two (Tr. 32). In June of 2008, she applied for \na mortgage to purchase a home (Tr. 32). The lender advised her not to contact the \ncreditors and not to offer to settle her debts because it was too late (Tr. 32). Her old \ndebts would \u201cfall off\u201d of her credit report anyway because they were stale (Tr. 32).  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s 2008 credit report showed she opened the credit card account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b in November 2001 (Tr. 37; GE 5 at 5). Her credit report has a balance of \n$5,831 (GE 5 at 5). \n  \nApplicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,722) resulted from a credit card delinquency \n(Tr. 38). The date of last activity on account was August 2002 (Tr. 38; GE 5 at 11). \n  \nApplicant did not recognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($566) (Tr. 38). However, she \npreviously told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that this debt \nwas for a credit card she opened in 2000 (Tr. 39; GE 2 at 3). She believed the \ninformation in the OPM summary was erroneous because she did not believe she \nopened any credit cards with less than a $1,000 credit limit (Tr. 40). Even after receiving \nher 2008 credit report, she did not make any inquiries to determine her responsibility for \nthis debt (Tr. 40). \n  \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($1,173) and 1.f ($581) related to cell phone accounts \n(Tr. 40-42). She had some contacts with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e after the debt \nbecame delinquent; however, the creditor was unwilling to accept a low enough \npayment (Tr. 41). For the account in SOR \u00b6 1.f, the cell phone company told her that \nher cell phone would have coverage when she moved to a different state; however, her \ncell phone account charged very expensive roaming fees (Tr. 42, 43). She thought the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was possibly paid in 2005 (Tr. 43; GE 1). However, her 2008 SF-86, \nindicates, \u201cI am currently making payments with them to satisfy this debt.\u201d \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAbout two years ago, Applicant bought a house with someone else (Tr. 33). She \nwas living with the person who purchased the residence with her (Tr. 51). On January \n28, 2009, she moved out of the house (Tr. 36). She obtained a court order of protection \nagainst him (Tr. 51). In September 2009, she signed a quitclaim deed (Tr. 33). Her \nDecember 12, 2008, credit report shows a mortgage loan of $175,000, which was \nborrowed in November 2008 (GE 4). There is no evidence that this mortgage debt is \ndelinquent.  \n \nApplicant paid the three non-SOR judgments listed on her January 10, 2008, SF-\n86 for $800, $500, $300 (Tr. 45-48; GE 1). She planned to pay the SOR debts (Tr. 34, \n35). However, as of the date of her hearing, she has not paid her SOR creditors \nanything during the last two years (Tr. 34). She did not provide any written payment \nplans, or other documentation showing her plan to resolve her SOR debts. She does \nnot have any current credit cards (Tr. 38). \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from the contractor has increased from about $27,000 \nin 2007 to about $34,000 now (Tr. 52). Her net monthly salary is about $2,160 (Tr. 56). \nShe receives $1,050 monthly in child-support payments (Tr. 57). Her part-time \nemployment as a bartender pays about $250 monthly (Tr. 57, 71). Applicant\u2019s monthly \nexpenses are about $3,060 (Tr. 62). Her remainder after expenses is about $400 (Tr. \n63). She has about $200 in the bank (Tr. 67). A roommate recently moved into her \napartment, and she hopes the roommate will contribute $300 monthly towards their rent \n(Tr. 66-67).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary before 2007 was about $30,000 (Tr. 53). She has never \nbeen unemployed (Tr. 55). She received some financial counseling and has generated \na budget (Tr. 70-71). \n  \nCharacter evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from 2002 to 2004, described her as a trustworthy and \nresponsible person (AE A). Applicant had access to sensitive medical information, \nsocial security numbers, and payment information and never mishandled or abused that \naccess to information (AE A).  \n \nApplicant assisted a coworker during July 2004 to June 2007 with making travel \narrangements, and as part of her duties, Applicant was entrusted with credit cards and \nsensitive financial information (AE B). Her coworker was confident that she is a \ntrustworthy and responsible position. \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor during July 2004 to June 2007 noted she was often trusted \nwith sensitive personal and financial information (AE C). He described her as a \ntrustworthy and responsible employee (AE C).     \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at the defense contractor from June 2007 to the present \nindicates she has been promoted twice and is a tremendous asset to her employer (AE \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nD). She routinely handles sensitive personal and financial information (AE D). Applicant \nis a \u201cvery efficient, loyal and trustworthy employee.\u201d (AE D). \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The Appeal Board has noted that an \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case \nthat Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt \nis also documented in her OPM interview, her responses to DOHA interrogatories, her \nSOR response, and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors \nwere paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She has made insufficient progress \npaying or resolving her SOR debts, which now total about $17,000. None of the SOR \ndebts are paid. Her delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her financial problems \ninitially resulted from underemployment and divorce.3 She does not receive full \nmitigating credit because she did not establish that she acted with sufficient initiative to \nresolve her delinquent debts. She has been divorced since 2001, and her largest debt, \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($7,595), resulted from a credit card account opened in 2004 that \nresulted in a judgment against her in June 2005. SOR debt 1.a cannot be attributed to \nher divorce. She did not provide documentation showing her requests to creditors to \nstart payment plans. She has not contacted her SOR creditors for about two years.  \n   \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Although Applicant received some financial \ncounseling and generated a budget, she did not show any reduction in her SOR debts, \neven though she learned about the security significance of her delinquent debts during \nher OPM interview on March 17, 2008. She has not sufficiently demonstrated the \nfinancial self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve her SOR debts. There are not \n\u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d She does not \nreceive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because she did not establish good faith4 in the \nresolution of her SOR debts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because of the lack of documentation supporting \nApplicant\u2019s dispute of any debts. However, under all the circumstances, I did mitigate \nher debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for a $581 cell phone account. She explained that the cell phone \ncompany promised that she would not have to pay roaming charges after she moved. \nThen after she moved the cell phone company improperly billed her for roaming \ncharges at her new residence.       \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Although her debts initially resulted from \nunderemployment and divorce, she has made little progress the last two years resolving \nher SOR debts. She did not pay any of her SOR debts. She did not make an initial \npayment on any payment plans on any of her SOR debts for the last two years.      \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nThe whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance at this time. Applicant\u2019s supervisors noted Applicant\u2019s excellent work \nperformance. She is a diligent, hard working, and dedicated employee. She was candid \nand forthright about her financial history. Her financial problems initially resulted \nbecause of underemployment and her divorce in 2001. The government is well aware of \nher financial problems, and her financial problems do not render her vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. Applicant is a capable, reliable, and dedicated \nemployee.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time.  I have resolved SOR debt 1.d for Applicant because of her credible account \ndescribing why she does not owe the cell phone company. She still has five unresolved \nSOR debts, totaling about $17,000. She does not have a debt consolidation plan and \nhas not set up payment plans with the five SOR creditors. Her efforts to address her five \nremaining SOR delinquent debts for the last two years have been inadequate, and \nfinancial considerations concerns are not mitigated at this time.       \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors,\u201d5 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nApplicant provided strong character references, and there is no evidence of prior \ncriminal conduct, security violations, or any other non-financial security concerns. If \nApplicant resolves the five remaining delinquent SOR debts (for example, if she has \nwell-established payment plans on each debt), and has no misconduct or other new, \nadverse information raising any disqualifying condition(s), her security clearance should \nbe approved a year after the date of this decision. \n \n \n \n5See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 28, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on June 21, 2005\n(Government Exhibit 1). On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 26, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 29, 2009. This case was assigned to me on July 2, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 14, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September\n10, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\n\n2\nApplicant Exhibits A through K, also without objection. Applicant asked that the record\nremain open for the receipt of additional documents. The Applicant submitted Applicant\nExhibit L on September 21, 2009, and it was admitted without objection. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing on September 21, 2009, and the record closed on that date.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 60 and divorced. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and, therefore, at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., and 1.g. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e.,\nand 1.f.\nApplicant testified that the majority of his financial problems occurred in\nconnection with the divorce from his ex-wife. (Applicant Exhibits D, F, G, and L at 45-54;\nTranscript at 75-79.)\n 1.a.\nApplicant denied that he currently owed a credit card company $7,929 for\na judgment. The record shows that a garnishment was issued against Applicant\u2019s pay\nand documentary evidence shows that this debt was paid in full. (Applicant Exhibits H,\nand L at 3-4; Transcript at 38-46.)\n1.b.\nApplicant denied that he currently owed a utility company $146 for a past\ndue account. He submitted a paid receipt from the creditor, showing they had been paid\nin full in May 2009. (Applicant Exhibit B; Transcript at 46-47.)\n1.c.\nApplicant admitted that he owed $8,378 for a past due credit card account.\nThe current collection agency had obtained a judgment, but the Applicant made a\npayment arrangement with the creditor. He submitted evidence showing that since\nDecember 2008 he had been making consistent monthly payments to the creditor in\nfulfilment of that arrangement. (Applicant Exhibit C, and L at 5-14; Transcript at 47-57.)\n1.d.\nApplicant denied that he owed $174 for a debt to a bank. Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife forged his name on an instant loan check from his bank. He disputed this debt to\nthe credit reporting agencies, and it has been deleted. (Applicant Exhibit D; Transcript at\n57-58.)\n1.e.\nApplicant denied owing a bank $3,275 on a past due credit card account.\nHe disputed the account to the bank, stating that he was not the owner of the account.\n\n3\nThe bank has confirmed in writing that his ex-wife is the sole owner of the account.\n(Applicant Exhibit E; Transcript at 47-53, 82-85.)\n1.f.\nApplicant denied that he owed $4,712 for a debt to a payday loan\ncompany. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife forged his name on an instant loan check from this\ncompany. He disputed this debt to the credit reporting agencies, and it has been\ndeleted. (Applicant Exhibit D; Transcript at 59-60.)\n1.g.\nThis is the same debt as that set forth in 1.c., above. (Government Exhibit\n9 at 1; Transcript at 47-57.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submits that his current financial situation is stable. The most recent\ncredit report in the record shows that Applicant has no past due debts, other than 1.c.,\nwhich he is currently paying. (Government Exhibit 9; Transcript at 60-76.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\n\n4\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, had substantial past-due debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\n5\n\u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nApplicant=s financial difficulties arose primarily because of a contentious divorce. He\ndocumented serious and long-standing attempts to resolve his past due debts. The\nrecord shows that he has paid his legitimate debts, and that he has properly disputed\ndebts, which are paid or are not his. At all times he has acted responsibly. These two\nmitigating conditions apply.\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. As stated above,\nseveral have been paid. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable. Applicant\u2019s current\nfinancial situation is stable. He is able to pay his current indebtedness in a timely\nmanner. I find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had some\nfinancial problems, but his current financial condition is stable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), I\nhave considered the facts of the Applicant\u2019s debt history. As stated at length above,\nmuch of this was brought about because of a divorce. Based on the record, I find that\nthere have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, I find\nthat there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8)); and that there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \n\n6\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMichael F. O\u2019Connor, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 14, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July\n14, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under\nGuideline E was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion,\nwe affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a systems analyst\nworking for a Defense contractor.  He has a history of significant drug abuse, including the abuse\nof marijuana, cocaine, opiates, heroin, and Percocet (without a prescription).  This conduct\ncontinued after Applicant had been granted a security clearance in 2006.  His last instance of drug\nabuse was in 2007.  Applicant received in-patient drug abuse treatment and, upon his successful\ncompletion, was discharged with a recommended plan for continued out-patient care.  He has\nfollowed that plan, receiving counseling from a psychologist.  He has also attended Alcoholics\nAnonymous meetings to address difficulties with alcohol consumption.  \nWhen he completed his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to\na question inquiring if he had illegally used controlled substances within the previous seven years.\nThis answer was false, due to the drug abuse described above.  The Judge found that, under the\ncircumstances of this case, this false answer was deliberate.\nApplicant\u2019s false answer to the SCA was alleged under Guideline E and also under Guideline\nJ.  The Judge found against Applicant under the former, but he cleared him under the latter.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is inconsistent, in that, having found the false\nanswer to have been mitigated under Guideline J, the Judge should have reached a similar\nconclusion under Guideline E.\nHowever, previous decisions by the Appeal Board have stated that an SOR allegation may\nbe included under more than one Guideline and may be given independent weight under each.\nFurthermore, a finding of mitigation under one Guideline does not compel a similar finding under\nanother.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2005); ISCR Case No. 04-90251\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007).  In considering an applicant\u2019s claim that a Judge has treated two\nGuidelines inconsistently, we will examine the record and the Directive to determine if there is a\nrational basis for the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Guideline E security concern includes the following language: \u201cOf special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process . . .\u201d  Directive,\nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 15.  Similar language does not appear in the security concern under Guideline J.  See\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 30.  This language places an applicant\u2019s lack of truthfulness or candor in\nthe security clearance process at the heart of Guideline E, and the Judge cited it in his decision.\nApplicant\u2019s false statement about his drug use (which use was, at the time he completed the SCA,\n\n1Applicant testified that he had attended AA meetings even prior to his entry into the drug treatment program.\nHe stated that, upon occasion, he would tell his wife that he was going to an AA meeting when in actuality he would\njoin up with an acquaintance and use illegal drugs.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t every time, but it was certainly convenient for me to . .\n. say I\u2019m going to an AA meeting, and that would give me an hour to go use drugs, and then return.\u201d  Tr. at 49-50.  See\nalso Applicant Interview Summary, included in Answers to Interrogatories: \u201cWhile attending AA meetings, [Applicant]\nmet a guy who . . . was not clean.  The guy started offering him drugs . . . He was skipping AA meetings to do drugs with\nthis guy.  He would tell his wife he was going to an AA meeting, but was actually hanging out with this guy and using\ndrugs.\u201d  \n3\nan ongoing course of conduct), was of a nature to frustrate the proper functioning of his clearance\ninvestigation.  This is a sufficient reason for the Judge to evaluate the false statement differently\nunder Guideline E than he did under J.  Additionally, we note record evidence that he had made false\nstatements to his wife.1  These statements do not appear to constitute criminal conduct, but they are\nrelevant to a whole-person evaluation of Guideline E and, therefore, provide another reason for the\nJudge to have examined that Guideline in a different context from the way he treated Guideline J.\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

It was issued pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn a January 11, 2010, response, Applicant admitted all allegations set forth in\nthe SOR and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on March 18, 2010.\nThe parties proposed a hearing date of May 4, 2010. DOHA issued a notice setting that\ndate for the hearing on April 13, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled.\nRepresented by counsel, Applicant gave testimony and presented nine documents,\nwhich were accepted into evidence without objection as exhibits (Ex.) A-I. Department\nCounsel offered two documents, which were admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-2 without\nobjection. \nJuly 14, 2010\n\n Tr. 9, 72.\n      1\n Tr. 67-69.\n      2\n Tr. 68-70.\n      3\n Tr. 71; Exs. 3 (Government\u2019s brief) and J (Applicant\u2019s brief).\n      4\n There was no constructive need to amend the SOR. Both Applicant\u2019s testimony and his Response to the\n      5\nSOR clearly reflect that Applicant\u2019s dates of drug use extended past the date he was granted a security\nclearance. Consequently, such facts were already inherently relevant and material to any examination of a\ncase under the guideline at issue. The SOR is an administrative pleading. It is not held to the strict standards\nof a criminal indictment. See ISCR Case No. 03-27157 at 2 (App. Bd. May 11, 2006).\n2\nBefore the parties presented their cases, the Government noted that the SOR,\nunder Guideline E at allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, reflected an incorrect date for\nApplicant\u2019s SCA. The SCA indicated that the application was signed in July 2006, when,\nin fact, the proper month was February. On motion, the discrepancy was corrected.  \n1\nThe Government also moved to correct the SOR under Guideline E and\neliminate allegation \u00b6 2.b, alleging that Applicant falsely answered \u201cno\u201d to a SCA\nquestion asking whether he had illegally used drugs while maintaining a security\nclearance, and noting that Applicant was granted a security clearance in November\n2006. Because the SCA predated the Applicant\u2019s security clearance, and since the\ndates for both Applicant\u2019s SCA and security clearance were noted during the parties\u2019\ncases-in-chief, the motion was granted without objection.  \n2\nThe Government then moved to add an additional allegation under Guideline H\nthat Applicant \u201cused illegal drugs after having been granted a DOD security clearance\non November 14, 2006,\u201d as SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e.  Applicant objected to this addition,\n3\nhaving come after testimony had concluded. Inasmuch as it was an admitted and\nmaterial fact clearly relevant to my consideration of the allegations and whole-person\nanalysis, the proposed amendment added little to the proceeding or my consideration of\nthe case. Acknowledging the Appeal Board\u2019s liberality regarding my discretion in\ngranting such motions to amend, however, the parties were provided the opportunity to\npresent written argument on the motion. The Government\u2019s brief was received on May\n5, 2010; Applicant\u2019s brief was received on May 17, 2010.  I considered both positions in\n4\nthe matter. Both arguments had merit. Inasmuch as Applicant already had been\nprovided an opportunity to respond to the facts underlying the proposed amendment,\nhowever,  the SOR was amended to include SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e.5\nThe transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on May 11, 2010. The record\nwas closed on May 17, 2010. Based on a full review of the testimony, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden of mitigating security concerns related\nto the guidelines raised.

The experience scared him to the\n      6\nextent that he did not use it again until his mid-teens.\nTr. 64.\n      7\n Tr. 19. Applicant\u2019s use of Percocet started after he was prescribed the drug for migraines and which he\n      8\nused to help him sleep. Its use, however, led to an addiction that extended past his prescription supply.\n Tr. 48.\n      9\n Tr. 9, 71-72. The SOR erroneously stated that Applicant signed the SCA in July, not February.\n      10\n See Response to the SOR and Tr. 17. \u201cSection 24: Your use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity. a.

He\nwas hired by his present employer in 2006. He is a graduate of a technical institute. He\nis married and has two children. Applicant has a history of using illegal and controlled\ndrugs. He used marijuana with varying frequency, to include, at times, daily use, from\nabout 1980 until April 2007.  From about 1988 until July 2007, he used cocaine with\n6\nvarying frequency, sometimes as often as twice a week. Applicant used opiates on\noccasion between 2001 and 2007. He used heroin one to three times a week between\nabout May and June 2007.  Between 2006 and 2007, he used Percocet without a valid\n7\nprescription.  He purchased cocaine and heroin on several occasions during the times\n8\nhe used those drugs. Applicant never used drugs on the job, nor went to work under the\ninfluence of drugs. He hid his drug use, often using them as his family slept.9\nMuch of Applicant\u2019s drug use continued after he completed his February 2006\nsecurity clearance application (SCA),  on which he intentionally answered \u201cno\u201d to\n10\nSection 24a, which essentially asked whether he had illegally used any controlled\nsubstances within the preceding seven years.

This covertly continued on various occasions until early July 2007, when\n14\nApplicant realized his level of desperation. Although he wanted to quit using drugs, his\nguilt over his drug use and the deceit involved in covering it up somehow fueled his\nneed for drugs.  He quit using all drugs and immediately disclosed his drug abuse and\n15\ndeceit to his wife and mother. Applicant quickly sought assistance regarding his drug\nabuse. As he began treatment, he had his wife inform his security officer of his drug\nissues and need for medical treatment.  From July 13-17, 2007, he underwent\n16\ndetoxification at a credentialed medical center.  This  was followed by a July 17, 2007,\n17\nto August 14, 2007, rehabilitation period at an intensive in-patient substance abuse\ntreatment center, where he was diagnosed with \u201cOpioid and Cocaine Dependence\n(continuous) and Alcohol and Cannabis Dependence (in remission).\u201d  On discharge,\n18\nhis prognosis was considered positive if he followed an out-patient treatment program.19\nApplicant followed that program.\nAfter his release, Applicant concentrated on his rehabilitation. He found support\nthrough two out-patient options. He obtained private counseling with a licensed\npsychologist, with whom he conferred once a week for six to eight months. He\ncompleted that counseling at the end of 2008.  He also began attending a new AA\n20\nmeeting venue, where he diligently attended AA daily for the first 90 days after his\nrelease.  Since that time, he has regularly attended AA about four to five times a\n21\nweek.  He now sponsors others in his AA group. Although his employer was informed\n22\nof his drug use in July 2007, Applicant personally informed the government of his need\nfor drug treatment during his first post-rehab investigatory interview, which occurred in\nMarch 2008.  Although there is no notation that he was asked about specific dates of\n23\n\n Ex. H, supra, note 18.\n      24\n Tr. 28-29; Ex.

He has\n25\ncomplemented his aftercare measures by avoiding all high-risk situations regarding\nalcohol and drugs. He now concentrates on running and health. Applicant considers\nhimself a \u201cchanged man.\u201d  Consistent with AA\u2019s 10  step of its 12-step program, he\n26\nth\ncontinues to \u201ctake personal inventory and when [he is/was] wrong, promptly\u201d admit it.27\nHe discussed his problems at length with his security officer.  He expressed contrition\n28\nfor hiding his addictions and providing a false answer on his SCA.   He acknowledges\n29\nand regrets his past drug use and the behavior his addictions promoted.\nMoreover, Applicant remains alcohol and drug-free.  He has had no relapses\n30\nsince he quit using controlled substances in July 2007.  There is no alcohol in his\n31\nhome and his wife does not use alcohol. His family is highly supportive of Applicant\u2019s\nsobriety. He always distances himself from alcohol when it is present at a function, such\nas a wedding or a social gathering.  He has not attended any functions at which drugs\n32\nwere available.  The physician that initially referred Applicant for in-patient\n33\nrehabilitation recently noted no indication of alcohol or drug abuse, opining that\nApplicant\u2019s \u201clikelihood of relapse would be very low as long as he continues on the path\nthat he has maintained since the successful completion of his rehab program.\u201d  It is\n34\nApplicant\u2019s express intent to continue that path, maintain sobriety, and not use illegal\ndrugs in the future.  He signed a notarized statement of intent to continue to abstain\n35\nfrom illegal drugs and not abuse prescription drugs that includes his consent to the\n\n Ex. A (Statement of Intent, dated Jan. 11, 2010).\n      36\n Ex. E (Management letter, dated Jan. 5, 2010). The author\u2019s letter notes that she is aware that Applicant\n      37\nwas a substance abuser until July 2007 and failed to report that abuse on his 2006 SCA. Her comments detail\nhis entire performance from June 2006 to January 5, 2010. Consequently, her assessment and\nrecommendation reflect a professional appraisal of Applicant extending beyond his current work performance.\n Id.\n      38\n Id.\n      39\n Tr. 35. In doing so, the officer noted, \u201cI do not take this lightly and want to share that this is the first letter\n      40\nin my 10 years in security which I have written for anyone who has been a substance abuser.\u201d \n Ex.

In depicting his work record since June\n2006, his superior describes him as a having \u201cestablished an excellent working\nrelationship with the customer of the program he supports and has shown loyalty to the\ncompany.\u201d  She further describes him as a \u201cmodel employee\u201d who is also a\n37\n\u201ctrustworthy, reliable, and skilled employee.\u201d  She noted his \u201cspotless\u201d attendance\n38\nrecord and willingness to work long hours.  His employer\u2019s corporate facility security\n39\nofficer volunteered to write on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  She wrote a positive letter of\n40\nsupport, acknowledging his past problems, SCA misrepresentations, rehabilitation, and\ncurrent focus.  All evidence indicates that he was and remains an excellent employee\n41\nwho has successfully overcome his addictions.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      42\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      43\n Id.\n      44\n Id.\n      45\n7\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n42\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n43\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n44\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.45\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the most\npertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to these AGs that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\n\n AG  \u00b6 24.\n      46\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      47\n Id. at  \u00b6 24(b).\n      48\n See note 14.\n      49\n Given the facts in this case, this disqualifying condition would apply regardless of the addition of allegation\n      50\n\u00b6 1.e to the SOR.\n8\nrules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances,\n46\nand include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other\nsubstances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\n47\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n48\nApplicant admitted he used a variety of illegal drugs and used Percocet without a\nprescription at various times and with varying frequency until early July 2007, after he\nwas granted a security clearance in November 2006. He also admitted he illegally\npurchased such substances during that time. While undergoing treatment in 2007, he\nwas diagnosed as being dependent on opioids, cocaine, and cannabis at a respected\nin-patient medical center focused on alcohol and substance abuse.  Consequently,\n49\nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 25 (a) (any drug abuse), AG \u00b6 25 (c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,\nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia), either AG \u00b6 25 (d) (diagnosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist)\nof drug abuse or drug dependence) or AG \u00b6 25(e) (evaluation of drug abuse or drug\ndependence by a licenses clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\ndrug treatment program), and AG \u00b6 25 (g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a\nsecurity clearance)   apply.\n50\nApplicant started using marijuana and cocaine recreationally as a teen. After\nsuffering from migraines, he began to abuse Percocet and other drugs. His drug use\ncontinued until July 2007. While his treatment has been diligently and successfully\npursued and his current prognosis is good, such facts do not give rise to Drug\nInvolvement Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 26 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nSince undergoing detoxification, receiving treatment, and following his post-\ntreatment program, Applicant has diligently disassociated himself from people, venues,\nand events associated with drugs. Such facts give rise to AG \u00b6 26 (b)(1) (disassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts) and AG \u00b6 26 (b)(2) (changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used).\nApplicant has been drug-free for nearly three years. He has changed his\nenvironment, avoided relapse, concentrated on his health, and currently has a positive\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      51\n Id.\n      52\n9\nprognosis. Given the fact he abused drugs for over 20 years, three years may not be an\nappropriate gauge of his successful abstinence, despite his recent success at\nmaintaining sobriety. There is insufficient evidence to raise AG \u00b6 26 (b)(3) (an\nappropriate period of abstinence). However, Applicant has not only expressed his intent\nnot to use drugs in the future, he has also signed a statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of any security clearance he should be granted should he ever resort to\nillegal drugs or abuse legal, but controlled, medications in the future. Consequently, AG\n\u00b6 26 (b)(4) (a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation) applies. \nIn light of Applicant\u2019s past drug abuse, he has demonstrated exhaustive efforts in\nseeking and maintaining his current drug-free life. He was hospitalized for\ndetoxification, attended an intensive drug treatment at a well-regarded in-patient\nmedical treatment center, attended psychiatric counseling for over half a year following\nhis treatment, and diligently attended AA. Today, he remains active with his AA group,\nattends AA four to five times a week, and is a sponsor to others seeking to be equally\nsubstance-free. He has rigidly followed all after-care advice and recently been given a\npositive prognosis by the physician who initially referred him for treatment. He has the\nfull support of his family, employer, and AA associates. He is living a life supportive of\nhis needs and goals. He has no intention of returning to drugs, and signed a statement\nof intent with automatic revocation of security clearance for any lapses in the future.\nThere is little more he can do to rehabilitate himself. His efforts have been personally\nrewarding and demonstrably effective. Given these considerations, the mitigating\nconditions raised, and the facts of record, drug involvement security concerns are\nmitigated.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n51\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  Here,\n52\nApplicant denied having used illegal drugs since the age of 16 or in the seven years\npreceding certification of a February 2006 SCA. He also failed to disclose his purchase\nof illegal or controlled drugs. Such facts are sufficient to raise Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities). Consequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to\nmitigate the resultant security concerns.\n\n10\nApplicant denied his use of illegal drugs, his abuse of controlled drugs, and his\npurchase of both forms of drugs when he completed his February 2006 SCA. He failed\nto inform his employer of his drug use and purchase until July 2007, after he had been\ngranted a security clearance and as he was seeking immediate medical treatment. It is\nnoted in DOHA case law that disclosures that can invoke Personal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith effort to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted by with the facts) should\nnot be protracted. Consequently, this mitigating condition does not apply. \nApplicant did not merely experiment with drugs in the past. His long-term abuse\nof drugs involved many illegal and controlled substances, and was intentionally covert.\nWhen he certified his SCA answers, he did so in the knowledge that falsity was grounds\nfor criminal action under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. He only volunteered the truth of his drug\nabuse and SCA falsity when facing a prolonged period of detoxification and treatment.\nTherefore, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s eventual honesty and disclosure must be commended, as must be\nhis success in beating a drug abuse history extending over 20 years. Indeed, given his\nextensive drug history, his efforts demonstrate remarkable diligence, commitment, and\nperseverance. Since making the commitment to quit drugs, he has been completely\nforthcoming regarding his drug abuse and history, assuaging the feelings of guilt he\nonce endured. For three years, he has been open about his drug abuse with his wife,\nhis family, and his employer. AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies. None\nof the other mitigating conditions apply. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s successful recovery was extraordinary and his candid\ntestimony was heartfelt, the AG specifically notes that \u201cany failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest. Consequently,\nheightened scrutiny is warranted. The issue here is not about Applicant\u2019s abuse of\ndrugs, but his failure to disclose it. This failure was compounded when he continued to\nkeep his \u201clittle secret\u201d after being granted a security clearance. His drug abuse and\nfalse SCA answer were not disclosed until the prospect of a protracted absence from\nwork was anticipated for detoxification and treatment. That occurred less than three\nyears ago, in mid-July 2007. Given the heightened scrutiny required in this situation,\ninsufficient time has passed to reestablish the level of trust and candor expected of one\nseeking \naccess \nto \nclassified \nor \nsensitive \ninformation. \nWhile \nApplicant\u2019s\naccomplishments put him on the path toward restoring that level of trustworthiness, it is\npremature to conclude that personal conduct security concerns have been dispelled.\nWhen, as here, personal conduct security concerns remain, resolution under the clearly\nconsistent standard must be made in favor of the national security.\n\n AG \u00b6 30.\n      53\n Ex. 1 (SCA), citing to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n      54\n11\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nThe concern under this guideline is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d53\nHere, Applicant illegally abused drugs, a habit that continued after he was granted a\nsecurity clearance. He obtained and used controlled medication without a prescription.\nHe also falsely denied his drug use on his SCA. In completing and certifying his SCA\nanswers as true, Applicant was advised that \u201ca knowingly and willfully false statement\non this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.\u201d  Such acts constitute\n54\ncriminal conduct and Applicant has admitted the conduct alleged. Therefore, Criminal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply.\nConsequently, it is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security concerns raised.\nApplicant denied illegal drug use on his February 2006 SCA. That abuse\ncontinued after he was granted a security clearance in November 2006. He did not quit\nabusing drugs until July 2007. That same month, he had his wife inform his employer\nthrough its security officer of his drug abuse and need for treatment, thus giving notice\nof his false SCA answer and of his drug dependence. In addition, when interviewed by\ninvestigators for the Defense Department in March 2008, he disclosed the fact that he\nhad abused drugs and sought appropriate. He has repeatedly demonstrated remorse in\nhis poor judgment and for concealing the truth of his drug dependence from his family\nand the investigative process.\nApplicant provided a false answer on his SOR in February 2006 and he quit\nusing illegal drugs in July 2007. For the past three years, his life has been devoid of\nfurther criminal acts. He has undergone exhaustive rehabilitation regarding his former\ndrug problem. He has been thoroughly candid about both his drug use and efforts to\ngain and remain drug-free. He has made significant changes in his life, now focusing on\nhis health and his family. He has excelled at work and earned the respect of his\nassociates. He has not only participated in AA, but has become a sponsor for others in\nhis community. While he cannot erase either his past illegal drug use or his SCA\nfalsification, Applicant is contrite. He has spent three drug-free years honestly trying to\nmake amends for his past transgressions and demonstrate straight-forward and honest\njudgment. Given such factors, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 32(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community service) apply. Criminal\nconduct security concerns are mitigated.   \n\n12\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible man who has successfully fought a drug abuse problem\nthat has plagued him his entire adult lifetime. Contributing to his already existent drug\nabuse were migraines and sleep problems that led to his abuse of prescription drugs.\nHe voluntarily sought extensive drug treatment when his drug abuse and his guilt over\nconcealing it became overwhelming. He is now in recovery, lives a different lifestyle,\nhas a positive medical prognosis, and is a strict adherent of AA. He is now forthright\nabout his past drug problems and an active AA sponsor, helping others in need. He\ngenuinely regrets lying about his drug use. Given his remorse and the three years of\ndiligence and commitment demonstrated thus far, there is little likelihood he will\nrelapse, fail himself and his family, and return to drugs.\nSimilar remorse was demonstrated and efforts made to compensate for\nApplicant\u2019s past criminal conduct, both in terms of his drug use and failure to disclose\nthat drug use. In terms of criminal conduct, there is little more he can do to correct his\npast and start anew. His recent past is devoid of further criminal conduct, and there is\nevery indication that he will continue AA\u2019s 10  step in making up for his past.\nth\nRemaining are the security concerns regarding personal conduct. In light of the\nAG, and given the nature of his SCA falsity, such conduct demands heightened\nscrutiny. Unlike drug involvement and criminal conduct, abstention and self-correction\ndo not necessarily lead to demonstrable rehabilitation. Less than three years have\npassed since Applicant first disclosed the truth about his drug abuse, an act that\nrevealed his untruthfulness on the SCA which provided the basis for his November\n2006 security clearance. While he diligently adheres to the tenets of AA and its\nemphasis on making amends, insufficient time has passed to reestablish the level of\ntrust required of one seeking and maintaining a security clearance. While he is on his\n\n As noted, supra, Subparagraph 2.b was deleted on motion by the Government.\n      55\n13\nway toward reestablishing that trust, there is insufficient evidence to mitigate all\nassociated personal conduct security concerns.

On 17 February 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 16 March 2009, and I convened a hearing 19\nMay 2009.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 19 May 2009.\n2\nJuly 8, 2009\n\nHowever, it appears that the debts at 1.s. and 1.t. are the same debt. Although having different account\n3\nnumbers, the amounts owed are identical.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.b.\u20131.j., 1.u.\u2013x., 1.aa.,\n1.ee\u2013ff., and 1.hh. She is a 32-year-old financial advisor employed by a defense\ncontractor since November 2003. She has been continuously employed since at least\nSeptember 1996, except for a brief period April-June 2001, when she was on maternity\nleave, receiving only disability payments as income. She previously held a clearance in\n1998 and 1999, when she was an on-site contractor employee at two government\nagencies.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 36 delinquent debts\nattributable to Applicant, totaling over $50,000. Applicant admits 19 debts totaling more\nthan $37,000;  she denies 17 debts totaling nearly $13,000. Applicant asserts, without\n3\ncorroboration that she has paid the debts at 1.ff. and 1.hh. She claimed, also without\ncorroboration, that she is making payments on the educational debts at 1.o., 1.p., 1.q.,\nand 1.r. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission (A.E. A) later documented that, as of May\n2009, she had made four payments totaling almost $1,700 on the educational accounts.\nHowever, over $1,300 of this amount was paid through IRS offsets of her tax refunds in\nMarch and June 2008. Applicant made one regular payment in October 2007 by wage\ngarnishment and one regular payment in November 2007 by direct remittance. There\nhave been no credits to the account since June 2008.\nThe remainder of A.E. A documents a judgment that was satisfied in July 2008\nthat Applicant did not correlate to any of the alleged debts. She was also able to\ndocument settlement offers\u2014for discounts of 50% or more\u2014from the creditors at SOR\n1.b., 1.z., and 1.ee, in spring 2009. However, she did not document that she made\npayments on any of the offers. Further, the total indebtedness alleged for those three\ndebts was only $1,100, an insignificant portion of her total debt.\nApplicant attributes her indebtedness to a substantial decline in income while she\nwas on maternity leave from April-June 2001\u2014a period during which she received\napproximately two-thirds of her previous income through medical disability. She also\ncites the fact that she receives no support from her child\u2019s father. Many of the debts she\ndisputes are medical accounts for which she had insurance. However, she did not\ncorroborate her claims that she paid the necessary co-pays and deductibles associated\nwith those expenses. She denies other debts because she does not recognize the\ncreditors, but has not taken into account potential successors-in-interest to the original\ncreditors. When she received the SOR in January 2009, she began sending letters to\nher creditors to establish repayment plans, but had not yet actually established any\nrepayment plans or paid any of the debts.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; ( c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n5\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties dating to at least 2001.  She is not financially sophisticated, and it appears\n5\nfrom the record that if she was not living beyond her means before the birth of her child,\nshe was living very close to that line\u2014with little margin for error. A brief decrease in her\nincome, and the addition of her child to her financial obligations was sufficient to drive\nher into extensive delinquent debt. This suggests that poor financial practices already\nexisted.\n\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n8\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n4\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide little help to Applicant.\nHer financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  Strictly speaking, the problems\n6\nare not largely due to circumstances beyond her control. Pregnancy alone is not such a\ncircumstance, and even concluding that the medical necessity of her maternity leave\nwas unforeseeable, the three-month duration of that decrease in income does not\nreasonably account for the nature and extent of the financial difficulties reflected in her\ncredit reports. In addition, her inability or unwillingness to pursue financial support from\nthe child\u2019s father further demonstrates her naivete regarding financial matters. \nEven if I confine my analysis to the 19 debts she admits, $37,000 in delinquent\ndebt demonstrates just how close to the line or below the line she had to be operating\nbefore her maternity leave. Further, her response has been largely unsatisfactory.  She\n7\nhas not documented her claimed efforts at credit counseling or exploring bankruptcy,\nnor availed herself of any alternative forms of credit counseling. Thus, there is no\nevidence that Applicant has undertaken effective financial counseling. She has not\ndemonstrated that the problem has been brought substantially under control.  The\n8\npayments that have been paid have not been paid in a timely, good-faith manner.9\nIndeed, the only corroborated payments were for her educational loans, were largely\neffected through garnishment or IRS offset, and most recently occurred in June 2008.\nWhatever efforts she has made to address her poor finances have been sporadic,\nineffectual, and largely undocumented. The record does not indicate when, if ever, her\nfinancial situation will be settled enough for her to make clear progress on her\ndelinquent debts. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. Consideration of the whole\nperson factors yields no different result.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 15, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 8, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz,\nJr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant also requests that the decision in her case be delayed six months, presumably leaving the record open\n1\nso that her situation can be reevaluated.  The Board does not have the authority to process such a request.

Finding no error, we affirm.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a financial advisor\nemployed by a defense contractor.  She previously held a security clearance in 1998 and 1999.\nApplicant has delinquent debts totaling over $50,000.  Applicant claimed to have paid off\nseveral of these debts, though she provided no corroboration.

Inspired by his grandfather, a veteran of World War II, Applicant joined the military after high school.

The following year, he was charged with Indecent Exposure, Failure to Appear, and Noncompliance with Pretrial Diversion Program. In 1989, he was charged with Public Intoxication. At this point, he started using alcohol in moderation. In 1990, he was assigned to active duty and married his girlfriend.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within \nthe Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nOn January 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the allegations raised and requested a \nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. I was assigned the case on March 4, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant proposed an April 1, 2009, hearing, and a Notice of \nHearing was issued to that effect on March 16, 2009. \n \n \n1 \n \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and offered 14 \ndocuments, which I accepted into the record without objection as Exhibits (Exs.) A-N. Also \naccepted into the record without objection were 10 documents from Department Counsel, \nmarked as Exs. 1-10. Applicant was given leave to supplement the record after the close of \nthe hearing. A deadline of April 16, 2009, was given. A post-hearing package of \nsubmissions, dated April 13, 2009, was forwarded to Department Counsel. On April 15, \n2009, I received a copy of that submission and a statement from Department Counsel that \nhe had no objection to its contents. Those documents were accepted into the record as \nExs. O-T and the record was closed on April 15, 2009, the same day the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe proceeding was received.  Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and \ntestimony, security clearance is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old physicist who has worked for the same defense contractor \nsince December 2007. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics after serving \napproximately 12 years in the United States military. Divorced, Applicant has no children.  \n \nInspired by his grandfather, a veteran of World War II, Applicant joined the military \nafter high school. Initially enlisted as a reservist, he started experimenting with alcohol and \nwas charged with Illegal Possession of Alcohol in 1986. The following year, he was charged \nwith Indecent Exposure, Failure to Appear, and Noncompliance with Pretrial Diversion \nProgram. In 1989, he was charged with Public Intoxication. At this point, he started using \nalcohol in moderation. In 1990, he was assigned to active duty and married his girlfriend. \n \nApplicant was aware that he and his wife were unprepared for marriage, but it was \nhis intent to adhere to his vows.1 While stationed abroad, he found that she was unfaithful. \nOne evening in 1992, an argument during dinner turned into a food fight. The police were \ncalled and Applicant was charged with Assault. As a consequence, he and his wife went to \ncounseling. Another Assault charge followed in 1993, for which he was reprimanded by his \nsuperiors. His wife eventually left Applicant and returned to the United States. Initially \ndespondent, he turned his attentions to a young local woman. Through her, he \nexperimented with marijuana. That use led to his November 1994 non-judicial punishment \nfor Wrongful Possession and Use of Marijuana, for which he was reduced in rank from E4 \nto E3 and forfeited $500 for one month. He was assigned to a special project shortly \nthereafter, which led to his returning to his former rank.  \n \nWhen it came time to reenlist, however, Applicant chose to return home, rejoin his \nestranged wife, work on his marriage, and attend college. Around this time, Applicant \nbegan suffering from a series of medical issues, including significant weight gain, high \nblood pressure, heart arrhythmia, severe sleep apnea, and other stress-related problems \nadversely affected by the use of stimulants such as alcohol. Despite his attempts, the \ncouple was divorced in 1997. Upon graduation from college, he found civilian employment \n \n1 Tr. 20-21. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                \nwith the military. In the interim, in 1998, he was charged with Attempting to Elude/Failure to \nComply with Police Officer Signal. \n \nIn 2005, Applicant was enjoying his first year of civilian employment with the military, \nearning about $52,000. He bought a new truck and a motorcycle, acquired two credit cards, \nand underwent necessary gastric bypass surgery to address his continuing medical \nproblems. Ready to start a new life as he proceeded to lose over 150 pounds, improve his \nhealth, and reduce his propensity for further cardiac-related problems, he discovered his \nwork location was subject to a base closure. Rather than having his contract renewed, he \nwas unemployed by 2006. Consequently, he had no income to pay for his vehicles or those \nmedical bills not covered by health insurance. It cost him nearly $3,700, applied to his credit \ncards, to pack his possession and move back to his hometown.   \n \nWhen he returned home in early 2006, Applicant eventually found work, but his \nwages were approximately half of what they were previously. The stress of returning home \nand dealing with his bills was intense. He could not make the minimum payments on his \ncredit cards despite the fact he cut his expenses to the minimum. With his physical \ncondition improving, he tried supplementing his income by working construction. Jobs, \nhowever, were sparse. He also tried to reach settlements on his credit card debt, but he \nwas unsuccessful. By June 2006, despite his better judgment, he had turned to alcohol \nbecause he felt increasingly humiliated for having to reach out to family and friends for \nfinancial help.2 In 2007, he was found guilty of Public Intoxication, sentenced to four days in \nprison, fined, and put on one year of probation. Related charges alleging he possessed the \nmarijuana found at the scene were dropped, but were pursued against his companion. \nLater that year, he was also found guilty of Operating a Vehicle Blood Alcohol of .08 or \nMore, sentenced to six months probation, fined, ordered to attend an Alcohol Education \nclass, had his license suspended for 90 days, and ordered to serve two of 60 days \nsentenced in jail.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, a recovering alcoholic who has stayed alcohol-free for three \ndecades, was concerned. Through her care and influence, he quit drinking alcohol, joined \nAlcoholics Anonymous (A.A.), and focused on his health.3 He continues to be active with \nthat organization to date, both as an attendee and as an active volunteer in its outreach. \nAlso, he supports various other related organizations. In 2008, he was examined and \nassessed by the director of a county alcohol and drug program. That program is state-\ncertified to provide assessments and referrals. It was concluded that despite past \nsituational crises, Applicant does not currently show signs of alcohol or drug dependence.4 \nApplicant was offered a job with his current employer in December 2007 and started work \nwith that organization in January 2008. \n \n \n2 Tr. 33. \n3 Tr. 38, 44-45. \n4 Response to the SOR, attachment. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                \nAt issue in the SOR are 16 allegations, each representing a delinquent debt noted in \ncredit reports from October 22, 2008, March 8, 2008, or January 19, 2006.

Through one such \nplan, he has made the progress noted above.18 His debt will be increased when about \n$66,000 in student loans become ripe for repayment.19 He has approximately $4,000 in \nsavings to use as a \u201cnegotiation tactic\u201d when he pursues settlements.20 \n \nCurrently, Applicant earns about $72,500 per year. He pays about $1,400 for rent, \nabout $485 for utilities, $200 for miscellaneous, $1,000 toward automobile balances, and \n$500 for groceries. He claims a net remainder at the end of the month of approximately \n$1,000.21 Applicant has been reserving his monthly net surplus and savings because he is \nconcerned what will happen to him financially if he loses his job.22  \n \n \n \n14 Ex.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided \ndrawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. The Government must \npresent evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d23 The burden \nof proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.24 The ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision is on the applicant.25  \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d26 Any reasonable \n \n23 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995). \n24 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n25 ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995). \n26 Id. \n\n \n7 \n \ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must \nbe resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.27  The decision to deny an \nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an \napplicant.28 It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines \nare the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case: \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or an inability to live \nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.29 \n \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.30  \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption. The Concern: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.31  \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement. The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of \na prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as \nmood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and \ninhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal \ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.32  \n \nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those that would mitigate security concerns, \nare set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. \n                                                 \n27 Id. \n28 Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7. \n29 Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18. \n30 AG \u00b6 30. \n31 AG \u00b6 21. \n32 AG \u00b6  24. \n\n \nApplicant\u2019s past criminal activity was mainly related to marital stress, drugs, and \nalcohol. The strife from his marriage ended over a dozen years ago with his divorce from \n8 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGUIDELINE F \n \nApplicant incurred a number of debts over the years, paid some debts, disputed \nsome debts, and some debts remain unaddressed. Consequently, Financial Considerations \nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \nFC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. With such \nconditions raised, the burden is placed on Applicant to overcome the case against him and \nmitigate security concerns.  \n \nA majority of the delinquent debts at issue are the result of a protracted period of \nunemployment, a long and lengthy relocation, and immediate care for serious medical \nconditions. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. \n \nApplicant commenced a year long period of unemployment a little over three and a \nhalf years ago, during which he diligently tried to find secure employment. Since then, he \nhas found employment, including what is currently a steady and reliable position. Although \nclosures, whether of a military base or a business, happen routinely, the declining economy \nhas recently shown signs of improvement. While there are no safeguards guaranteeing him \npermanent employment, his current prospects are improved for continued employment in \nlight of his education and experience. To that extent,  Financial Considerations Mitigating \nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is due some \nconsideration. \n \nSubtracting duplicates, there are 12 delinquent debts at issue. Applicant has paid 5 \nbalances, disputed 2 account entries, and initiated some effort on most of the remaining 6 \ndebts at issue. Although the largest debts remain unresolved, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) \napplies.  \n \n \nGUIDELINE J  \n \nApplicant admits he was charged with or convicted of several criminal acts between \n1986 and 2007. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission \nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted\u201d) apply. \n \n\n \nAs noted in the preceding section, Applicant is remorseful over his past alcohol \nabuse and resolved to continue his sobriety. He has also matured. Accepting his mother\u2019s \n9 \n \nan unfaithful spouse. Since 1998, only one drug offense was charged against Applicant. \nThat marijuana possession charge was dropped, however, when the possessor appeared \nto be Applicant\u2019s companion. There are no facts otherwise establishing he was under the \ninfluence of drugs at the time. Consequently, only two incidents have occurred in over a \ndecade, those which involved alcohol abuse. Those two incidents, however, are sufficient \nto obviate the applicability of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) \n(\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence the \nperson did not commit the act\u201d). \n \nNearly a decade passed between the 2007 alcohol-related incidents and Applicant\u2019s \npast criminal conduct. Less than three years have lapsed since those two alcohol-related \nincidents in 2007, thus making the underlying issue in their regard more amenable to \nscrutiny under Guideline G than under Guideline J. Regardless, for the 2007 incidents, he \nadmits embarrassment and remorse. He also showed career success he attained in the \nintervening years. Additionally, he has since quit using alcohol and become a regular \nmember of A.A. He has become an active advocate against alcohol abuse within his \ncommunity. He was determined to be alcohol-free and not alcohol dependent by a director \nof a certified drug and alcohol treatment facility, who also concluded his past instances of \nalcohol abuse were attributable to adverse circumstances. Aside from these lapses and \nthat period of adverse circumstance, there has been no other cited criminal incident in over \na dozen years and Applicant\u2019s behavioral modifications and intervening maturity should \npreclude recurrence. Moreover, while many applicants demonstrate familial or professional \npressure or support as a safeguard from their future alcohol use or abuse, Applicant has \npresented more compelling facts, potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions for which \nstimulants such as alcohol are specifically contraindicated. CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d) applies. \n \n \nGUIDELINE G \n \nIssues regarding one\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness can arise from unbridled \nalcohol consumption because it can lead to uncontrolled impulses and questionable \njudgment. Applicant admits he was charged or arrested for alcohol-related incidents in his \npast, during the 1986-1998 time-frame. He also admits to two incidents in 2007, when he \nwas significantly worried and blue over his protracted period of unemployment. \nConsequently, Alcohol Consumption (AC) Disqualifying Condition (DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child \nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. With a \ndisqualifying condition thus established, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate related \nsecurity concerns. \n \n\n \n10 \n \nguidance and advice, and with the support of his family, he became an active member of \nA.A. and is now a community advocate against alcohol abuse. Applicant now focuses on \nhis work and adult responsibilities. Within the past year, the director of a certified drug and \nalcohol treatment center rendered a favorable prognosis, attributing Applicant\u2019s 2007 \nalcohol-related incidents to being situation-related. Finally, and most importantly, he now \nappreciates the self-destructive nature of continuing alcohol abuse in the face of his serious \nphysical health problems. Therefore, AC Mitigating Condition (MC)  AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior was infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AC MC AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual \nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if \nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) apply. It is unclear, however, \nwhether AC MC AG \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has completed inpatient or outpatient counseling \nor rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment plan) technically applies, as there is insufficient information in the record \nregarding the treatment center\u2019s director\u2019s qualifications and/or state licensure.  \n \nGUIDELINE H \n \nApplicant admits he was directly or indirectly involved with illegal drugs, albeit in the \npast. Consequently, Drug Involvement (DI) Disqualifying Condition (DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any \ndrug abuse) applies. With a disqualifying condition thus established, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to mitigate security concerns. \n \nApplicant was initially charged with possession of marijuana in 2007, but the charge \nwas dropped when prosecutors apparently decided marijuana found at the scene belonged \nto his companion. Applicant denies having possessed drugs at the time. Therefore, the last \nestablished incident of drug use was about 15 years ago. There is no evidence of either \nsubsequent illegal drug use or abuse or that Applicant maintains any interest in illegal \ndrugs. He denies recent drug abuse and he was favorably examined by the director of a \ncertified alcohol and drug center. Under such facts, DI Mitigating Condition (MC) AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n11 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors noted \nabove. Applicant is a credible and focused man who openly acknowledges his past \nbehavior. In particular, he acknowledges and is remorseful of his past criminal conduct, \ndrug use, and alcohol abuse. With the exception of his two most recent alcohol-related \nincidents, this behavior was exhibited when he was in his 20s and early 30s. The two most \nrecent incidents occurred during a time when he was in transition, enduring a period of \nprotracted unemployment and healing his body\u2019s significant physical ills. Maternal \nintervention set him on the right course, focusing on his physical well-being over the self-\nindulgence of alcohol abuse. Through A.A. and self-motivation, he has quit using alcohol, \nmade related lifestyle modifications, and now seeks to help others with substance \ndependency problems. He lost 150 pounds through surgery and self-discipline, making \nmore lifestyle adaptations where necessary in order to sustain his improved health. He is \nfocused on his health and his work in the specialty of physics. He understands and \nappreciates the detrimental effect stimulants can have on his health. There is no indication \nthat Applicant, who now reflects a level of maturity befitting his age and profession, will \nreturn to criminal activity or substance abuse.  \n \nWhat is troublesome, however, is Applicant\u2019s reluctance to commit his savings and \nmonthly net income toward resolution of his debt. Having found himself abruptly \nunemployed without sufficient cash reserves at an earlier point in his life, he now feels \ncompelled to horde his monetary savings as a form of rainy day cushion in the event he is \ndenied a security clearance and, consequently, loses his job. Applicant is seemingly \nunaware that the rainy day arrived with the SOR. While it is arguable that superior decision-\nmaking might have been demonstrated had Applicant expended all available resources \ntoward the resolution of his debt in the hopes of mitigating financial considerations security \nconcerns, his reluctance to take such a gamble is not entirely irrational.  \n \nTo his credit, the facts mitigate the creation of the delinquent debt. With regard to \ntheir resolution, Applicant has made some tangible progress on the debts at issue. He paid \nfive of the 12 delinquent debts at issue and formally disputed two medical debts, which he \ncredibly believes should have been paid by his health insurer. He attempted to settle, work \nout a repayment plan, or secure a loan to satisfy his three largest debts. He is still \nattempting to seek their resolution despite placing what appears to be a temporary \nmoratorium on expenditures until this process is resolved.   \n \nUnder Guideline F, an unwillingness to pay one\u2019s delinquent debts may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules. There is no evidence that \n\n \n12 \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation reflects a lack of self-control. He lives modestly and is \nmindful of his income. Nor is there any evidence he is presently unwilling to abide by rules, \nlaws, or regulations. Under this guideline and these unique circumstances, questions \nregarding his judgment have less to do with his personal ability to comply with rules and \nregulations and more to do with his ability to live within his means and his willingness to \nmeet his obligations. Here, Applicant has the commitment and sufficient reserve funds to \npay a significant portion, but not all, of his remaining undisputed debt. This is his calculated \napproach to preparing himself for unemployment should he not receive a security \nclearance. Given his past experience, he cannot be blamed for choosing this course, but he \ndoes so at his risk. What he has shown is that he is presently living within his means and is \neager to honor his remaining delinquent debts, albeit at a cautious pace. He demonstrated \nprogress by paying nearly half of his delinquent accounts, genuinely disputing two medical \naccounts, and attempting to resolve his largest debts in an alternative fashion. Such efforts \nshow definite, good-faith progress as well as the willingness to pay his debts that \nunderscore the guideline. Clearance is granted.         \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n13 \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nARTHUR E.

Blank,Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant answered and signed his most recent Security Clearance Application\n(SF 86), on March 10, 2008. On November 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and elected to have his case decided\non the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s\nJune 23, 2009\n\nThe Government submitted ten (10) items in support of its contention.\n1\n2\nwritten case on January 5, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n1\n(FORM) on April 30, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Applicant did\nnot submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 26, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j; 1.l; 1.m; and 1.o of the SOR. He denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.k; 1.n; and 1.p through 1.r of the SOR. He did not provide\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school, and received his undergraduate degree in information technology in June\n2007. He served in the United States Navy from 1982 until 2005. He held a security\nclearance while in the military. He is married and has one child. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since January 2008 (Item 4). \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1992 and his delinquent\ndebts were discharged in March 1993 (Item 5). In August 1995, he filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy and his delinquent debts were discharged in March 1998. Applicant was in\nthe military during this period. In addition, in November 1996, Applicant made an\nunjustified withdrawal on a Government credit card. He was a chief petty office and was\nawarded nonjudicial punishment.\nWhile still in the military in May 2002, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nand his delinquent debts ($50,000) were discharged in August 2002 (Item 6). \nAfter Applicant left the military in 2005, he was employed in a variety of positions.\nHe was unemployed from September 2007 until November 2007. From November 2007\nuntil December 2007, he worked for a building company. Applicant reported that some\nof his current credit problems are due to his 2007 unemployment and the inability to sell\nhis home. He did not elaborate or give any other details (Item 4). \nThe SOR alleges thirteen delinquent debts, including student loans, for a total\namount of approximately $22,433 (Items 9 and 10). Applicant admits owing $6,155 of\nthe listed delinquent debts.\nIn his 2009 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted and listed his\nnumerous collection accounts as noted in the SOR (\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l,\n1.m, 1.o, and 1.q). He has not paid them nor produced any evidence to suggest that he\nhas a plan to do so in the future. He listed one debt \u00b61.o as unknown but there is\n\n3\nnothing to confirm that he has officially disputed the account. This account is listed on\nhis credit report as in collection (Item 9).\nApplicant denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n for $15,420. He submitted\na release of lien dated June 16, 2008 for that account. His most recent credit report\nconfirms that a settlement was accepted on that account (Item 10). His credit report also\nlists numerous other accounts as \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d\nApplicant completed a personal financial statement in August 2008. His total net\nmonthly income is $7,209. After expenses and debt payments, he has a net remainder\nof $1,647. Applicant listed monthly payments to two delinquent accounts listed in the\nSOR. He reported a monthly payment of $245 for a student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.k). He also\nlisted a monthly payment of $50 for a past-due account (SOR \u00b6 1.j). He did not provide\nany documentation to support the payments.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Also, AG \u00b6 19(d), \u201c deceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account\nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional breaches of trust\u201d is\npotentially disqualifying. Applicant has a history of financial problems since 1993. He\naccumulated delinquent debts after filing for bankruptcy on three occasions. He\nadmitted withdrawing money from a Government credit card that was not authorized. He\nhas accumulated more delinquent debt since his last bankruptcy in 2002. His credit\nreports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\n\n5\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant has\ndelinquent debt that has not been resolved. He did not submit any mitigating information\nin response to the FORM. There is no indication that Applicant has any plan to pay\nthese debts in the future. This mitigating condition does not apply in this case. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ I do not find this a factor\nfor consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has resolved one debt. There is nothing in the\nrecord concerning financial counseling. His efforts are not sufficient to carry his burden\nin this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant stated that he did not recognize one\ndebt but he did not provide any documentation to support a dispute concerning the\naccount. I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has failed to provide any\nevidence that the debts are not his responsibility. He has not paid the majority of the\naccounts. He was unemployed in 2007 for two months but his delinquent debts precede\n\n6\nthat time. He has filed for bankruptcy on three occasions. Bankruptcy is a legal means\nto resolve debts but Applicant has acquired more delinquent debt since his last\nbankruptcy filing in 2002. He has an income and a net remainder that would allow him\nto pay on his accounts. He has not met his burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on June 26, 2007. On December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 27, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on February 19, 2009. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on February 20, \n2009.  Applicant received the FORM on March 17, 2009. He had 30 days to submit a \nresponse to the FORM. He did not submit a response. On May 15, 2009, the FORM \nwas forwarded to the hearing office. The FORM was assigned to me on May 18, 2009. \nJune 4, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b \nand 1.d. He denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as an engineer tech with the \ndefense contractor since September 2002. He served in the Army National Guard from \nApril 1995 to March 2005. He is married and has three children and two stepchildren. \n(Item 4)   \n \nOn December 16, 2008, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nbackground investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts:  a $4,750 civil \njudgment that was entered against Applicant on February 1, 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 5, \ncredit report dated September 19, 2008 at 2; Item 6; Item 8 at 4); a $59 satellite  \ntelevision account placed for collection in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 5, credit \nreport dated September 19, 2008, at 7; Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 12); a $7,053 account \nplaced for collection in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 5, credit report, dated September 19, \n2008 at 7); and a $12,918 account owed to the Department of Defense placed for \ncollection in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 5, credit report, dated September 19, 2008, \nat 14-15; Item 7 at 2). \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that he was in the process of \nnegotiating a payment arrangement pertaining to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. At the \nclose of the record, it is unclear whether an agreement was made. He provided proof \nthat the $59 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was settled. (Item 3 at 1) He disputes the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. On January 12, 2009, he entered into a repayment agreement \nrelated to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He agreed to pay $250 a month towards the \ndebt. He provided a bank record that showed a $250 payment was made on January \n23, 2009. He provided no proof of subsequent payments. (Item 3) \n \nIn response to interrogatories dated September 30, 2008, Applicant provided \nproof that he resolved other delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR, but \nwere listed on the credit report obtained during his background investigation. In the \nresponse to interrogatories, he initially disputed the debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, claiming \nthat it was a personal loan that was fraudulently taken out in his name. (Item 5) \nHowever, he admits the debt in his response to the SOR. \n \nThe record does not provide information as to the status of Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial situation.  Applicant did not explain the cause of his financial problems. He did \nnot provide information about his work performance.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. The SOR alleges four delinquent \naccounts, an approximate total of $24,780.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nThree of Applicant\u2019s accounts became delinquent in 2007. Although not alleged in the \nSOR, Applicant had eight other delinquent accounts which were addressed in his \nresponse to interrogatories. Although these accounts were resolved, it is worth \nconsidering these additional delinquent accounts when reviewing the extent of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. Of the four accounts that remain unresolved, Applicant \nresolved the $59 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  Three debts remain unresolved. FC MC \u00b6 \n20 (a) does not apply because Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. \nQuestions remain as to Applicant\u2019s ability to resolve his financial situation.     \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. The record evidence does \nnot indicate the cause of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. I cannot conclude his financial \nproblems were caused by circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I also cannot \nconclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances because he did not \nprovide information regarding his personal financial situation (such as net monthly \nincome, monthly expenses, a budget, etc.)   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling. While he has resolved several of his delinquent accounts prior to the SOR \nbeing issued, three delinquent accounts remain, totaling approximately $24,721. While \nhe entered into a payment agreement with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, he provided \nproof that he only made one payment. I cannot conclude he is timely making payments \nunder the terms of his payment plan without proof of additional payments. It is unlikely \nthat his debts will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. However, he has not provided proof that he has \nbeen making timely payments towards his repayment agreement pertaining to the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.  He has not settled or resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c.  Some credit should be given to Applicant because he resolved several \naccounts that appeared on his credit report during his background investigation, but \nwere not alleged in the SOR. However, a significant amount of unresolved delinquent \ndebts remain.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) potentially applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  Applicant \ndisputes this debt. However, he provided no evidence that he is taking action to formally \ndispute this debt. There is insufficient proof to apply FC MC \u00b620(e).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take steps to resolve his delinquent accounts remains a \nsecurity concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant resolved a lot of \ndebts prior the SOR being issued, he has a significant amount of unresolved delinquent \ndebt.  Insufficient information was provided as to the cause of the financial problems \nand Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. Applicant did not provide enough evidence to \nsupport mitigation of the financial considerations concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
