    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He is not currently married, but he has been with his girlfriend for over 20 years, and they have four children between the ages of 12 and 23. The oldest daughter is not Applicant\u2019s biological daughter, but he claims her as his own child. Since June 1996, he has been employed full time for different defense contractors, with no periods of unemployment. He currently works as a senior systems administrator, and he has held a DOD security clearance since 1996. His annual salary is approximately $82,000. (Tr. 10-11, 22, 37-39, 76; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant has suffered financial problems over a long period of time. He filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2008 when his residence was going into foreclosure. In approximately 2013, he finalized his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Shortly after the bankruptcy was finalized, he suffered financial problems due to being the only source of income for a large family. Additionally, Applicant had to pay taxes in tax year 2015 for the $25,000 his mortgage holder forgave from his mortgage. The 1099 placed him in a higher tax bracket, and he could not pay the taxes he owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 21, 2016, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nG (Alcohol Consumption). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. He admitted all of the SOR allegations, and he attached two \n\n \n2 \n \nreceipts, showing two debts were paid the day before he completed his SOR response. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.) He also attached six letters of recommendation. On February 28, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 22, 2019. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8.  \nApplicant testified, called a witness, and offered 13 documents, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough M into evidence. I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. \nI held the record open for one month in the event either party wanted to submit additional \ndocumentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 5, 2019. On April 24, \n2019, Applicant provided three additional documents, AE N to P, which I entered into \nevidence without objection. The case closed on April 24, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel requested the SOR be amended to \ninclude Paragraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). \nSpecifically, SOR \u00b6 3.a to state: You used Xanax that was not prescribed to you, on at \nleast three occasions to at least 2018, while you held a DOD security clearance. This \nadverse information is in the record, and was also confirmed by Applicant\u2019s testimony. I \ngranted the amendment without objection. (Tr. 69-73, 85-86; GE 2) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He is not \ncurrently married, but he has been with his girlfriend for over 20 years, and they have four \nchildren between the ages of 12 and 23. The oldest daughter is not Applicant\u2019s biological \ndaughter, but he claims her as his own child. Since June 1996, he has been employed \nfull time for different defense contractors, with no periods of unemployment. He currently \nworks as a senior systems administrator, and he has held a DOD security clearance since \n1996. His annual salary is approximately $82,000. (Tr. 10-11, 22, 37-39, 76; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant has suffered financial problems over a long period of time. He filed for a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 2008 when his residence was going into foreclosure. In \napproximately 2013, he finalized his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Shortly after the bankruptcy \nwas finalized, he suffered financial problems due to being the only source of income for \na large family. Additionally, Applicant had to pay taxes in tax year 2015 for the $25,000 \nhis mortgage holder forgave from his mortgage. The 1099 placed him in a higher tax \nbracket, and he could not pay the taxes he owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). \n(Tr. 42-44) \n \n \nIn 2008, Applicant changed his tax withholding status with his employer\u2019s payroll \noffice on the advice of his bankruptcy attorney. After his bankruptcy was finalized in 2013, \nApplicant did not update his tax withholding status, and continued to have insufficient \n\n \n3 \n \ntaxes deducted from his paycheck. This pattern continued for a number of years to at \nleast 2016. He admitted that he always filed his state and Federal tax returns timely, but \nhe was unable to pay the amount of taxes due with his income tax filings. Applicant also \ncashed out his 401K from a previous employer, which contributed to his tax issues. He \nused the money to remodel his house and pay for his daughter\u2019s graduation party. (Tr. \n17, 51-53, 80-81; GE 1, GE 5) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $4,860 for a personal loan he took out in \nabout 2015 to have new floors put into his home. He was to make monthly payments of \nabout $145 for two years with 0% interest. He made one payment and did not make any \nother payments. Applicant contacted the creditor the day before his hearing. He \nrequested a settlement offer and was waiting for settlement documentation. Applicant \nplanned to make payments in the near future to settle this account, and he indicated he \nwould provide documentation within the one-month period the record was to be held \nopen. On April 24, 2019, Applicant provided a copy of a settlement offer from the creditor. \nThe letter dated March 22, 2019, showed that the creditor was willing to accept $2,916.25, \nbut the payment would have to be made by the March 29, 2019, or the settlement offer \nwould be null and void. Applicant failed to provide any documentation showing that he \nsettled this account. This debt has not been resolved.  (Tr. 45-46; GE 2, GE 3, GE 4; AE \nN) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant owes $2,154 for a credit card account charged-\noff as a bad debt. SOR \u00b6 1.i is a duplicate of the same credit card debt that eventually \nresulted in a judgment filed against him in 2018. Applicant provided documentation that \nhe settled this credit card debt after making two $800 payments in late 2018. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and duplicated in \u00b6 1.i, has been settled for less than the full value \nof the alleged debt. (Tr. 46-48; GE 3; AE E) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $927 for a utility account referred for \ncollection. Applicant made a $50 payment on this account a few days before his hearing, \nand he had just recently returned equipment to the creditor. He testified that the creditor \nneeded to recalculate the balance of his account, and he would provide updated \ndocumentation within the one-month period the record was to be held open. On April 24, \n2019, Applicant provided a copy of the creditor\u2019s statement showing that another $50 \npayment was received in April 2019, and $290.27 was credited to the account for the \nreturned equipment. As of the date the record closed, the remaining balance owed to this \ncreditor was $536.28. (Tr. 48-49; GE 3, GE 4; AE G, AE O) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant owes $141 for his car insurance. He provided \ndocumentation with his SOR response showing that he paid this debt. This delinquent \naccount has been resolved. (GE 3, GE 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant owes $102 for a medical account referred for \ncollection. Applicant provided a receipt with his SOR response showing that this account \nwas paid.  This delinquent account has been resolved. (Tr. 49-50; GE 3) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant owes $21,777 in delinquent Federal income taxes \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016. Applicant stated he was in a repayment agreement with the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS), but he fell behind on his monthly payments. He usually \ninitiates a new repayment agreement with the IRS every year after tax season. At some \npoint after the agreement plan is established, he finds he in unable to continue with the \nrepayment plan. Applicant planned to obtain a new payment agreement with the IRS in \nApril 2019. At the hearing, he indicated that he would provide documentation of his past \ntax payment history while the record was held open in his case. Applicant failed to provide \ndocumentation of his payment history with the IRS by the time the record closed. This \nFederal tax debt is outstanding, and is not currently being paid. (Tr. 50-56, 75-76; GE 5) \n \n \nAs of May 2018, the IRS tax transcript for tax year 2015 showed that Applicant \nowed $14,353. His 2016 tax transcript showed that his delinquent tax debt was $7,424.21. \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 tax refund was intercepted and applied to his delinquent accounts owed \nfor tax years 2013, 2014, and the remainder of $1,917 was applied to 2015. (Tr. 75; GE \n5) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant owes $2,466 for a state tax lien entered against \nhim in 2017. Applicant believed the balance should now be around $1,500 since his 2017 \nstate tax refund was intercepted to pay this tax debt. Applicant failed to provide any \ndocumentation by the close of the record to support his claim. The state tax debt is \noutstanding, and the lien has not been released. (Tr. 56; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant owes the city in which he resides approximately \n$9,000 for unpaid real estate taxes for tax years 2008 through 2016. Applicant stopped \npaying his mortgage, which included escrow, when he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. After \nhis bankruptcy was finalized, he did not make any real estate tax payments to the city, \neven though he received delinquent real estate tax notices. He admitted that he had been \non a payment plan at one time, but the payment plan was withdrawn after he did not make \ntimely payments. Applicant did not made any payments on this account for a long period \nof time until the day before his hearing when he made a $50 payment on an account that \nnow totaled $12,000, with accruing interest and penalties. The city tax debt has not been \nresolved. (Tr. 57-58; GE 2; AE I, AE J) \n \n \nApplicant cashed out his unused vacation pay in December 2018 for approximately \n$2,300. He used the money to provide Christmas gifts to his family instead of paying off \ndelinquent debt. Applicant does not have a monthly budget established, he does not have \na savings account, and he has not participated in any financial counseling. He admitted \nthat he still owes about $20,000 for his student loans, but he recently requested a student \nloan forbearance. Applicant also admitted that he does not always pay his utilities in full \neach month, but he has made payment arrangements with his utility creditors to prevent \nhis utilities being shut off. (Tr. 58-64, 76-77, 79-81; AE F) \n \nAlcohol \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2015 for speeding and \noperating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OVI). Applicant admitted that he pled \n\n \n5 \n \nguilty to the OVI charge, and the speeding charge was dismissed. He was arrested while \ndriving to the casino with his poker friends. Applicant was required to attend a three-day \nalcohol awareness course. (Tr. 65-66, GE 1, GE 2, GE 8) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2016 and charged with OVI \nand physical control. Applicant admitted that he was guilty of the physical control charge \nonly. He had been at a bar watching a sporting event and drinking alcohol. He felt fine \nwhen he left the bar. His home was about seven miles away. While driving, Applicant \nrealized that he could be arrested for OVI, so he pulled over and fell asleep in his car. \nThe police arrived and arrested him. He was fined and paid court costs, and placed on \nfive years of community control. (Tr. 66-68; GE 1, GE 2, GE 8) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 2018 for physical control of \nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Applicant admitted that he was initially \ncharged with physical control, but he pled guilty to an amended charge of reckless \noperation. He admitted that he had consumed alcohol and was trying to reconcile with his \ngirlfriend when he was arrested. (Tr. 69-70; GE 8) \n \nMisuse of Prescription Drugs \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s April 2018 arrest, the police found a green pill in his possession. \nIt was determined that the green pill was \u201cXanax.\u201d Since Applicant did not have a \nprescription for the Xanax, he was also charged with possession of a drug (Schedule IV). \nThis charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant admitted that he obtained Xanax \nfrom his friend, and that he had used Xanax without a valid prescription on three or four \noccasions while he possessed a DOD security clearance. Applicant said he obtained the \nprescription drug to help him sleep. He has participated in security briefings over the years \nand he is aware that using a prescription drug without a valid prescription is against DOD \npolicy.  (Tr. 71-74; 85-87; GE 2) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend testified at the hearing. She confirmed Applicant is the sole \nsource of income for the family. She observed his continuing efforts to pay the delinquent \nbills. She does not believe he is dependent on alcohol or illegal drugs. She testified that \nshe is not currently employed, but she is currently searching for employment, and is also \nconsidering going back to school. (Tr. 89-94; AE) \n \n \nApplicant provided four character reference letters at the hearing. One of the \nreferences stated: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, [Applicant] has never broken any laws \nand has always been courteous and kind to co-workers and those in authority.\u201d (AE B) \nNone of the character references mentioned that they were aware of the security issues \nalleged in Applicant\u2019s SOR. All four character references recommended Applicant be \ngranted a top secret security clearance. (AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D) \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n AG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) \u2026failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required.\u201d The evidence of record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nFurther inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts. Applicant has a history of financial and \ntax delinquencies that are not currently resolved. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n\n \n8 \n \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant claimed that his income was \nnot sufficient to cover the financial expenses of raising a large family. He also experienced \nFederal, state, and city tax issues from the unexpected 1099 income attributed to his \n$25,500 mortgage deficiency, and the cash-out of his 401k. Other tax delinquencies \ndeveloped from his failure to update his payroll tax withholding status for several years \nafter his bankruptcy case was closed in 2013. Applicant failed to establish a workable \nbudget for his family and lived beyond his means. He also failed to show any diligence in \nthe responsible handling of his delinquent debts, especially once he finalized his previous \nbankruptcy case and was given a fresh start. He continued to create new debt despite \nbeing employed full time since 1996. Under the current circumstances, there are no clear \nindications that Applicant\u2019s financial and tax issues are being sufficiently resolved or \nunder control. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant did not specifically mention his alcohol-related arrests impact \non his finances, I am certain the combined cost of fines, fees and legal representation \nexpenses have contributed to his financial problems as well. \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 provides for two conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying as follows: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption  of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has three misdemeanor-level alcohol-related offenses in 2015, 2016, \nand 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), 23(c) and 23(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \narrests are recent and demonstrate a pattern of questionable judgment. Other than a \nthree-day alcohol awareness program that was court-ordered in 2015, there is no \nindication that Applicant has received treatment or counseling for his repeated alcohol-\nrelated offenses in 2016 and 2018. Guideline G security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \n  \n \nApplicant used Xanax on three or four occasions without a valid prescription, and \nwhile he possessed a DOD security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) are established.   \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement  \n \n \nApplicant has misused Xanax on more than one occasion, and as recently as April \n2018. He admitted that he participated in annual security training, and was fully aware \nthat the misuse of prescription medication is unacceptable for individuals possessing \nDOD security clearances. The first time Applicant admitted his misuse of a prescription \ndrug to the Government was during cross-examination at his security clearance hearing. \nI find Applicant\u2019s use of Xanax is recent and demonstrates that he is unable to follow rules \nand regulations. His misuse of a prescription drug on three or four occasions while holding \na security clearance shows he is unreliable and untrustworthy. Mitigating conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n\n \n11 \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. He lives with his girlfriend and they have four children, \nages 12, 18, 21 and 23. Since June 1996, he has been employed full time for different \ndefense contractors, with no periods of unemployment. He makes approximately $82,000 \na year. \n \n \nOverall, Applicant has not learned from his mistakes. Since being employed full-\ntime in 1996, he lived beyond his means and created significant debt. He filed a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy in 2008, which was finalized in 2013. Applicant did not change his financial \nbehavior after the bankruptcy was closed, and he did not prepare a workable budget for \nhis family. He continued living beyond his means. When a person repeats their mistakes, \nit is reasonable to expect the development of new debts. Those delinquencies, to include \nsignificant tax debt, are not resolved today.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to learn from his first alcohol-related arrest in 2015. He was \narrested for alcohol-related offenses again in 2016 and 2018. He misused a prescription \ndrug on more than one occasion and as recently as 2018. He used Xanax despite being \naware from his security training that using prescription drugs without a valid prescription \nwas against Federal law and DOD policy. After evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations, \nalcohol consumption, and drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility.

Applicant \ndocumented payment arrangements with this creditor to resolve this debt through $30 \npayments until it is resolved. He provided no proof of payments under this agreement. \n(Item 4; Answer.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant accumulated over $30,000 in delinquent debt. His debts became \ndelinquent between 2016 and 2018. Despite being fully employed since 2016, he has \ninsufficient income to address these liabilities. There is sufficient evidence to establish \ndisqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAll of the debts listed on the SOR became delinquent after Applicant was fully \nemployed in his current position. Applicant did not establish a nexus between the \nunemployment and underemployment he experienced prior to 2016 and his inability to \nresolve these debts as they became due in 2016 through 2018. Further, his debts were \nincurred at least two years after the child-support garnishment began. Applicant failed to \nmeet his burden to show that these were circumstances beyond his control. Additionally, \nApplicant provided no evidence of adjusting his budget or lifestyle to live within his means. \nThere is no evidence that he will be able to avoid delinquent accounts in the future.  \n \n \nThe record lacks documentation to show he reasonably and responsibly \naddressed his delinquencies in a timely manner. Applicant provided no documentation of \nfinancial counseling. He is credited with resolving SOR \u00b6 1.b. He has payment \nagreements with all of this remaining creditors and has documented a payment or two, \nmade to all but one creditor under those agreements. This is a good first step, but without \n\n \n6 \n \n \na more substantial track record of payments, he failed to establish a good-faith effort to \nresolve his debts. His debt is ongoing. The above mitigating conditions are not fully \nestablished.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \nmilitary service and his recent efforts to make payment arrangements to resolve his \ndelinquencies with his limited income. However, he failed to support his statements with \nproof of concomitant action and a developed track record of repayment. He may be \neligible for national security eligibility in the future if he is able to document reasonable \nand responsible actions to maintain solvency. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on December 4, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on \nDecember 12, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM  and identified \n\n2 \n \nas Items 1 through 6, is admitted without objection. Applicant responded to the FORM \nwith a packet of documents, which was marked as Item A, and admitted into the record \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2019. Based on my review \nof the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has  mitigated the financial concerns. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee for a federal contractor. She is separated from \nher husband who she married in 2011, and she has two adult children. (Item 2) She \nobtained her general education degree (GED) in 1990. She obtained an undergraduate \ndegree in 2010. She has never held a security clearance. She has been employed with \nher current employer since June 2017. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.m, 13 delinquent accounts including student loans \ntotaling $53,781, medical collection or charged-off accounts, and consumer accounts for \na grand total of approximately $60,382. (Item 1) Applicant admitted  debts listed on the \nSOR with the exception of 1.k-1.m, and provided explanations. She also denied one \naccount (1.f) that had been paid, and the Government withdrew the allegation.  (Items 1, \n2) Her credit reports confirm the remaining delinquent debts. (Items 5, 6) \n \n \nApplicant attributes her delinquent debts to  her husband who is now incarcerated \nand his inability to work due to mental illness. She also was unemployed from May 2016 \nto June 2017, approximately 13 months. (Item 4) In addition she had a child who required \nsurgery. She and her husband have been separated and she has a two-year protective \norder in place that forbids any contact other than from attorney to attorney. Applicant \nplans to divorce him.  With her response to FORM, she included a Marital Separation and \nProperty Agreement. This court document requires Applicant\u2019s husband to pay three \nmedical debts which were the result of injuries Applicant sustained from her husband\u2019s \nviolent behavior.  (AE A) \n \n \nApplicant explained that she purchased a home in 2008, but the property was in \nher name only. Her husband disappeared frequently and did not contribute to home or \nliving  expenses. She managed to stay current with the mortgage after some difficulty. He \nalso assaulted Applicant  and was often violent.  Applicant stressed that he also incurred \nbills that he did not pay, and Applicant was left with the accounts including medical and a \ncell phone account. Applicant submitted a social security statement that shows that her \nhusband has not had any income for the majority of his life. (Item 2)   \n \n \nAs to SOR allegations 1.a to 1.e, and 1.g,( student loans), Applicant stated that \nshe had some student loans under NELNET that are in good standing. She submitted \ndocumentation with her response to FORM that a forebearance ended in March 2019; \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (Item 3) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n3 \n \nand the six student loans are now  rehabilitated; and she is not past due on any balance. \nShe submitted receipts from November, December, and January. She submitted her \npayment of $289.38, which is her new monthly payment on the consolidated student \nloans. (AE A) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.h., Applicant provided documentation that she researched the \naccount and has paid the phone account. (AE A). Applicant made two payments  of \n$405.52. The account is satisified in full. Her husband was responsible for the charges, \nand the property agreement provides that he reimburse her for  her payments to address \nthe phone amount. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, three medical accounts totaling approximately $2,200, \nApplicant  paid $300 to date. The medical bills are for the hospitalization that occurred \nwhen her husband dislocated her finger. He is to pay the medical debts according to the \nproperty separation agreement, but she had decided to make payments as she doubts \nthat he will. She provided documentation of her payments. (AE A) As to 1.k,  she disputed \nthe account, and it has been removed from her credit report. She provided documentation \nthat she paid the account in 1.l for lab work. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.m, Applicant disputed the account in the amount of $2,911, as it is \nher husband\u2019s account. However, despite the fact that he is to pay according to the marital \nproperty agreement, she has set up a payment arrangement of $55 a month automatically \ndeducted from her account. She provided a receipt and documentation to prove her claim. \n(AE  A) \n \n \nDuring her investigative interview in 2017, Applicant  candidly stated that she was \nbehind on her mortgage payments due to unemployment and surgery. She also spoke of \nher payment plan for state taxes. However, she is now current with her mortgage. She \nhas paid non-SOR debts as reflected in her response to FORM. She had no problems \nwhen she was working in a prior job for 12 years. Applicant went to school after work to \nimprove her job opportunities. She used money from her 401(k) to help pay bills. Her \nmarriage in 2011 created financial hardship. She stated that she had paid several of her \nhusband\u2019s debts. Since the assault, he is in jail. She has a protective order. She \naddressed her student loans and the medical debts, which  were in forebearance until \nMarch 2019. (Item 4) \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n4 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, and failure to pay her \ndelinquent debts or set up any payment plans raises two disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n6 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of  the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the debt. \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation that her student loans are consolidated and she \nis making timely payments. Her other delinquent debts have been satisified or disputed.  \nShe was unemployed for a year after having surgery. Her soon to be ex-husband \nassaulted her and caused the injuries which led to the medical debts. He contributed \nnothing to the home or living expenses. She submitted specific information about \npayments she has made. She provided a marital property settlement agreement. \nApplicant has furnished sufficient information to meet her burden. She is divorcing her \nhusband who caused many of the financial problems. The five listed  mitigating conditions \napply. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant is separated from an abusive husband. He assaulted her and she \nsuffered injuries from the assault which resulted in hospitalization. She has a protective \norder in place. He is now in jail. She was unemployed for one year. Circumstances beyond \nher control adversely affected her finances, and she acted reasonably and responsibly to \naddress her delinquent debts. She took action and addressed her student loans and the \nother accounts.    \n\n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline D, sexual behavior, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \n \n\n2 \n \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn June 18, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July 24, 2018, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6). DOHA forwarded a copy \nof the FORM to Applicant on July 26, 2018, and instructed him to respond within 45 days of \nreceipt. Applicant received the FORM on August 8, 2018, and he submitted a timely \nresponse that was accepted without any objections by the Government on September 14, \n2018. On November 30, 2018, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I received the case assignment on December 3, 2018, and accepted Applicant\u2019s \nFORM response in the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 a June 10, 2014, report of a lifestyle \npolygraph interview conducted by another government agency, and as Item 6 a summary \nreport of subject interviews of Applicant conducted for his current background investigation \non July 5, 2017, on July 10, 2017, and September 5, 2017. The summary report was part \nof the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In a footnote, the FORM \nadvised Applicant of the following: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 3) [sic] is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that \n\n3 \n \nthe report is unauthenticated by a Government witness and the document \nmay not be considered as evidence. If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \n  \n  \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. He did not file any objections to the interview \nreport in his rebuttal (AE A) to the FORM. Instead, he stated that the summary of the \ninterview included as Item 6 is an accurate representation of the information he provided to \nthe OPM investigator. Accordingly, I accepted Item 6 in evidence, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \n \nIn his rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant objected instead to the report of his polygraph \ninterview (Item 4) as a summary of his statements from the perspective of the investigator \nlacking the context of the questions and any quoted statements by him. Applicant \ncontended that the interviewer \u201ctook advantage of apparent guilt fed by Applicant, based \non his personal moral code grounded in his professed religion;\u201d a guilt not grounded in \nillegal activities but in having viewed any pornography. Mindful that Government officials \nare entitled to a presumption of regularity in the discharge of their official responsibilities,1 I \nreviewed the report, but considered Applicant\u2019s concerns in determining the weight to be \nafforded the information in light of the evidence as a whole. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline D (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and cross-alleges under Guideline \nE (SOR \u00b6 2.a),2 that Applicant deliberately sought out and viewed sexually explicit photos \nof underage females on various occasions between at least 2012 and June 2014. (Item 1.) \nIn his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant denied the conduct alleged. He indicated that \nthe allegation is \u201ca gross misrepresentation of information considered to be a discovery by \na polygraph interviewer,\u201d who conducted \u201can extensive intrusion\u201d lasting upwards of four \n                                                 \n1 See e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \n \n2 SOR \u00b6 2.a alleged \u201cInformation as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.q., above.\u201d There are no \nallegations 1.b through 1.q in the SOR of record.  \n\n4 \n \nhours where any response by him indicating inadvertent or potential engagement was \ninterpreted as if there had been criminal activity. \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), \nand AE A, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old computer software engineer. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin computer science awarded in December 2011 and a master\u2019s degree in computer \ninformation science awarded in May 2014. (Item 5.) He has worked for his current \nemployer, a large defense contractor, since November 2014. He has been married since \nApril 2014, and he and his spouse have a two-year-old son. (Item 3.) \n \nWhile in college, Applicant ignored known university policies regarding computer use \nseveral times. In November 2007 or 2008, he ran a penetration test with a hacking tool and \nby scanning the university\u2019s unblocked network traffic, was able to log onto another \nstudent\u2019s laptop and steal his passwords. A friend had bet him that it could not be done, \nand Applicant wanted to show him otherwise. The university disabled his student account \nfor one semester, but Applicant got around it by using two or three other students\u2019 \ncredentials to gain Internet access. While taking a technical writing course in the summer \nof 2011, Applicant asked the computer science department if he could perform a blanket \nsweep of the network to scan for security certificates and cookie certificates. After being \ndenied authorization, he used his personal computer to \u201cattack\u201d 10 to 12 student accounts, \nalthough he did not steal or save any information from their accounts. Between 2007 and \n2011, Applicant streamed movies knowing that they had been illegally downloaded by a \nfriend. Applicant illegally downloaded computer games from various sites, and after \nobtaining computer software programs for trial, he used a software tool that removed the \nlicense features. (Items 4, 6.) \n \nApplicant worked as a graduate research assistant during academic semesters from \nJanuary 2012 through May 2014 while pursuing his master\u2019s degree. From June 30, 2013, \nto March 8, 2014, he was an intern with another government agency. An information \nsecurity specialist familiar with Applicant\u2019s work indicated in June 2014 that Applicant was \nhighly skilled in computer-related issues. (Item 5.) \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant completed a security clearance application for a top secret \nclearance and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access eligibility in conjunction \nwith his application for a sensitive position with the U.S. Government. During a polygraph \npre-test interview conducted on June 10, 2014, Applicant acknowledged his misuse of \ncomputer information systems in college and his illegal downloading, streaming, or \nretention of audio books, music, computer games, movies, and software programs. He \ndenied any future intent to continue downloading material protected by copyright except for \nbooks.3 \n                                                 \n3 The SOR does not allege any misuse of a computer information system, so his past activities cannot be \nconsidered in disqualification. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows: \n \n\n5 \n \n \nWhen asked about Internet content concerns, Applicant reportedly volunteered that \nhe frequented two nudist-colony websites once or twice a week from 2012 to 2013 and \nthen with somewhat lesser frequency, about four times a month to present (June 2014); \nthat on those websites he viewed photos of naked children under the age of 18; and that in \n2013, he was redirected to a different website that contained underage pornographic \nimages and he viewed two sexually-explicit images involving females that were around age \neight or nine. Applicant reportedly indicated that he became sexually aroused when viewing \nnude photos of children and sometimes masturbated. On one of the websites, he \nreportedly viewed a beauty pageant that included females of ages 16 to 22. Applicant also \nindicated that he accessed through Google a website containing erotic stories, and that he \nread stories about minors at least 50 percent of the time. He also reportedly conducted \nGoogle searches using the keywords \u201cyoung nudist\u201d and \u201cteenage sex.\u201d Applicant is \nreported to have said that he has a problem in that he wants to view pornography and to \nhave expressed his belief that he would continue to access the nudist colony websites and \nread exotic stories. While he indicated that his spouse was aware of the exotic stories, no \none knew about his pornography viewing. (Item 4.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s background investigator disclosed no issues of concern from former and \npresent professors, co-workers, and friends. They indicated that Applicant was professional \nand focused in his information technology work, honest and trustworthy, and involved in \nclass and religious activities. He lived within his means and had no financial issues. (Item \n5.) In August 2014, Applicant he was notified that he was no longer being offered a position \nwith the Government. (Item 6.) \n \nIn November 2014, Applicant began working for his current employer. He started \ncompleting clearance paperwork in March 2015, but due to a mix-up, he had to complete a \nnew Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in August 2016. On August 9, \n2016, he submitted an SF 86 on which he disclosed that he had illegally or without proper \nauthorization accessed or attempted to access an information technology system in the last \nseven years. He indicated that he had \u201cside-jacked\u201d the personal accounts of others on the \nsame wireless network at school \u201cas proof of concept for a paper\u201d without obtaining \nauthorization, but that no action was taken against him. He also disclosed that there were \nsome minor instances of software piracy by him in the last seven years, and that he made \nsome modifications to gaming software. (Item 3.) \n \nOn July 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). About his previously disclosed side-jacking of \nclassmate accounts for a research paper, Applicant indicated that he had the permission of \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s hacking or \u201cside-jacking\u201d experience is particularly relevant in assessing his credibility \nwith regard to whether his viewing of child pornography was inadvertent or intentional.  \n\n6 \n \nthe students but not of the university\u2019s information systems department. He acknowledged \nthat he had engaged in software piracy between 2005 and possibly 2012, but he indicated \nno recurrence since his marriage in 2014. He explained that he could not afford to \npurchase the media at the time, and he did not see his conduct as wrong. After being \nconfronted with his hacking of another student\u2019s login credentials, Applicant admitted that \nhe and a friend successfully hacked the account of another student who told him it could \nnot be done. Applicant\u2019s motivation in all cases was to see if he could do it. While in high \nschool, he had hacked into a teacher\u2019s computer and obtained tests, and he hacked into \nthe computer system in another incident and changed the results of his examinations in an \nadvanced placement class. (Item 6.) \n \nWhen asked about his Internet access to pornographic images of children twice in \n2012, Applicant explained that he was not looking for pornography but instead was doing \ncyber research into new hacks as a hobby. In lieu of the searched-for tutorial for hacking \ntechniques, the pictures \u201cpopped up.\u201d4 Applicant acknowledged that he had viewed other \ntypes of pornography that is legal, but he ceased that behavior shortly after his marriage. \nApplicant could not explain the reported polygraph interview statements that he became \naroused when thinking of the innocence of children. He indicated that he had been asked \nso many questions, and he was embarrassed at the time because he had not told his \nspouse. He maintained that he told his spouse about the pornographic images after his \npolygraph. (Item 6.) \n \nOn July 10, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator. About \nwhether his viewing of child pornography could cause him problems with his spouse, \nfamily, employment, or legal authorities, Applicant responded that the incident was \nembarrassing but that he would talk about it. (Item 6.) \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied that he intentionally sought out or viewed \nchild pornography, and stated, in part: \n \nThe [polygraph] interviewer had misconstrued my apparent discomfort based \non my distaste for the topic in general and initiated a line of questioning over \nan extended period of time to reword questions which had seemed designed \nto coerce responses, that when answered in the affirmative, would imply \nengagement in related behaviors. It had seemed that any response which \nhad indicated inadvertent or potential engagement prompted interrogation \nand interpretation as if there had been criminal activity. \n \nApplicant denied that any of the behaviors \u201cactually discussed\u201d in the polygraph \ninterview were habitual in nature or that he would be prone to blackmail because the \nincidents were known to his wife, some close friends, and a couple of co-workers. He \nadded that nothing \u201cresembling the original incident\u201d has recurred since he encountered \nthe material accidentally. Applicant indicated that after he was advised of the allegations in \nthe more recent clearance process, he was interviewed by an agent from the Federal \n                                                 \n4 He now claims that he \u201cmisremembered\u201d the website containing the sexually-explicit images during his \nOPM interview. (AE A.) \n\n7 \n \nBureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, who \u201cbelieved there to have been a significant \nmisrepresentation of events from the polygraph.\u201d5 Applicant expressed a willingness to \nundergo a psychological assessment to \u201csubstantiate [his] assertions that the allegations \nare a product of exaggeration and misinterpretation and that there is no risk of any \ndeliberate occurrence of the alleged behavior.\u201d (Item 2.) \n \nApplicant was provided a copy of the polygraph report in the FORM. In rebuttal (AE \nA), he indicated that \u201cvital information had been excised from the official record to construct \na misleading narrative indicating the inaccurate conclusions aligning with the accusations \nthat [he] contests.\u201d He indicated that the interviewer asked shocking questions, and spent \nhours on the issue in an attempt to elicit a single positive response. While disputing the \naccuracy of the polygraph report, Applicant did not deny that he had visited the three \nwebsites named in the report, but he asserted that one website contained legal erotic \nstories, and the other two websites \u201ccontained legal depictions of nudism, defined as non-\nsexually explicit nude images.\u201d Applicant asserted that the interviewer took advantage of \nthe guilt that he felt in having viewed any pornography because of his \u201cpersonal moral code \ngrounded in his professed religion.\u201d Because of his \u201cself-induced emotional state,\u201d he felt \nmanipulated by the investigator, who pressured him for details. Being as candid as \npossible, he informed the interviewer of an incident in which he believed he may have \ninadvertently encountered illegal sexually explicit images. Concerning his specific \nresponses, Applicant claims that he interpreted the questions as pertaining to the websites \ngenerally and not with regard to illegal contraband. He never intended to characterize his \nexposure to illegal material as frequent or of interest to him. \n \nIn an attempt to reconstruct the polygraph interviewer\u2019s inquiries, Applicant \nacknowledged the following admissions made during his polygraph interview: \n \n\uf0b7 He viewed pornography or images containing nude persons approximately once to \ntwice a week from 2012 to 2013 and once a week to June 2014. \n \n\uf0b7 He viewed images on nudist websites, which was becoming a habit that he felt was \nmorally reprehensible. \n \n\uf0b7 He became sexually aroused by an image and masturbated to ejaculation while \nviewing the image, although he later indicated that he acted on reading a fictional \nerotic story. \n \n\uf0b7 He viewed images of families on nudist webpages with the ages of family members \nranging from infancy to elderly. \n \n\uf0b7 He viewed images of people representing themselves as underage but not \nintentionally. \n                                                 \n5 There is no report of an interview with an FBI investigator in the record. Applicant may have been referring to \nhis interview with the OPM investigator, although in his rebuttal to the FORM (AE A), Applicant expressed his \nunderstanding that his July 2017 interviewers were with an OPM investigator, and he indicated that there was \nan external FBI investigation.  \n\n8 \n \n\uf0b7 He clicked on a category expected to contain teenage images but he was unsure of \nthe actual age of the females pictured. \n \n\uf0b7 He viewed websites containing questionably-related materials, i.e., the three named \nwebsites during his polygraph interview. About the three websites, Applicant \nindicated that he was asked very explicit questions that were \u201cshocking and \nuncomfortable enough to find themselves excluded\u201d from the report, and that he \nanswered affirmatively \u201cunder the mistaken assumption that any actions should be \ninitially construed in the most stark and worst degree and that questions intended to \nprovide context and mollify any initial responses would be forthcoming.\u201d He denied \nthat the statements made in the short discussions were intended to imply a habit or \nintentional engagement with illegal material. \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 While in the photo gallery of one of the two nudist websites in 2013, he viewed a \npicture from the teenage category that redirected him to a different website where \nhe looked at a pornographic image of a female around age eight or nine for about \nfive seconds. After he closed that image, an image popped up of a female of similar \nage being sexually penetrated by an older male. He found it shocking and viewed it \nfor only a few seconds. \n\uf0b7 As of his polygraph interview in June 2014, he was hiding his involvement with \npornography from everyone. \n \nApplicant added that some of his responses to the inquiries of the polygraph \ninterviewer may have been made \u201cto please and perhaps impress the interviewer with stark \nand candid responses to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate to the greatest degree \npossible.\u201d Applicant denied any inference that he had a habit of viewing illegal \npornography. Because he considered all forms of pornography to be morally problematic, \nhe reduced the frequency of viewing overtime and eventually switched from images to text-\nbased stories. Applicant submitted that his conduct was morally questionable by his own \nstandards but not illegal, and that his inadvertent encounters with child pornography had \nbeen fully mitigated by revealing the information to his wife, to some co-workers, and to \nfriends, including a couple of gaming friends whom he had net met in person. While \nacknowledging that he had previously felt guilty at having viewed pornography or nudist \nmaterial, he asserted that those behaviors \u201cnow serve as a means by which [he] can \nempathize with others who experience the same forms of guilt about falling short on self-\nimposed morality.\u201d He submitted that his sexual behaviors were \u201cstrictly private and \ndiscrete.\u201d As evidence of his candor, Applicant cited his self-admitted questionable uses of \ncomputing resources \u201cto show off and generate some measure of pride among peers about \nhis talents with computing devices. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \n\n9 \n \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are articulated in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified for sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \n\n10 \n \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n  \n \nThe report of Applicant\u2019s June 2014 polygraph interview reflects frequent access by \nApplicant from 2012 \u201cto present\u201d (i.e., June 2014) of nudist websites where he viewed nude \nimages of persons of all ages, including females that clearly appeared to be underage \nbecause of their physical development or were represented as being underage. Applicant \nis reported to have admitted viewing a photo gallery of teenagers on one of the nudist \nwebsites and becoming sexually aroused by the images. Regarding the other nudist-colony \nwebsite, he viewed a naked beauty pageant that included females represented to be 16 to \n22 years old. He is also reported to have conducted Google searches using the keywords \n\u201cyoung nudist\u201d and \u201cteenage sex,\u201d although he indicated that the images accessed did not \nconstitute child pornography because they were accompanied with a warning from Google \nabout the illegality of underage pornographic material. \n \n \nApplicant submits that the interviewer constructed a misleading narrative from his \nresponses to make it appear that he intentionally sought out sexually-explicit photographs \nof underage females. He contends that the interviewer took advantage of his emotional \ndistress in having viewed pornography and nudist material against his moral code and \nreligious beliefs. However, Applicant also indicated in rebuttal that he attempted to \u201cplease \nand perhaps impress the interviewer with stark and candid responses.\u201d \n \n \nGovernment officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in good faith in the \ndischarge of their official responsibilities. See ISCR 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \nWhile the circumstances of a polygraph interview can be somewhat stressful, there is no \nevidence that the polygraph interviewer deliberately misrepresented what Applicant told \nhim. Applicant does not dispute that he accessed websites containing pornographic images \nand that he became sexually aroused, although primarily when reading erotic stories \nonline. Access to adult pornography may be viewed as morally repugnant by some, but the \nDOD is not in the position of passing judgment on such activities unless they are shown to \nbe illegal or contrary to policy (e.g., using a government-issued computer, access during \nduty hours, in circumstances showing a lack of discretion), or present an unacceptable risk \nof exploitation, pressure, or duress. In that regard, Applicant detailed two instances where \nhe observed underage females in sexually-explicit acts or poses. His claim that the access \nwas completely accidental is of suspect credibility, given his knowledge of computer \nsystems in general (he proved to be a successful hacker in college) and other admissions \nduring his polygraph interview that he had conducted Internet searches for \u201cteenage sex\u201d \nand having viewed images of underage females on nudist websites. With regard to his \naccess to pornographic images involving underage females, he acknowledged in June \n2014 that no one was aware that he had viewed any pornographic images. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual \nhas been prosecuted,\u201d AG \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and AG \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a \npublic nature or that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d apply to a greater or lesser \n\n11 \n \nextent. The evidence of his access to sexually-explicit child pornography is limited,6  but he \nalso hid it from his family and friends. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his judgment \nraised by his sexual behavior and his concealment of that sexual behavior. Two mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 14 could apply in this case.7 They are: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \n \nApplication of the aforesaid mitigating conditions depends on whether Applicant is to \nbe believed when he asserts that there has been no recurrence since the instances that \noccurred in 2012, and that he has informed his spouse, friends, and some co-workers \nabout his access to child pornography. Applicant presented no statements from his spouse \nor others who could corroborate that they know about his viewing of pornography or erotic \nstories involving minors. His credibility suffers to the extent that he provided discrepant \naccounts of the circumstances involving his access to child pornography. During his OPM \ninterview in July 2017, he claimed that he was doing cyber research into new hacks \u201cas a \nhobby of learning and the pictures were there.\u201d In June 2014, he named the nudist website \n(which he regularly viewed and had intentionally accessed to view a picture from the \nteenage category) that redirected him to the website where he viewed the sexually-explicit \nimages involving children. He now claims that he \u201cmisremembered\u201d the website containing \nthe sexually-explicit images during his OPM interview. While the passage of time could \ndiminish his recollection, he did not explain how child pornography would have \u201cpopped up\u201d \non a website for a computer-hacking tutorial. \n \n Applicant\u2019s efforts to discredit the polygraph report with claims that the interviewer \ntook advantage of his emotional distress, asked shocking questions, and spent hours on \nthe issue in an attempt to elicit a single positive response, do not indicate reform. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he answered the polygraph interviewer\u2019s questions in the \naffirmative under the mistaken assumption that any action should be construed in the most \nstark and worst degree possible is contradicted by his assertion that he gave stark but also \ncandid responses to demonstrate his willingness to cooperate. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to overcome the sexual behavior security concerns. \n                                                 \n6 Regarding the knowing access of child pornography with intent to view, which is punishable under 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2252A, it is an affirmative defense if the alleged child pornography was produced using no minors or if the \nperson had less than three images of child pornography, and promptly and in good faith took reasonable steps \nto destroy the image or reported the matter to a law enforcement agency and afforded the agency access to \nthe image. \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s case for applicability of AG \u00b6 14(d), \u201cthe sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscrete,\u201d ignores the fact that child pornography is not consensual, even if he accessed the pornographic \nimages in the privacy of his own home. \n\n12 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior, as detailed under Guideline D, raises considerable \nconcerns about his judgment generally under AG \u00b6 15 and is the type of conduct \ncontemplated within disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e), which provides: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \nSimilar to AG \u00b6 14(b) under Guideline D, the personal conduct guideline also \nprovides for mitigation when the offense was so infrequent or occurred so long ago to no \nlonger be of security concern. AG \u00b6 17(c) provides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nFor the reasons addressed under Guideline D, concerns also persist about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness under Guideline E. He has yet to \npersuade me that his poor judgment in accessing child pornography is not likely to recur or \nthat it is no longer a source of vulnerability for him. Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertion \nthat his spouse, friends, and some co-workers are aware of his sexual behavior falls short \nof establishing AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d The record contains no information \nabout what they know, if anything, about his access to illegal sexually-explicit images. \n \nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d is largely without merit. The \ninformation of security concern was provided by Applicant, who admitted to the polygraph \ninterviewer that he had access to sexually-explicit images of children, and that he had \nconducted Internet searches using the term \u201cteenage sex.\u201d Without the opportunity to \nobserve Applicant\u2019s demeanor and question him about his access to pornography, it is \n\n13 \n \nparticularly difficult to find that his access to child pornography was inadvertent. The \npersonal conduct security concerns are not adequately mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analyses under Guidelines D and E are incorporated in \nmy whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant detailed a pattern of access to pornography that appears to have been \nlegal for the most part. However, he accessed sexually-explicit images of underage \nfemales at least twice and conducted Internet searches using the term \u201cteenage sex.\u201d \nApplicant may well have been \u201cshocked\u201d by what he saw, but it is also difficult to believe \nthat his access to child pornography was inadvertent. He was a frequent viewer of websites \nwhere he sought out images of nude teenage females for sexual arousal. He has \nconsiderable computer knowledge and skills and knew, or should have known, to avoid \nquestionable websites and links where he risked access to illegal pornography. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted above, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n14 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

In 2013, he earned several certifications and two associate\u2019s degrees in computer information technology and security. He has never married, and he is a father of a 10-year-old daughter. He received full custody of his daughter when she was entering first grade, which occurred shortly after her mother passed away. Applicant was on Social Security disability from about 2002 to 2010. His parents applied for his disability in 2002 when Applicant was hospitalized a second time for mental health issues. He was hired by a DOD contractor in March 2015.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n05/28/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent psychological evaluation indicated that his present \nmental status negatively impacts his judgment and trustworthiness. In addition, he did \nnot show diligence, or even a good-faith effort, in the handling of his financial issues. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the psychological conditions and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn March 23, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn September 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions), and Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 19, 2018. He denied all of the SOR \nallegations, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On February 28, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 20, 2019.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4, \nand I admitted GE 1, GE 3, and GE 4 into evidence without objection. Applicant \nobjected to GE 2, which is a 2017 evaluation report from a licensed psychologist hired \nby DOD. Applicant provided four character reference letters labeled as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A-D, which I admitted into evidence without objection. I held the record \nopen until April 20, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional \ndocumentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 1, 2019. No \nadditional documents were provided, and the record was closed on April 20, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant objected to GE 2, which is his 2017 psychological \nevaluation report from a licensed psychologist hired by DOD. The report reflected an \nundesirable conclusion for Applicant.  Applicant requested I take into consideration that \nat the time of his evaluation, he was under the influence of prescribed medication for his \nback injury. He did not specify what particular information reported in the evaluation was \ninaccurate, or what information he provided to the licensed psychologist concerned him. \nHe told the licensed psychologist at the time of his evaluation of the specific medication \nhe was taking, however, the psychologist was not concerned and continued the \nevaluation. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection since his psychological evaluation is \nrelevant to the facts of this case. I advised him that I would take into account that he \nwas taking prescribed medication when I reviewed the report. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: Applicant is 35 years old. In 2013, he earned several certifications and \ntwo associate\u2019s degrees in computer information technology and security. He has never \nmarried, and he is a father of a 10-year-old daughter. He received full custody of his \ndaughter when she was entering first grade, which occurred shortly after her mother \npassed away. Applicant was on Social Security disability from about 2002 to 2010. His \nparents applied for his disability in 2002 when Applicant was hospitalized a second time \nfor mental health issues. He was hired by a DOD contractor in March 2015. Applicant is \na field services technician, and he makes approximately $46,000 annually. He does not \ncurrently possess a DOD security clearance, but his employer is sponsoring him for a \nsecurity clearance in order for him to perform specific employment duties. (Tr. 15-17, \n30, 33-35, 38-39; GE 1)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant was hospitalized in 1999, and again in \n2002, due to suicide ideation and manic behavior. Applicant denied these allegations. In \nhis response to the SOR. He admitted that he was hospitalized, but stated that this \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninformation should not be used against him in consideration of his security clearance \neligibility. He was forced into the hospital against his will by his parents who, although \nmeaning well, were severely misguided in their actions. This caused him to suffer \nextreme emotional distress. (Tr. 35) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that in 2006, Applicant was treated for Bipolar Disorder, \nGeneral Anxiety Disorder, and Severe Psychotic tendencies. In 2008, he discontinued \nmental health treatment and stopped taking his prescribed medications. Applicant \ndenied this allegation in his response to the SOR. He stated the diagnosis was a \ncontinuation of the original misguided diagnosis made in 1997, which was based on \nexaggerated input by his parents to medical personnel. He claimed the prescribed \nmedications administered to him caused most of the issues addressed during his \nbackground investigation. (Tr. 25, 35) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that in 2010, Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, \nGeneral Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Alcohol Dependence, Cannabis Dependence, \nand Polysubstance Dependence. Applicant\u2019s prognosis was poor after he discontinued \ntreatment. Applicant denied this allegation in his response to the SOR. He stated that he \nwas in extreme emotional distress following the death of his father, and his fianc\u00e9e of \nfive years left him and took his daughter with her. He claimed the diagnosing agency did \nnot perform a new evaluation, but only continued his original diagnosis from 1997. The \nmedical facility and staff also had financial reasons to keep him in treatment. Applicant \ndid not recall his use of marijuana in 2010, and that is the reason he did not disclose it \non his 2015 SCA. (Tr. 26-28) \n \nThe last allegation under Guideline I, (SOR \u00b6 1.e), alleges in December 2017, \nApplicant was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed, in \npartial remission, Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, in remission, Cannabis Use Disorder, \nMild, and Social Anxiety Disorder (with associated panic attacks). In the opinion of the \nduly qualified mental health professional, Applicant\u2019s present mental status and \ninterpersonal style appeared to negatively impact his judgment and trustworthiness. \nApplicant denied this allegation in his response to the SOR. He claimed the licensed \npsychologist hired by DOD was not impartial and simply reconfirmed the original \ndiagnosis based on a brief interview. Applicant noted at the time of the evaluation, he \nwas awaiting back surgery and was under the influence of prescribed medications. \nFinally, he claimed the psychologist was offended by Applicant\u2019s distrust of all mental \nhealth professionals, and especially after Applicant discounted the value of the field of \npsychology since it is purely based on opinion. (Tr. 24, 30-33) \n \nThe 2017 psychological evaluation was requested by the DOD CAF after \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed he was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, \nGeneral Anxiety Disorder, and Severe Psychotic tendencies. In addition, there was also \nevidence of cannabis and alcohol abuse. The DOD CAF requested Applicant participate \nin a psychological exam. Applicant complied with the request and he was evaluated in \nAugust 2017. Applicant told the licensed psychologist that he was in treatment \nbeginning around the age of eight. Since 2011, he stopped taking all of his prescribed \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmedications and has not received any additional mental health treatment. He reported \nthat as a child, he did not get along with his parents, who were strict practitioners of the \nMormon faith. Due to his rebellion, his parents thought he had mental health issues, and \nhe was prescribed numerous medications. Applicant admitted that he recently \nexperienced a panic attack in advance of the present evaluation. His panic attacks are \nalmost always related to a stressful event in his life. (Tr. 32; GE 2) \n \nIn 2002, when Applicant was 19 years old, he was hospitalized multiple times \ndue to suicide ideation and manic behaviors. He reported to the psychologist that the \nprimary reason for treatment in 2002 involved his use of alcohol. Applicant moved away \nfrom his parents, and in 2006, at the age of 23, he voluntarily sought mental health \ntreatment. The records indicate that he was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, General \nAnxiety Disorder, and Severe Psychotic tendencies. He soon stopped all medication \nand counseling, and sought \u201calternative treatments\u201d instead of taking prescribed \nmedications. Nevertheless, Applicant sought mental health care again in 2010, at the \nage of 27. He was contemplating suicide and had a plan to potentially use a knife to \ncommit suicide. The 2010 treatment records showed that he was diagnosed with Bipolar \nDisorder, Psychotic Disorder NOS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, \nAlcohol Dependence, Cannabis Dependence, and Polysubstance Dependence. He was \nprescribed Lexapro, Depakote, Klonopin, and Zyprexa. Additionally, a history of \nparanoia, visual hallucinations, and delusional and disorganized thinking was noted in \nhis treatment records. (GE 2) \n \nThe psychologist noted that Applicant was evasive in reporting his past use of \nalcohol and marijuana during the interview. Applicant admitted that alcohol was more of \na problem for him, and said, \u201cI drank a half gallon of Vodka a day from the time I was 17 \nuntil I was 27.\u201d The psychologist noted that Applicant exhibited a more stable lifestyle \nsince 2011. Nonetheless, the present evaluation revealed that Applicant, by his own \nadmission, continued to suffer from psychiatric symptoms which interfered with his life. \nIt was also likely that Applicant continued to use alcohol and/or cannabis based on his \nprevious history, and his reluctance to frankly discuss the topic during his interview. \nBased on the review of past treatment records, clinical interview and observations, and \npersonality assessment, the psychologist determined Applicant appears to meet the \ncriteria for the following past and current DSM-5 disorders: \n \nBipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission; \nAlcohol Use Disorder, Severe, in remission; \nCannabis Use Disorder, Mild \nSocial Anxiety Disorder (with associated panic attacks).  \n \n\u201cCONCLUSION: Applicant\u2019s present mental status and interpersonal style appear \nto negatively impact his judgment and trustworthiness. Furthermore, if his historical \nmental health symptoms were to reemerge, his stability and reliability would almost \ncertainly be negatively impacted as well.\u201d (Tr. 29; GE 2) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges adverse financial information. Applicant attributed his \nfinancial problems due to the absence of financial aid during his last semester of \ncollege. In addition, he is a single parent, and he injured his back in 2016. His injury \ncaused him to suffer financially due to medical expenses and ultimately, expenses \nrelated to his back surgery in 2017. (Tr. 22) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-d allege that Applicant is indebted to the Department of Education \nfor four defaulted student loans totaling $23,246. Applicant denied all SOR allegations in \nhis response to the SOR since he does not believe the DOD should hold any unpaid \ndebt against him in the evaluation of his security clearance eligibility. At the hearing, \nApplicant admitted he currently owed approximately $34,000 for his defaulted student \nloans, even after his 2018 tax refund of $3,800 was involuntarily intercepted by the \nInternal Revenue Service toward payment of this debt. He was supposed to start \nrepaying his loans in 2015. He made a few payments, but admitted that he had not \nrecently made any payments on his loans. Instead, Applicant has been saving money in \nthe event he does not receive his security clearance and he is terminated by his \nemployer. The student loan debt is not currently being paid and is unresolved. (Tr. 17-\n19, 38; GE 3)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant is indebted to an apartment complex in the \namount of $1,895. Applicant stated that this debt originated from him breaking his lease \non an apartment while he was enrolled in college. Applicant has not resolved this debt. \n(Tr. 19-20; GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleges that Applicant is indebted to a collection agency in the amount \nof $493. Applicant denied this account and explained that due to the Equifax breach of \npersonal information, the financial accounts alleged in the SOR could be the result of \nthe security breach. He did not do any research concerning this account to determine if \nhe was responsible for the debt. This account has not been resolved. (Tr. 20; GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.g alleges that Applicant is indebted for an unpaid utility account in the \namount of $275. This debt surfaced about the same time Applicant broke his lease on \nthe apartment, noted above. He acknowledged this debt and stated that he had not \ntaken any steps to pay this account. This debt remains unsatisfied and unresolved. (Tr. \n20-21; GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h and 2.i allege that Applicant is indebted for two unpaid medical \naccounts in the approximate amount of $390. Applicant denied these accounts since he \nprovided the medical provider with his correct insurance information. He has not taken \nany other action with the creditor to obtain a final resolution of these unpaid medical \naccounts, nor did he provide any mitigating financial documentation with his SOR \nresponse, during the hearing, or when the record was held open for one month after his \nhearing. These medical debts are unresolved. (Tr. 21, 37; GE 3) \n \nApplicant provided four character reference letters during the hearing. (AE A-D) It \nappears that all four individuals have worked with him, and all characterized Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nas a trusted, dedicated employee. Only one of these individuals commented that he was \naware of Applicant\u2019s adverse financial issues in relation to his security clearance \neligibility. (AE B) None of the individuals, however, seemed to be aware of the \npsychological conditions security concerns alleged in the SOR. All four character \nreferences recommended Applicant be granted a security clearance. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern for psychological conditions: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \n \n \nThe medical information and report in evidence raised the following \nPsychological Conditions Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 28:  \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, or \ntrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed \nmedication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on \nApplicant\u2019s long history of multiple hospitalizations and treatment for Bipolar Disorder, \nPsychotic Disorder NOS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Alcohol \nDependence, Cannabis Dependence, and Polysubstance Dependence. His most recent \npsychological evaluation indicated Applicant\u2019s present mental status and interpersonal \n\n \n8 \n \n \nstyle negatively impact his judgment and trustworthiness. Allt he above disqualifying \nconditions apply.  \n \n \nI considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nApplicant has not received professional treatment or prescribed medications for \nhis diagnosed psychological issues since approximately 2011. He does not have any \nplans to seek mental health counseling in the future. In 2017, a qualified mental health \nprofessional determined that Applicant\u2019s condition was not fully under control and his \npresent mental status and interpersonal style appear to negatively impact his judgment \nand trustworthiness. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply.  \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n  \n \nApplicant provided some mitigating information by revealing that his finances \nwere harmed by his inability to obtain financial aid for his last semester in college, his \nback injury in 2016, and the resulting surgery and unpaid medical bills. He has been \nfully employed since 2015. Applicant chose to put extra money into a savings account in \nthe event he does not obtain a security clearance instead of paying money toward his \ndelinquent debts. He was put on notice with the receipt of his 2018 SOR that his \ndelinquent finances were a security concern.  \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments or arranged payment plans to address any of \nhis delinquent debts.  His 2018 income tax refund was intercepted recently as a partial \npayment towards repayment of his delinquent defaulted student loans because he failed \nto pay them voluntarily. This does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve debts \nor repay overdue creditors. His student loans total about $34,000, and five other debts \ntotal about an additional $3,000. He has not taken responsible action in his handling of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nhis student loans and other delinquent debt. Under the current circumstances, there are \nnot clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved, and his finances are \nnot under control. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old field services technician for a DOD contractor. He has \na long history of mental health problems and was on disability for his condition until \napproximately 2010. He has a strong mistrust of the mental health profession, and he \ndecided to stop his mental health treatment and prescribed medications in about 2011, \nagainst medical advice. During his 2017 mental health evaluation, Applicant admitted \nthat he continues to suffer mental health-related conditions. The licensed psychologist \nreported that he may be a security risk. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s defaulted student loans and five delinquent accounts currently total \nabout $37,000. Applicant has not made any voluntary payments or made arrangements \nwith overdue creditors to resolve his delinquencies. Despite being fully employed since \n2015, he did not show diligence, or even a good-faith effort, in the handling of his \nfinancial issues. Applicant\u2019s failure to take responsible action does not demonstrate \ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.i: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Hackett, Esq. \n06/27/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has filed all of his Federal and state income tax returns, and he has paid \nmost of his tax delinquencies. However, in light of the length of time these delinquencies \nwere outstanding, and the nature and seriousness of his conduct, it is too soon to conclude \nthat he has mitigated the security concern.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 29, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On August 1, 2018, Applicant answered the \nSOR, admitting the allegations except 1.i through 1.m. He requested a hearing, \nwhereupon, the case was assigned to me on November 1, 2018. On February 22, 2019, \n \n\n2 \n \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling \nApplicant\u2019s case for March 28, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received seven \nGovernment exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 7) and 18 Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A - AE R), together \nwith the testimony of Applicant and three character witnesses. Also, I received a copy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I).  At the close of the \nhearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request, to allow him the opportunity to submit \nadditional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted six exhibits which I incorporated \ninto the record as AE S through AE X.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019. \n \nPreliminary Ruling \n \n \n \nSOR subparagraphs 1.j through 1.m allege that Applicant has four outstanding \nparking tickets totaling $625. Applicant admits having been issued these parking tickets, \nbut denied the allegations, contending that he paid them. He provided evidence \ncorroborating proof of payment. (AE S) I resolve these subparagraphs in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old married man with two children, ages seven and two. He \nhas been married since July 2014. (Tr. 43) Two previous marriages ended in divorce. He \nwas married to his first wife from 2002 to 2004. (GE 1 at 17) He was married to his second \nwife from 2010 to 2014. (GE 1 at 18) They were separated approximately two years before \ntheir divorce. (Tr. 50) His oldest child is from his second marriage. \n \n \nApplicant is a veteran of the U.S. Navy, serving from 1988 to 1991. He received a \ndischarge under other than honorable conditions.  (Tr. 51; GE 1 at 13) Applicant has a high \nschool degree and has earned some technical school credits. \n \n \nApplicant is a system administrator. He has worked for the same employer at \nvarious locations since 1996. (Tr. 50) He is highly respected on the job. According to a \nformer supervisor, he was an excellent employee who worked day and night. Moreover, \u201cif \nsomething was bro[ken] at 3:00 AM, [Applicant\u2019s former supervisor] would call on him . . .  \nand he [would] work on it and get it fixed.\u201d (Tr. 31)  According to a coworker, whenever their \ngovernment client needed something fixed as soon as possible, they always requested \nApplicant first. (Tr. 21) Another coworker characterizes Applicant as a man of honor \ncharacter, and integrity. (Answer at 12)  \n \n \nIn January 2014, a lien was entered against Applicant\u2019s property for unpaid Federal \nincome taxes from tax years 2006 to 2008, totaling $87,950, as alleged in subparagraph \n1.d. (GE P at 4) There are no allegations that Applicant did not file his 2006 or 2007 federal \ntax returns on time. The record evidence indicates that, contrary to the allegation set forth \nin SOR subparagraph 1.b, Applicant did file his 2008 federal income tax return on time. \n(GE 2 at 17) Applicant contends that the debt from these years stemmed from an audit \nconducted a few years later that revealed that he owed more than he paid when he filed \nthe income tax returns. Specifically, as a contractor, Applicant files his federal income tax \n\n3 \n \nreturns using a 1099 form. (Tr. 109) Applicant owed additional money after the IRS \ndisallowed the business expenses that he claimed.  (Tr. 111) \n \n \nApplicant satisfied his 2008 Federal income tax delinquency with two payments \nmade in March 2019, totaling $39,363. (AE B at 3-5) It is unknown from the record whether \nhe has satisfied the tax delinquency from 2006 and 2007. Moreover, the evidence that the \nfederal tax lien for tax years 2006 through 2008 (subparagraph 1.d) has been released is \ninconclusive. \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2009 federal and state income tax returns on time, contrary to the \nallegation set forth in subparagraph 1.b. (AE B, AE T at 3; Tr. 60) He paid a $5,003 federal \nincome tax debt when he filed the return. (AE T at 3-4) Applicant owed no state income tax \ndelinquency from 2009. (AE N) \n \n \nFor tax years 2010 to 2016 Applicant filed his federal and state income returns late, \nas alleged in subparagraphs 1.b and1.g.  Specifically, he did not file his income tax returns \nfor 2010 until March 2014, (AE C at 1); he did not file his 2011 and 2012 income tax \nreturns until February 2016, (AE D at 1; AE E at 1); he did not file his 2013 income tax \nreturn until June 2015, (AE F at 1);  he did not file his 2014 income tax return until May \n2016, (AE G); and he did not file his 2015 income tax return until February 2019. (Tr. 87) \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax delinquency for tax year 2010 resulted in a lien against his \nproperty, filed in August 2014, in the amount of $7,113, as alleged in subparagraph 1.e. \n(AE O) \n \n \nContrary to the allegation set forth in subparagraph 1.b, Applicant filed his federal \nand state income tax return for 2017 on time. (AE J) He owes no delinquency for this tax \nyear. (AE T at 18) \n \n \nApplicant satisfied his delinquent income taxes from 2010 to 2016 through the \nfollowing payments:  \n \nYear \nAmount \nDate \nPaid \nBalance \nSource \n2010 \n$8,577 \n2/25/19 \n0 \nAE C at 3; AE T at 5 \n2011 \n$7,419 \n6/20/18 \n-$12.18 \nAE D  \n2012 \n$6,205 \n11/12/18 \n0 \nAE E  \n2013 \n$24,823 \n6/8/18 \n0 \nAE F  \n2014 \n$23,823 \n3/11/19 \n0 \nAE B at 4 \n2015 \n$13,625 \n2/12/19 \n0 \nAE H; AE T at 14 \n2016 \n$8,284 \n8/1/18 \n0 \nAE T at 17 \n \nApplicant\u2019s payment of his 2010 tax delinquency resulted in the release of a lien against his \nproperty, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d, in March 2019. (AE O) He made the tax \npayments with his credit card. At the end of each month that he made the payments, he \nwould typically pay his credit card balance, using money drawn from either his savings \n\n4 \n \naccount, or his checking account. (Tr. 72, 75, 98) His credit and retail card debt totals \napproximately $140,000. (AE K at 3; AE l at 2) All of his accounts are current. \n \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant requested a transcript of all of the state income tax returns \nthat had outstanding delinquencies.  (Tr. 93) Per the transcript, he owed $4,777 for tax \nyear 2014 and $2,265 for tax year 2015. (AE N at 1) Applicant paid the balance for tax year \n2015 on March 20, 2019. (AE N at 3) He is making monthly $311 payments on the 2014 \nbalance through an installment plan. (Answer at 20) \n \n \nIn April 2015, a lien was entered against Applicant\u2019s property for delinquent 2010 \nstate income taxes totaling $3,333, as alleged in subparagraph 1.i. This lien was released \nin June 2018 after Applicant paid the delinquency. (AE P at 1) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his failure to file or pay his federal and state income taxes timely \nto the deterioration of his second marriage, followed by his 2014 divorce and the ensuing \nlitigation that began when he filed for full custody of their child in December 2017. (AE Q at \n4). Their marriage began deteriorating shortly Applicant\u2019s wife had their child in 2012. (Tr. \n53)  Their separation was particularly bitter because Applicant raised allegations that his \nsecond wife was physically abusing their daughter. Fearing for his daughter\u2019s safety, \nApplicant spared no expense during the divorce proceedings, hiring one of the best family \nlaw attorneys in the state, who told him that his legal fees would range between $100,000 \nand $150,000. (Tr. 123)  Applicant then began saving money to pay the attorney. Some of \nthe money ordinarily would have been set aside to pay income taxes. (Tr. 54-56) \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant went on a tropical cruise. (Tr. 119; GE 1 at 29) He spent \napproximately $5,000. (Tr. 120) In late 2014, approximately nine months after his divorce \nfrom his second wife was finalized, Applicant traveled out of the country to visit his current \nwife\u2019s family.  His in-laws paid for most of the expenses. He spent approximately $1,400.  \n \n \nApplicant earns $113,000 per year. He has approximately $15,000 deposited in a \nsavings account, and $15,000 invested in a 401k plan. (Tr. 126) He has $2,000 of monthly \ndiscretionary income. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n\n5 \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . .  An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. \n \n \n Applicant failed to file his federal or state income tax returns on time between 2010 \nand 2016, incurring delinquencies in excess of $100,000. Moreover, although he filed his \n2008 federal income tax return on time, he failed to pay the amount due, totaling \napproximately $39,000, on time. Consequently, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 \n\n6 \n \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file . . . \nfederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax, as required,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nThe following migrating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed, and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant contends that his failure to timely file his income tax returns or to timely \npay the corresponding taxes stem from the emotionally draining litigation related to the \ndivorce from his second wife. Since the culmination of both the divorce and the custody \nproceedings, Applicant has filed his tax returns and satisfied all of the delinquencies except \na $4,800 state tax delinquency, which he is paying through an installment plan. AG \u00b6 20g) \nand the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(c) apply.  \n \n \nApplicant did not make any significant payments towards his income tax \ndelinquencies until after the SOR was issued. By then, the oldest tax debts had been \ndelinquent for approximately eight years. The emotionally compelling circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s divorce are undercut by the fact that Applicant\u2019s 2010 income tax \nreturns were not filed, and its corresponding balance was already delinquent by the end of \n2011, before Applicant\u2019s child was born and before his marital problems dramatically \nworsened. Also, despite having significant delinquent income tax debt and income tax \nreturns that had not been filed, Applicant spent $5,000 to take a tropical cruise, and later \nspent $1,400 to travel out of the country to visit his parents in-law. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant did not merely fail to file timely or pay one or two tax returns late; he failed \nto timely file tax returns or pay his income tax debts for several consecutive years. As such, \nhe violated Federal law with impunity. Applicant is a well-respected employee with an \nexceptional work history. He offered emotionally compelling testimony involving the \ncircumstances surround the custody dispute and its relationship to his failure to file his \n\n7 \n \nincome tax returns or to pay his tax debt. These factors, however, are insufficient to \nmitigate the security concern, given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s long-time \ndelay in filing his income tax returns and the length of time that elapsed before he satisfied \nthem. I conclude Applicant failed to carry the burden. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant: \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j -1.m \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.1 \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP) on May \n18, 2017. On May 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F.2 \n1 Applicant is requesting a trustworthiness determination for access to sensitive information, also known as \na \u201cpublic trust\u201d determination, to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) position. \n2 The DOD CAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n02/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and elected to have the case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief with supporting documents, \nknown as the File of Relevant Material (FORM), was submitted by Department Counsel \non August 6, 2018. \n \nA complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 15, 2018, and she \nsubmitted a response to the FORM (AE A), dated September 4, 2018, including attached \ndocuments. The Government\u2019s exhibits included in the FORM (Items 1 to 10) and AE A \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old medical clerk employed by a defense contractor. She \nhas been consistently employed since 2013 with her sponsoring employer (Item 3).  \nApplicant was married in 2007 and divorced in 2016. She has three children. \nThe SOR alleges multiple (21) delinquent debts, including consumer collection and \ncharged-off accounts; vehicle repossession and medical accounts totaling about $30,000. \nApplicant denied all SOR allegations and stated that the debts were being disputed or \nremoved through a credit repair service. (Item2) She explained that several of the debts \nare the result of her divorce and that her ex-husband is responsible for those delinquent \naccounts. Applicant noted that she had made some poor choices with her money and \ncredit. (Item 5) She also noted that she and her then husband over extended themselves \nwith credit cards in 2011, and in 2015, he asked for a divorce and left town. She stated \nthat it was her intention to consolidate the debt and pay $99 a month to the service to \nsettle the debts or have them removed. (Item 5)  There is nothing in the record to support \nthat claim. She stated in her interrogatories that she had not paid any of the debts, but \nthey were going to be in a payment plan. (Item 6) She did not submit any supporting \ninformation. She presented letters of dispute to challenge accounts with her answer. (Item \n5)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she noted that she has worked in the \nhealthcare industry since 1996, and recently was chosen as \u201cemployee of the year.\u201d She \nsubmitted individual letters that she wrote in 2018 to each creditor regarding validation of \nthe various debts. (AE A) No additional documentary evidence of debt resolution or \ncurrent financial status was submitted. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \n\n \n3 \n \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe documentary evidence supporting the SOR allegations and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n  \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s divorce in 2016 is the cited reason for the delinquent debts \nand the overspending during the marriage, Applicant has disputed the debts through a \nrepair service. She also stated that she would consolidate the debts and arrange to have \nthem settled or removed. Applicant states that her husband was to have paid many of the \ndebts, but he did not.  \n \n  \nApplicant did not submit any documentation that she has made any efforts to pay \nher delinquent debts, except to write letters of dispute in 2018. She has not provided \nevidence that the credit repair service is paying any of the debts. She has not shown \nsufficient justification for responsible action. Despite her consistent employment, her \nfinancial responsibility is questionable. Likewise, she has not provided any evidence of \nefforts to resolve her debts, or that her financial situation is under control. No mitigating \nconditions fully apply. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant has not shown evidence of resolution of the SOR debts despite her \nattestations to the contrary. I considered the factors that may have led to Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties. However, the limited information in the record has not convinced me \nthat Applicant has made sufficient efforts to resolve her debts, or that she is financially \nresponsible. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n         Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access \nto sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Williams, Esquire, Department Counsel \n  Andre Gregorian, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication \nFacility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct).1 In a response notarized on June 4, 2018, Applicant admitted all but one of \nthe allegations. He also requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on January 24, 2019.  \nA hearing originally scheduled for December 5, 2018, was cancelled due to \ninclement weather. A December 12, 2018, notice, setting the hearing for January 24, \n2019, was issued. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after September 1, 2006. Subsequently amended, the AG applied \nhere are applicable for any adjudication on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/15/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nThe Government offered three documents, accepted into the record without \nobjection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-3. Applicant gave testimony and proffered three exhibits, \naccepted without objection as Exs. A-C. The record was held open through February 8, \n2019, so that additional materials could be offered. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nFebruary 5, 2019. With no supplemental materials received, the record was closed on \nFebruary 8, 2019. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old data center technician who has worked for the same \nemployer for about three years. He is currently earning about $68,000 a year. He came \nto that job in 2015, after a colleague helped him find a new position when his former \njob\u2019s salary was cut from $86,000 a year to $40,000 due to a contract renegotiation. He \nhas maintained some level of security clearance since 1992. Applicant completed two \nyears of college before earning a degree from a technical school as an electronic \ntechnician. Widowed over a decade ago, he has two grown children: a son, currently \nsupported in part by Applicant while he completes college, and a daughter, who has \ncompleted college and presently living at home. (Tr. 14)  \n \n \nIn the past several years, Applicant has acquired debts which have become \ndelinquent. He experienced a period of unemployment from May 2013 to September \n2013.2 He has been trying to earn supplementary income by driving for a car service \npart time. (Tr. 18) Because he has owned his home for 25 years, he has built up notable \nequity. He is in the process of refinancing the home in order to satisfy the debts at \nissue. (Tr. 18-19) No documentary evidence of negotiations related to this effort was \npresented. The debts at issue in the SOR are: \n \n \n1.a \u2013 Student loan collection account ($17,744) \u2013 Unpaid. Applicant promised his \nlate wife that he would make sure their children were educated. Applicant took special \ncare to make sure his daughter went to college because she has a learning disability. \n(Tr. 17) Applicant took this loan for her education between 2010 and 2012, and \nultimately another loan for his son. Applicant reported that he has spoken to the lender \nabout his financial situation and his strategy for resolving his debt, he but provided no \ndocumentary evidence reflecting such communication. (Tr. 19-20) The loan balance \nremains unaddressed. (Tr. 18) \n \n \n1.b \u2013 Charged-off account ($8,063) \u2013 Unpaid. This credit card debt was incurred \nwhen Applicant\u2019s children were in college. The last activity on this account was from \n2013, the year Applicant\u2019s son started college. Applicant does not recall the \ncircumstances under which this debt became delinquent. (Tr. 23) He is hoping to \naddress this debt with his home refinancing proceeds as well. (Tr. 23) \n                                                          \n2  This was Applicant\u2019s most significant period of unemployment. He had shorter lapses of unemployment \nbetween contracts over his career that \u201clasted no more than approximately a month or two.\u201d (Tr. 36) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n1.c \u2013 May 2015 judgment related to a pest control service ($1,043) \u2013 Unpaid. \nApplicant testified that he made two $150 payments in mid-2018 toward this delinquent \ndebt, but was unable to provide documentation to that effect.  \n \n \n1.d \u2013 Telecommunication collection account ($1,712) \u2013 Unpaid. This debt is \nrelated to a cell phone service plan from about 2013. The charges on the phone had \nbecome unwieldy. When this provider would not reduce his charges or his terms, he \naccepted an offer from another company which said it would \u201ctake care\u201d of this bill. (Tr. \n32) He believed this satisfied the balance. Only later did he learn the balance was still \nowed. The debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 33)   \n \n \n1.e \u2013 Collection account ($6,185) \u2013 Unpaid. This account is related to a \ntimeshare property for which Applicant used to pay $240 a month. It was acquired in \nabout 2003 or 2004. Applicant testified that he has been paying on this delinquent debt \nbalance since 2017 through payroll deductions. (Tr. 38) Applicant provided no \ndocumentation reflecting such deductions or payments. \n \n \n1.f \u2013 Medical collection ($135) \u2013 Applicant believes this may actually be related to \na jewelry store account. He thought the debt was paid, but failed to provide any \ndocumentary evidence reflecting that status.  \n \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). He answered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 \nDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts Other than previously listed, have any of the \nfollowing happened? . . . In the past seven (7) years, you defaulted on any type of loan? \n. . . In the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency? . . . In the past seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?\u201d He similarly answered \u201cno\u201d in \nresponse to \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Enforcement Other \nthan previously listed, have any of the following happened to you? . . . In the past seven \n(7) years, you had a judgment entered against you?\u201d As noted above, the answer to \nboth queries should have been \u201cyes,\u201d as Applicant later admitted in his SOR response.  \n \nWith regard to the first inaccurate answer, Applicant\u2019s explanation was that he \nwas \u201cterrified\u201d about his debts and \u201cmade a bad error in judgment,\u201d for which he humbly \napologizes. (Tr. 41) He was \u201coverwhelmed and scared at the time [that he would lose \nhis security clearance and job]. . . .\u201d (Tr. 45) He remains worried about his poor \njudgment in this matter. With regard to the second inaccurate answer, however, \nApplicant \u201cdidn\u2019t really know what a judgment is. . . . I had no idea really.\u201d (Tr. 45) \n \n \n \nCurrently, Applicant earns a net monthly income of about $3,600 a month. He \ncontinues as a part-time driver intermittently, which can supplement his income with an \nadditional $300-$400 a month. Such surplus funds are generally applied to everyday \nneeds, such as groceries. (Tr. 44) He is current on his mortgage payments. He expends \na lot of money on prescription co-pays due to health problems including diabetes, high \nblood pressure, and optical issues. After he pays all of his monthly bills, he retains some \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nmoney \u201cevery blue moon,\u201d which he sends to his son. (Tr. 49) His daughter helps \ncontribute toward household expenses. Applicant has about $50 in his savings account \nand no retirement or 401k retirement account. He has not received financial counseling. \nApplicant concedes that he is living paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 57) \n \n \nA co-worker and friend of Applicant noted that Applicant is dedicated to his job \nand this country. He cited Applicant\u2019s commitment to his children and his child \nmentoring as a coach. He applauded Applicant\u2019s resilience over the past few years with \nregard to his fluctuations in salary. (Ex. A) A former supervisor of Applicant\u2019s noted that \nApplicant\u2019s friendly and energetic personality helped keep his grueling workdays \npositive and upbeat. (Ex. B) He further wrote that Applicant is personable, pleasant, \nhonest, and a \u201cstand-up guy\u201d. (Ex. B) Another colleague expressed that Applicant is a \ntrustworthy and able professional capable of safeguarding information. (Ex. C) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision after a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. Decisions are in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas numerous delinquent debts and an adverse judgment. This is sufficient to invoke \nfinancial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n          There are multiple delinquent debts at issue. There is no documentary evidence \nreflecting any payments made, or efforts to settle or address any of the debts at issue in \nthe SOR. While a part-time job was an effective way to increase his income to some \ndegree, the proceeds from that job were used to pay for everyday expenses, not pay \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndown delinquent debt. Regardless, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part with regard to the \ncreation of these delinquent debts noted in the SOR.  \n \nWith regard to the actual delinquent debts at issue, they have been neglected or \nunaddressed for some time. His assertion that he made a couple of payments on the \ndebts at 1c and 1.f, and was in repayment through payroll deduction on the debt at 1.e \nwas not substantiated by documentary evidence. Moreover, there is no documentary \nevidence reflecting that his plan to satisfy these debts by refinancing his home has been \nimplemented or is financially manageable. Without such documentation, none of the \navailable mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nHere, Applicant failed to disclose delinquent accounts and an adverse judgment \non his eQIP. Therefore, if Applicant\u2019s answers were intentionally false or meant to \nmislead or misrepresent, the following disqualifying condition could apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he provided a false answer with regard to eQIP Section \n26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts because he was \nscared. While he has most contritely apologized, he remains scared about his false \nanswer, an issue he did not immediately correct. This admission raises AG \u00b6 16(a) and, \ngiven the facts here, obviates application of any of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17. \nHowever, he was very credible in his admission that he was then unaware of what a \njudgment was, leading him to a negative answer with regard to Section 26 \u2013 Financial \nRecord \u2013 Delinquency Involving Enforcement on the eQIP. In finding no falsity or intent \nto mislead in this answer, I find that AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to allegation 2.b. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old data center technician who has worked for the same \nemployer for about three years, currently earning about $68,000 a year. He came to that \njob in 2015, after suffering a large drop in income (from $86,000 to $40,000) due to a \ncontract renegotiation. He has maintained some level of security clearance since 1992. \nApplicant completed two years of college before earning a degree from a technical \nschool. He is a widower with two grown children. He occasionally helps his son \nfinancially when he can. His son is away at college and his daughter, a college \ngraduate, currently lives with him and contributes toward household expenses.   \n \nThe main source of Applicant\u2019s financial distress is hard to determine, but \nmeeting his promise to his late wife to make sure the children were college educated \nhas taken an economic toll. At present he owes about $35,000 in delinquent debts, \nnearly half of which is comprised of delinquent student loans. Applicant believes he has \nmade some payments on at least three of the six accounts at issue, but he provided no \ndocumentary evidence reflecting such efforts. While he has devised a plan to address \nhis debts by seeking a home refinance, no documentation was provided reflecting such \na plan has been initiated, implemented, or is manageable. Meanwhile, Applicant has \nconceded that he is presently living paycheck to paycheck. Consequently, it is unclear \nhow any efforts to address these delinquent debts might be initiated in the near future. \n \nApplicant contritely confessed that he misrepresented the truth on his 2016 eQIP \nwhen he denied having had any bills or debts turned over to collection, charged off, or in \ndefault in the preceding seven years. Under the facts offered, this falsity cannot be \nmitigated. However, his denial of having any adverse judgments against him in the \nsame time period was based on confusion and not an intent to mislead. Taking all these \nfactors together, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate both financial considerations and \npersonal conduct security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

His tax filings for those four years were not timely. He currently \nowes about $65,000 in delinquent federal income taxes, and he does not have a payment \nplan which is agreeable to the IRS. He owes $11,928 for delinquent state income taxes \nfor tax year 2018. Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and E (personal conduct) security \nconcerns are mitigated; however, Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns \nare not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.        \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn August 7, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n\n2 \n                                         \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F, G, and E.  \nOn October 22, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On January 2, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 7, \n2019, the case was assigned to an administrative judge, and on June 27, 2019, the case \nwas transferred to me for administrative reasons. On June 13, 2019, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July \n18, 2019. (HE 1A) On July 2, 2019, DOHA rescheduled the hearing for July 31, 2019. (HE \n1B)    \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 9 exhibits; Applicant offered 13 \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 21-25; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-9; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE M). On \nAugust 9, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.   \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 2.b through \n2.e, and 3.a through 3.e. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. \n(HE 3) Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact \nfollow.   \nApplicant is a 43-year-old aircraft maintenance specialist in flight test mechanics \nwho has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2007. (Tr. 10, 13, 27) In \n1995, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 10) He attended college for several years; \nhowever, he did not receive a degree. (Tr. 10) He served in the Navy from 1998 to 2001, \nand he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 10-11) In 2001, he \nmarried; in 2010, he separated from his spouse; and in 2012, he divorced. (Tr. 11-12, 28) \nHis children are ages 13 and 16. (Tr. 12) \nFinancial Considerations \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant owes federal income taxes of $19,010 for tax \nyear 2011 and $5,096 for tax year 2012. He filed his 2011 and 2012 federal income tax \nreturns in April 2013. (Tr. 29-30) He has been aware that he owed federal income taxes \nsince April 2013. (Tr. 30) More details about his payments to address delinquent taxes \nare contained in this section, infra. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state M tax \nreturns for tax years 2013 through 2016. He said he filed his 2013 through 2016 federal \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nand state M tax returns in 2019. (Tr. 31) However, he might have filed those tax returns \nin the last half of 2018, based on the payments he made after June 2018, and his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories indicating he planned to file his tax returns in June \n2018. (GE 2) Filing was somewhat delayed by a flood around 2012 and 2013 and possibly \nby his divorce, which was final in 2012. (Tr. 31)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege Applicant owes state M income taxes as follows: $5,537 \nfor tax year 2003; and a total of $10,572 for tax years 2011 and 2012. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges \nin March 2014, a state M tax lien was filed against Applicant for $7,597. On September \n21, 2018, Applicant paid the state M tax authority $20,000 by cashier\u2019s check, and state \nM released the hold on Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. (AE J; AE K) In October 2018, \nApplicant paid the state M tax authority a total of $7,934 by cashier\u2019s checks. (AE L; AE \nM) He currently has a 2018 state M tax debt of $11,928, which is not alleged in the SOR. \n(Tr. 39) He has not made any payments to address his 2018 state M tax debt. (Tr. 40)   \n \nThe documentation Applicant submitted is summarized in the following table. \n \nTax \nYear \nFederal Tax \nDebt \nFederal Tax \nPayment \nState \nDebt \nExhibits \n2011 \n$14,296 \n \n$5,080 \nGE 2 at 19; AE I \n2012 \n$3,565 \n \n$5,713 \nGE 2 at 26; AE I \n2013 \n$8,601 \n \n$0 \nTr. 32-33, 65-67; AE C; AE I \n2014 \n$4,165 \n \n$0 \nTr. 33, 67; AE D; AE I \n2015 \n$9,274 \n$4,025 \n$5,570 \nTr. 34, 67; AE E; AE I \n2016 \n$7,244 \n \n$5,087 \nAE F; AE I \n2017 \n$11,017 \n \n$6,114 \nAE G; AE I \n2018 \n$36,082 \n$11,928 \n$11,928 \nTr. 36-40; AE H \n \n Applicant\u2019s annual salary is about $85,000. (Tr. 28) On May 1, 2019, the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) wrote Applicant and established a payment plan to address his \ntax debts for tax years 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (AE A) It is unclear why some \nof the tax years were not listed that are depicted as delinquent in the above table. For \nexample, the federal tax debt for tax year 2018 of $36,082 does not appear to have been \nincluded in the installment agreement. Applicant\u2019s federal tax debt for 2018 was $36,082, \nwhich resulted from withdrawals from his 401(k) account, which has been almost \nexhausted. (Tr. 36-37, 71) According to the May 1, 2019 IRS installment agreement, his \nmonthly payments were supposed to be $1,000 with the first payment due on May 25, \n2019. (AE A) He provided page 1 of the agreement. (AE A) In May 2019, he paid $100; \nin June 2019, he paid $200; and in July 2019, he paid $100. (AE B) He is renegotiating \nthe payment plan because he believed the IRS erred and overestimated his gross annual \nincome or ability to pay the tax debt. (Tr. 35) He planned to pay the IRS $200 a month \nuntil the monthly payment to the IRS is renegotiated. (Tr. 36-37)  \n \nOn April 29, 2019, Applicant paid the IRS $42,463, which was used to address his \ntax debt for 2012. (Tr. 32, 65; AE B) From December 3, 2018 to July 8, 2019, he made \none payment of $3,563, one payment of $2,022, six payments from $1,000 to $2,000, \nand seven payments from $100 to $500 during this time period. (AE B) He estimated that \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nhe owed the federal government about $65,000 after he was credited for his $42,463 \npayment when his home was refinanced. (Tr. 32-35, 37) He hopes to net about $45,000 \non the sale of his residence, and he wants to use those funds to pay his tax debt. (Tr. 38) \nHe is also working overtime to obtain additional income to address his delinquent tax \ndebt. (Tr. 40) \n \nAlcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a allege that around 1999, Applicant was charged with driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI), and in 2000, he was charged with driving while \nlicense suspended. (Tr. 40-41, 45, 64) He received deferred prosecution for five years for \nthe DUI, and the DUI charge was later dismissed after his successful completion of his \nprobation; however, he was convicted of driving with a suspended license. (Tr. 41) His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. (Tr. 41-42)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges in May 2000 while Applicant was in the Navy, he received \ndisciplinary action for failure to obey an order. Applicant violated the order of a chief petty \nofficer who told him to remove his sunglasses when he was on a vessel. (Tr. 43; GE 6 at \n32) He had consumed alcohol ashore before the incident. (Tr. 44) He received nonjudicial \npunishment for disobeying the order of the chief petty officer. (Tr. 44) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. alleges in September 2001, Applicant received a general discharge \nfrom the Navy due to alcohol rehabilitation failure. After the 1999 DUI, Applicant \nvolunteered to attend alcohol counseling. (Tr. 45) After the incident with the chief petty \nofficer in 2000, Applicant was discharged from the Navy for alcohol rehabilitation failure. \n(Tr. 45-47) \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges in December 2001, Applicant was charged with \nassault/domestic violence. He struggled with his spouse and took the keys to his truck \nfrom her. (Tr. 48-49) He conceded under state law the struggle constituted assault. (Tr. \n49) He was not under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 48) He attended anger management; \nhe was convicted of assault; and he received probation for two years. (Tr. 47-49) \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges in June 2007, Applicant was charged with petty theft/shoplifting. \nHe wanted to purchase sunglasses at a military exchange. (Tr. 49-50) A sales person \nwould not assist him with the purchase. (Tr. 49-51) According to the January 29, 2008 \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he took the tag \noff of the sunglasses and left his old sunglasses on the counter. (GE 2 at 67-68) During \nhis February 14, 2013, and January 18, 2018 OPM PSIs, and at his hearing, he said he \nput some money on the counter, and then he took the sunglasses. (Tr. 51; GE 2 at 77, \n85) The January 29, 2008 OPM PSI does not mention that he left money on the counter \nfor the sunglasses. (GE 2 at 67-68) The theft charge was dismissed after he completed \n40 hours of community service. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 67-68)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges in February 2009, Applicant was charged with second degree \nassault of his spouse. Applicant was upset because his spouse was mismanaging the \nfamily finances. (Tr. 52) Applicant took her phone from her and threw it against the wall. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \n(Tr. 52) When he took her phone, he grabbed her arm and left a red mark on her wrist. \n(Tr. 53) She did not testify against Applicant, and the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 53) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges in June 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle \nwhile under the influence of alcohol (OWI). (Tr. 54-55) A police officer stopped him for \nspeeding and gave him a breath alcohol test (BAT) because they could smell tequila on \nhis breath. (Tr. 56) His BAT result exceeded .08. (Tr. 56) He pleaded guilty to this offense \nand received five years of probation before judgment, and he completed an alcohol-\neducation class. (Tr. 57-58) After successful completion of probation, the charge was \ndismissed. (Tr. 57) He was allowed to consume alcohol during probation. (Tr. 57-59) \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.e alleges in January 2014, Applicant was charged with driving on a \nsuspended license. His case was placed on the Stet docket. He explained that he \ncompleted all requirements for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, and the state \nerroneously failed to completely process and reinstate his driver\u2019s license. (Tr. 59) The \ncharge was dismissed. (Tr. 59-60) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges in June 2017, Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct. \nHe was subsequently convicted of disturbing the peace/obstruct public area. He had \nconsumed alcohol prior to this arrest. Applicant and a friend were wrestling or \n\u201croughhousing,\u201d and Applicant fell and cut his head on some concrete. (Tr. 60-61) \nApplicant had consumed a beer before the wrestling occurred. (Tr. 60) Applicant and his \nfriend were taken to jail. (Tr. 61) Applicant said his conviction was equivalent to a traffic \ninfraction. (Tr. 62) \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.f alleges the same information that is in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.e. Applicant \nhas not been charged with any offenses since June 2017, and he is not on probation. (Tr. \n63) Applicant has not consumed sufficient alcohol to the extent to become intoxicated for \nabout two years. (Tr. 68-69) He ended his alcohol consumption almost one year ago. (Tr. \n64) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d  \n \n  \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 through 2016. The IRS wrote that his delinquent taxes for tax years 2011 and 2012 \nwere included in his installment plan, which is an indication he still owes taxes for those \ntax years. The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s former spouse mismanaged the family finances, and he was divorced \nin 2012. Records were lost or damaged in a flood around 2012 or 2013. These are \ncircumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his record collection and \napplication of his time and energy to address his taxes. However, these circumstances \nare insufficiently detailed to prove he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he failed to pay his federal and state income taxes \nfor tax years 2013 through 2018 in full when due. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not \nalleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The allegation that he failed to pay his \nfederal and state income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2018 in full when due will not \nbe considered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nIn 2019, he filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016; \nhowever, his filings of tax returns for those tax years were not timely. He also paid over \n$80,000 towards his delinquent federal and state tax debts in the last two years.  \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \nEven if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal Board provided the \nfollowing principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies in part because he filed his tax returns and paid some of his required taxes; \nhowever, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the \ngrant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to file his federal \nand state tax returns on time. Applicant does not currently have a plan in place that is \nagreeable to the IRS to address his delinquent federal tax debt of about $65,000. He \nowes state M taxes of $11,928 for tax year 2018. Applicant failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations security concerns. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the alcohol consumption security concern as follows. \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant engaged in alcohol-related driving offenses involving DUI and OVI and \noffenses involving disturbing the peace and disobeying an order. He was discharged from \nthe Navy due to alcohol-rehabilitation failure. He drank alcohol to intoxication as recently \nas two years ago. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \nApplicant was arrested or punished for four alcohol-related offenses in 1999, 2000, \n2012, and 2017. These offenses resulted in nonjudicial punishment for disobeying an \norder in 2000, his discharge from the Navy, and one conviction in 2017 for disturbing the \npeace. He has not consumed sufficient alcohol to the extent of intoxication for about two \nyears. He ended his alcohol consumption about one year ago. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies. Alcohol \nconsumption security concerns are mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concern related to personal conduct as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant was arrested for DUI, OVI, assault, theft, driving on a suspended license, \nand disturbing the peace. He was convicted of driving with a suspended license, assault, \ntheft, and disturbing the peace. His commander determined he committed the offense of \ndisobeying an order during a nonjudicial punishment proceeding. The record establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1) through (3) and 16(e)(1). \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e) and 17(f) apply. Applicant and his spouse engaged in \nsome arguments that became physical, and he was arrested twice for assault. The victim, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, did not require hospitalization. He is no longer married and additional \nassault offenses are unlikely to occur. Applicant\u2019s theft of sunglasses, driving with a \nsuspended license, and disobeying an order are either minor offenses or not recent or \nboth. One driving with a suspended license was unsubstantiated. Applicant disclosed his \noffenses, and he is not vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. Personal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated.       \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F, G, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old aircraft maintenance specialist in flight test mechanics \nwho has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2007. Applicant is a high \nschool graduate, and he attended college for several years; however, he did not receive \na degree. He served in the Navy from 1998 to 2001, and he received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions. In 2001, he married; in 2010, he separated from his spouse; \nand in 2012, he divorced.  \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating evidence. With the end of his \nmarriage, domestic violence allegations have not recurred. He ended his alcohol \nconsumption almost one year ago. Applicant has also taken an important step towards \nshowing his financial responsibility. He presented some circumstances beyond his control \nthat adversely affected his finances and filing of his tax returns. In 2019, he filed his state \nand federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016. He also paid over \n$80,000 towards his delinquent federal and state tax debts in the last two years. \n \nThe evidence against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is more \nsubstantial. Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2014, 2015, and 2016 in 2019. His tax filings for those four years were not timely. He \ncurrently owes $11,928 in delinquent state income taxes and about $65,000 in delinquent \nfederal income taxes, and he does not have a payment plan which is agreeable to the \nIRS to address his federal tax debt. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge \nis required to consider how long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether \nthe IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises \nto begin and complete making payments. \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant knew that he needed to file his state \nand federal income tax returns for several years. He had a legal requirement to timely file \nhis tax returns. He may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of timely \nfiling of tax returns. He procrastinated. His actions in 2019 under the Appeal Board \njurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future.  \n \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Alcohol \nconsumption and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated; however, financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f: Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and criminal \nmisconduct. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nOn September 20, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-\nQIP). On May 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol) and J \n(Criminal Conduct). (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on June 14, 2018, and July 9, 2018. \n(Item 2.)

Department Counsel sent the Government\u2019s written case to Applicant on \n02/01/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nAugust 31, 2018, and sent a duplicate copy to an updated address on October 2, 2018. \nApplicant received a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing \nsix Items, on October 4, 2018. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of \nthe FORM. Applicant did not submit anything in response to the FORM within the 30-\nday period that ended November 3, 2018. DOHA assigned the case to me on January \n16, 2019. Items 1 through 6 are admitted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and is a college graduate. He has worked for his \nemployer, a government contractor, since September 2016. He is unmarried and has no \nchildren. (Item 3.) Applicant admitted all of the allegations on the SOR, with \nclarifications, as stated in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e, and 2.a.

(Item 3; Item 4; \nItem 5.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions may apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has had five alcohol-related arrests between 2007 and 2017. Four of \nthose incidents were DUI convictions, and one was an alcohol-related trespassing \ncharge. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of exercising poor judgment when consuming alcohol. \nDespite completing multiple alcohol counseling classes and serving jail time, he \nrepeatedly continued to consume alcohol to the point of impairment and then get behind \nthe wheel of a motor vehicle. His alcohol use continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. He failed to present sufficient evidence to fully \nestablish any of the mitigating conditions. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. The following applies, as discussed below: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n \nApplicant has been convicted of four DUIs, and admitted consuming alcohol \nbefore his trespassing arrest. This evidence raises security concerns under these \ndisqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal history is recent, with his most recent conviction occurring \nafter he completed his 2016 security clearance application. He provided no evidence of \nrehabilitation or changed behavior. The evidence continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under any of the above conditions. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubt \nas to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines for alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His information is \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns about his financial problems. His request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 10, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for a security clearance \nrequired for his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn August 24, 2018, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines cited in the SOR were issued \nby the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on March 11, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing on May 22, \n2019. The parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 5, 2019. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. \nApplicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A - C. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. Additionally, I held the record open after the hearing to receive \nadditional relevant information. The record closed on June 17, 2019, after I received \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions (AX D \u2013 E) and Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of \nobjections to their admissibility. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $31,021 for seven \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.g). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nall of the allegations without explanation. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and by the information presented with his Answer, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since December \n2010. He first received a clearance in 2011 and is now applying for renewal of his eligibility \nfor access to classified information. His work directly supports ongoing military missions \nand he deployed for work in a combat zone from late 2010 until April 2012. (GX 2) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have been married since June 2000. They have one child \n(age 17) together, but also raised her two children (ages 26 and 27) from a previous \nmarriage. Applicant also has a 26-year-old daughter born before his marriage. (GX 1; GX \n2; Tr. 35 \u2013 36) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife separated for about nine months in 2015 after his wife had \nan extramarital affair. Applicant attributes his financial problems to expenses that arose \nduring the separation. Those expenses included monthly child support for his minor child \nand legal fees incurred in anticipation of a divorce. Applicant and his wife reconciled but \nhe was unable to keep making payments on a car he had purchased in March 2012. \nApplicant called the dealer and had the car voluntarily repossessed. The debt alleged at \nSOR 1.a is for the loan balance after resale. Additionally, in June 2014, Applicant co-\n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nsigned the purchase of a car with one of his stepchildren, who subsequently became \nunemployed and stopped making payments. Applicant claims the matter is being resolved \nby his stepchild and that the debt (SOR 1.b) will soon be removed from Applicant\u2019s credit \nhistory. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX E; Tr. 30 \u2013 35) \n \n \nAnother debt Applicant accrued is a delinquent credit card account alleged at SOR \n1.c. Applicant repaid that debt in February 2019. (GX 3; AX D; Tr. 47) \n \n \nAvailable information also attributed to Applicant the four past-due medical bills \nalleged at SOR 1.d \u2013 1.g. Applicant produced information that shows he paid the debt at \nSOR 1.e, and that the other bills were prematurely referred to collection because \nApplicant\u2019s medical insurance had not yet processed his claims for coverage. The record \nevidence shows SOR 1.d \u2013 1.g have been resolved. (GX 2; GX 3; AX C; Tr. 43 \u2013 47) \n \n \nApplicant is in the process of repaying the car repossession debt at SOR 1.a. He \nand his wife have included the debt in a debt consolidation and resolution program \nApplicant\u2019s wife began to resolve three debts of her own. Together they pay $528 each \nmonth to resolve their four outstanding debts. (AX B; Tr. 38 \u2013 43) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances are currently sound and he has not incurred any new unpaid \ndebts. Together they earn about $91,000 annually. He and his wife have separate bank \naccounts; however, they manage the household finances together and are meeting all of \ntheir regular obligations (e.g., mortgage, car payments, insurance, and utilities). Applicant \ndoes not use credit cards and estimates he has about $300 remaining each month after \npaying his part of the household expenses. He and his wife file their income tax returns \nas required, and other than his wife\u2019s debt consolidation program, they have not sought \nfinancial counseling or other professional assistance to resolve their financial problems. \n(Tr. 48 \u2013 51) \n \n \nApplicant has a good reputation at work. His supervisor for the last seven years \nspeaks highly of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, hard work, reliability, and adherence to rules \nand regulations in handling sensitive information. (AX A) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts, \ntotaling $31,021. Available information also showed that his debts remained unresolved \nas of August 2018. That information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nBy contrast, the record also requires application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he and his wife separated for about \nnine months in 2015. During that time, he incurred extra expenses, such as legal fees \nand child support. He fell behind on his car payments and a credit card, and after he and \nhis wife reconciled, Applicant could not afford his missed payments. He voluntarily \nrelinquished his car, but still owes a significant remainder after the car was resold. He is \nresolving that debt through a credit consolidation and repayment plan his wife has been \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nusing to resolve her own debts. As to his delinquent credit card account, Applicant has \npaid that debt and no longer uses credit cards. As for the medical debts alleged in the \nSOR, information developed at hearing shows they either have been resolved or were \nprematurely referred for collection. As to the car repossession debt for his son\u2019s car, there \nis no documentation that supports Applicant\u2019s claim his stepson is rectifying that \ndeficiency. The debt arose not long after Applicant and his wife reconciled. As with his \nother obligations at the time, Applicant was unable to make the required payments; \nhowever, he was credible in his assertions that he would ensure that his stepson rectifies \nthat debt. Applicant\u2019s current finances are sound. He has not incurred any new unpaid \ndebts, and he and his wife manage their finances together in a prudent manner. All of the \nforegoing supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 20(e). \n \nFinancial problems present a two-fold inquiry. First, does the ongoing presence of \nunpaid debt or other unresolved financial burdens present a likelihood that Applicant \nwould resort to illegal acts or other conduct that might compromise national interests? \nHere, that appears highly unlikely. Applicant has a reputation for reliability and \ntrustworthiness that tends to show he would not act counter to the national interest as a \nway of resolving his debts. Additionally, the manner in which he has responded to his \nfinancial problems is indicative of a willingness to resolve his debts and further manage \nhis finances through responsible and prudent measures. \n \n \nSecond, did Applicant\u2019s financial problems arise from irresponsible decisions, poor \njudgment, or other factors that indicate he is unreliable or untrustworthy? I conclude they \ndid not. Applicant is in the midst of resolving debts related to his 2015 marital separation. \nThat event did not arise through any misconduct or bad judgment by Applicant. The record \nas a whole establishes that those circumstances are unlikely to recur and that Applicant \nis now better equipped to manage his finances so they will not be a security concern in \nthe future. On balance, available information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s financial problems. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s job performance and \nreputation in the workplace. Additionally, his actions to resolve his debts evince a \nconscientiousness about his obligations and responsibilities that reflects well on his \nsuitability for continued access to classified information. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns about his financial problems. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n For Applicant \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Her admission to \nthe SOR allegation, and those at her hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She recently \ncompleted an associate\u2019s degree and is currently pursuing her bachelor\u2019s degree. \nApplicant married in 2004 and divorced in 2013. She has no children. \n \nApplicant worked as a personnel security specialist for a federal law enforcement \nagency between 2005 and 2012. She was unemployed between June 2012 and April \n2014. She worked for a federal contractor between April 2014 and February 2015, and \nwas unemployed between February and August 2015. She worked for a federal \ncontractor between August 2015 and March 2016. Her current employer, a federal \ncontractor, hired Applicant in March 2016 and is currently sponsoring the continuation of \nher clearance. She is a personnel security assistant. (Tr. 23) \n \nApplicant was first granted a clearance when she was a stay-in-school student \nworking for the federal agency in 1999. She did not remember the level of her first \nclearance, but stated that the DOD granted her a top-secret clearance in 2002, and \nsubsequently other agencies granted her secret clearances related to her duties. (GE 1) \n \nApplicant submitted a SCA in March 2010. (GE 7) She disclosed in her answers \nto Section 26 (Financial Record) that she had financial problems within the last seven \nyears, including: filing for bankruptcy in 2003; having a house (purchased in February \n2006) foreclosed in September 2008; and having delinquent debts in collection. \nApplicant explained that \u201cdue to the mortgage note being so high ($2,800 a month) my \nspouse and I had to walk. No financial companies would refinance the loan.\u201d She also \nexplained her Chapter 7 bankruptcy was discharged in 2003. She noted that she \ncurrently had some delinquent debts because her spouse has been unemployed since \nOctober 2009. (GE 7, Section 26) \n \nThe SOR concerns a single debt, a delinquent mortgage. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant \nclaimed she was delinquent in her mortgage payments because she was lied to during \nthe purchase of the house in 2016. She was told the mortgage payment would be \n$1,300, when in fact, the note payment was $1,600. She claimed she did not know \nanything about escrow funds or any additional expenses for insurance and taxes. She \ncould not afford the additional mortgage payments. She made two or three mortgage \npayments following the purchase of the house, and she then stopped paying the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmortgage in August 2016, because she had other living expenses to pay. Additionally, \nApplicant testified that she could not afford the mortgage payments because she \nprovided financial support to her mother in an as-needed basis and incurred financial \nexpenses related to the death of an unidentified family member. She provided no \ndocumentary evidence to support these last two claims. \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant admitted that she previously purchased a house in \n2006 that was foreclosed for lack of payments in 2008. She claimed that she did not \nlearn anything about escrow accounts from owning that property because the note \npayments were automatically drafted from her bank account. Applicant earns close to \n$21 an hour. Her monthly take home pay is about $2,500. She testified that she \nsubmitted several requests for a mortgage modification to the original creditor and to at \nleast two subsequent mortgage account holders. Her last modification request is \ncurrently pending with the most recent mortgage note holder. \n \nAlthough she is living in the house, Applicant has made no mortgage payments \nsince August 2016. During 2017, she took in a renter for a period of eight months to \nincrease her earnings to pay the mortgage. The renter paid her $850 a month, for a total \nof $6,800. Applicant claimed she saved $1,000 from the renter\u2019s income to pay her \nmortgage. She presented no documentary evidence of any mortgage payments made \nsince August 2016. She claimed that she used the rent income to pay other debts and \nold payday loans that she and her ex-husband incurred while married. \n \nApplicant testified that she has been talking to telecommunication service \nproviders, her home security service company, and other utility companies seeking to \nreduce the services she receives, or to cancel her service contracts, in an effort to \nreduce her expenses and be able to afford her mortgage payments. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence of these efforts.  \n \nApplicant noted that she purchased a 2018 car for about $23,000 in 2017, with a \nmonthly payment of about $600. After realizing she was having difficulty making the \nmonthly payments, she traded in the 2018 car for a 2007 luxury car that cost her \n$12,000, with a monthly payment of $316. (Tr. 32-36)  \n \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling. She averred she is \ncurrently following a budget, but provided no documentary evidence to support her \nclaim. She promised to take herself out of debt by concentrating on paying her \nmortgage first, and then addressing her remaining debts. She claimed she has been \nlooking for a second job to increase her earning since 2016. As of her hearing date, she \nhad not found any job opportunities. She promised to repair her credit and to be \nfinancially responsible in the future.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \nimplemented by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, which are effective June \n8, 2017, which are applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, \n2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. In June \n2016, she purchased a home beyond her financial means. She made the first three \npayments on the mortgage and stopped making them because she could not afford to \nmake the mortgage payments and to pay her living expenses. Although she has been \nliving in the house, since August 2016, she has made no more mortgage payments.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201d(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the above disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;2  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nNone of the financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the facts \nin this case. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nrecent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. Applicant claimed her 2013 divorce, \nproviding financial assistance to her mother, and the death of a relative are \ncircumstances beyond her control that likely contributed to her financial problems. Her \nevidence is insufficient to show that those factors contributed to or aggravated her \nfinancial situation. She purchased the property on her own three years after the divorce. \nShe presented little evidence to articulate the extent of her financial help to her mother, \nor how the death of a relative impacted her financial situation. Moreover, Applicant \nfailed to establish that she was financially responsible under the circumstances. \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling. She claimed she is \ncurrently following a budget, but failed to provide documentary evidence of a viable \nbudget. I find Applicant\u2019s efforts to pay her mortgage lacking. Particularly, when she \n                                            \n2 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \npurchased a 2018 car in 2017 above her financial means, and traded it in a couple of \nmonths for a 2007 luxury car to reduce her monthly payments from $600 to $316. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problem is not being resolved and her finances are not under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) are not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant should have been more diligent assessing her financial situation and \nher ability to pay her mortgage before she purchased the house. She claimed that she \nwas the victim of a misrepresentation by the seller. She averred she was told the \nmortgage payment would be $1,300, when in fact it was $1,600 after the addition of \nescrow monies (insurance and taxes). Applicant repeatedly claimed she did not know \nanything about escrow monies and that she miscalculated what she could afford. I find \nher claims of lack of knowledge not credible considering that she purchased another \nhouse in 2006, which was foreclosed in 2008 for lack of payments. Applicant stated that \nshe had to \u201cwalk\u201d of that house because she could not afford the payments. \n \n \nI note that Applicant has extensive experience working as a personnel security \nspecialist for federal agencies and federal contractors. Additionally, she has possessed \na clearance since 1999. Thus, Applicant is familiar with the security clearance process \nand with the security concerns raised by financial considerations. Her experience \nholding a clearance, submitting clearance applications, and working as a personnel \nsecurity specialist placed Applicant on notice that her financial problems created a \nsecurity concern. Considering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 41, has been employed with the Government and federal contractors, \nand has held a clearance since 1999. Her evidence is insufficient to demonstrate \nfinancial responsibility and she failed to mitigate the financial considerations concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \neligibility for a security clearance to Applicant.

(Item 1.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \neffective within the DoD after July 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 24, 2018. He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.) On \nJuly 11, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 6 Items, was mailed \nto Applicant on July 12, 2018, and received by him on August 1, 2018.  The FORM \n\n \n2 \n \nnotified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  \nApplicant failed to respond to the FORM.  DOHA assigned the case to me on December \n3, 2018.  Applicant had no objection to the Government\u2019s Items.  Accordingly, Items 1 \nthrough 6 are admitted into evidence and hereinafter are referred to as Government \nExhibits 1 through 6.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 38 years old.  He is divorced since 2011, and has four children.  It is \nunclear what position he holds with the defense contractor who has sponsored him for \nhis security clearance or when he was hired.  He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified thirteen debts totaling in excess of $39,000.  (Government \nExhibit 1.)  Applicant denies eight of the alleged accounts, which total approximately \n$1,670.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  Applicant states that these accounts, specifically \nsubparagaphs 1.h. through 1.m. are not his, but are his father\u2019s that have been mixed \nup in his credit report.  There has been no evidence presented by the Applicant that he \nhas disputed these debts on his credit report.  Applicant currently resides with his \nparents in their home since December 2010.     \n \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debt to a two year period of unemployment.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)  In his e-QIP, he lists two periods of unemployment from \nSeptember 2007 until January 2008, and May 2013 until when the application was \ncompleted in 2015.  The record is not clear as to when Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer.  Applicant failed to provide any documentation showing the current \nstatus of any of the debts alleged.  He also failed to provide any evidence to show that \nhe has contacted any of his creditors to set up payment plans or otherwise resolve the \ndebt.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated June 23, 2015; and February 20, 2018, \nconfirm that Applicant has not resolved any of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  \n(Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)   \n \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has done nothing to resolve his delinquent \ndebt.  There has been no evidence presented that demonstrates that Applicant has \ntaken any steps to resolve the debt by setting up payment plans or otherwise \ndemonstrate an established track record of debt resolution efforts.  Applicant states that \nhe has worked with an accountant to create a budget and plans to become debt-free  \nwithin the next 12 months and that he has not accrued any new debt in the last five \n\n \n3 \n \nyears.  The personal financial statement he submitted shows a $1,700 net monthly \nremainder after payment toward his child support accounts and those debts listed in \n1.c., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  He states that he is in the process of \nmaking arrangements to satisfy those debts listed in subparagraphs 1.c. through 1.g., \nbut failed to provide documentation to corroborate this.  No further details were \nprovided. The following debts listed in the SOR remain owing:  \n  \n(a) a debt for child support arrears in the amount of $16,928 remains delinquent. \nApplicant attributes his delinquent child support debt to a two year period of \nunemployment  \n \n \n(b)  a debt for child support arrears in the amount of $10,342 remains delinquent. \nApplicant attributes his delinquent child support debt to a two year period of \nunemployment.   \n \n \n(c)  a debt owed to a creditor was placed in collection in the approximate amount \nof $2,599.  The debt remains delinquent. \n   \n \n(d) a debt owed to a creditor was placed in collection in the approximate amount \nof $909.  The debt remains delinquent.    \n \n \n(e) a debt owed to a creditor for a medical bill was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $179.  The debt remains delinquent. \n \n \n(f) a debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$6,757.  The debt remains delinquent.   \n \n \n(g) a debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate amount of $431.  \nThe debt remains delinquent. \n \n \n(h) a debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the approximate amount \nof $300.  The debt remains delinquent. \n \n \n(i) a debt owed to a creditor was placed in collection in the approximate amount \nof $300.  The debt remains delinquent.    \n \n \n(j) a debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the approximate amount \nof $250.  The debt remains delinquent. \n \n \n(k) a debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the approximate amount \nof $100.  The debt remains delinquent.   \n \n \n(l) a debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the approximate amount \nof $55.  The debt remains delinquent. \n \n \n(m) a debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $55.  The debt remains delinquent. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThere is nothing in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his burden \nof proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under Guideline F.   \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant is delinquently indebted in excess of $39,000.  His actions \ndemonstrated both a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating condition under the Financial Considerations is \npotentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n  \nIt is unclear from the record how long the Applicant has been working with his \ncurrent employer.  What is clear, however, is the fact that he has not addressed his \n\n \n6 \n \ndelinquent debt in any form or fashion.  There is no evidence that he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.   His inaction is an action which casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

He stated that he recently contacted tax professionals to file his tax returns, \nand he would then pay the IRS what he owes.5 After considering all the evidence, I find \nthat Applicant did not intentionally provide false information on the SF 86. \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation in his response to the SOR that he retained \ntax professionals.

He stated that he paid the IRS $15,910 as payment in full for tax years 2009 \n                                                          \n1 Items 2-3. \n \n2 Items 1-3. \n \n3 Items 1, 3. \n \n4 Item 2. \n \n5 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \nand 2010. He also indicated that when the IRS determines how much he owes for 2011 \nthrough 2016, the tax professionals will arrange a payment plan with the IRS.6 \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling. He indicated that he has been \nforthcoming with his supervisors and leadership about his tax issues. He stated that he \nachieved every financial goal he set to address his tax problems. He is well regarded by \nthe military units he supports.7  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                          \n6 Item 1. \n \n7 Item 1. \n\n \n4 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant did not file his federal income tax returns when they were due for tax \nyears 2011 through 2016. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \ncondition.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in 2011. He was overwhelmed by the loss of his \nmother and the strain placed on him by his family over an inheritance. His wife also \ndeveloped cancer. He did not feel competent to prepare his 2011 federal income tax \nreturn. Rather than hire someone to assist him, he simply did not file federal income tax \nreturns for the next six years. The loss of his mother and his wife\u2019s cancer are tragic \nevents that were beyond his control, but he failed to act responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). This may be true even when the returns have been filed, as an applicant who \nbegins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on notice that his \nor her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own \ninterests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018). \n \n  \nThe tax returns have been filed, but Applicant still owes the IRS an indeterminate \namount. His tax issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) are partially applicable, and AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but they do not \ncompletely mitigate the judgment issues raised by Applicant\u2019s many years of shirking \nhis responsibility to file his tax returns and pay his taxes. I find that security concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances remain despite the presence of some mitigation.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about his tax returns on \nhis 2017 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \n\n \n7 \n \nmilitary service and that he is well regarded by the military units he supports. However, \nhe shirked his tax responsibilities for years, and he still owes the IRS an indeterminate \namount.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nerney Esq., The Edmunds Law Firm \n \n \nMarch 6, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 19, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-\n86). On May 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective \nwithin the DoD after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 19, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 5, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 7, 2018. The \nGovernment offered three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, \n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered twelve exhibits at the \nhearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through L, which were admitted without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record remained open until close of \nbusiness on December 31, 2018, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, \nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit M, which was admitted without objection.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 11, 2018. \n \n \n  \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe Peoples Republic of China (China) because it is inclusive of the territory of Hong \nKong.  Department Counsel provided an 11 page summary of the facts, supported by \n14 Government documents pertaining to China.  The documents provide elaboration \nand context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nU.S. Government reports. (HE I) They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He is married with one son. He has a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in Engineering.  He is employed with a defense contractor as a Senior \nManufacturing Engineer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with \nhis employment.    \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \nApplicant was born in China in 1962.  He grew up and completed elementary \nschool, before he and his family moved to Hong Kong in 1975.  He completed high \nschool in Hong Kong, and in the summer of 1986, he came to the United States.  During \nhis month long visit as a tourist, he was so impressed by the amicable people, the \nharmony of society, and the diversity of cultures, that he decided to pursue his college \neducation here.  He applied and was admitted to a University in 1987.  He obtained his \nBachelor\u2019s of Science degree in Engineering in 1990.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  While in \ncollege here, Applicant met his wife, and got married in 1989.  They have one son who \nis 18 years old, currently attending college, and studying engineering.  Applicant \nbecame a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1994.  (Tr. p. 22.)  Over the years, \nhe has established wealth, purchased a house, and has a retirement account and a \nnumber of investments in the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits J and K.) \n \nApplicant has worked for a number of employers over the years.  In March 2006, \nhe was offered a position with a defense contractor, and granted a security clearance in \nSeptember 2006.  Applicant worked there for ten years while holding a security \nclearance without incident.  During that time, Applicant received foreign travel briefings \nand understands the responsibilities involved with possessing a security clearance.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)  In January 2016, Applicant was highly recommended for a \n\n \n3 \n \nposition with another defense contractor by a longtime colleague of the company.  \nApplicant was subsequently hired, and has been working for the new company for the \npast three years.   \n \nApplicant has family that are citizens and residents of Hong Kong that include his \nmother, three brothers, and two sisters.  Applicant\u2019s mother has always been a \nhousewife.  She is not affiliated in any way with the Government of Hong Kong or the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.  Applicant communicates with his mother about her heath \nand his son about once a month.  They usually speak about twenty minutes.  She \nknows that Applicant is an engineer, but nothing more.  Applicant\u2019s mother last traveled \nto the United States to visit the Applicant in 2007.  (Tr. p. 26.)  Applicant last traveled to \nvisit his mother in Hong Kong in 2013.  (Tr. p. 27.)  While traveling to Hong Kong, \nApplicant has always used his United States Passport.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. \n37.)  Applicant has no future intentions to travel to Hong Kong.       \n \nApplicant has three brothers who are citizens of and residents of Hong Kong.  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s is a citizen of Britain, and resides in Hong Kong.  He is self- \nemployed as an interior designer.  (Tr. p. 29.)  He has never held a job or position with \nany foreign Government.  The other two brothers are citizens and residents of Hong \nKong.  One of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a banker, for a private bank.  The other brother is \nretired, and lives with their mother.  Prior to his retirement, he worked for a commercial \ntrading company, and is not affiliated, nor has ever been affiliated, in any way with the \nany foreign Government.  Applicant communicates with each of his brothers not more \nthan two to three times a year.   \n \nApplicant also has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Hong Kong.  One \nis a travel agent, the other is retired.  They are both married.  One of his sister\u2019s \nhusbands is a retired shoe salesman, and the other sister\u2019s husband is a private \nsecurity guard.  Neither husband has ever had any affiliation with the Hong Kong or \nChinese Government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is an American citizen who resides in the United States.  He \nand Applicant\u2019s mother are still married.  Applicant\u2019s mother prefers to live with one of \nher sons in Hong Kong than with her husband in the United States.  (Tr. p. 43.)   \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he cannot be coerced into divulging any national \nsecurity secrets.   He also believes that his limited relationships with any his family \nmembers in Hong Kong cannot be used to threaten him to do anything against the \ninterests of the United States.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Applicant has never been approached, \nconfronted, or contacted by any foreign entity attempting to obtain protected \ninformation.  In the event that this ever occurs, Applicant stated that he will immediately \ncontact the DoD security officer and report the incident.  (Tr. p. 46.)   \n \n \nApplicant prepared a notarized Statement of Intent dated October 1, 2018, which \nindicates that he will continue to have minimal or no foreign contacts outside of his \nofficial duties, and his family, and any conversations will remain strictly casual and \n\n \n4 \n \ninfrequent.  Any future communication with foreign contacts, (other than described \nabove) is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  (Government Exhibit E.) \n \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant during his prior employment and in his \ncurrent positon reflect favorable ratings.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.)  Applicant has received \na number of Certificates and Awards for accomplishments.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.) \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from professional colleagues of the Applicant, \nincluding his direct supervisor, collectively attest to his dedication and commitment to \nthe job, and he is described as one who excels in a fast paced potentially high stress, \nchanging environment, with an excellent ability to interface with multiply stakeholders, \nworks effectively in teams, and communicates with positive impact.  His excellent work \nproduct, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment is recognized by many.  He is \nconsidered a role model for integrity and honesty and is highly recommended for a \nsecurity clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n \n \nNotice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (China).   Targeting and collection of US political, military, \neconomic, and technical information by foreign intelligence services continues \nunabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information \nand technology.  China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other \nentities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China \nwho can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable \nmedia devices or e-mail.  Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent \nperpetrators of economic espionage.  Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological \nand economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and \npersistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve \nwith continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE I) \n \nI have also taken administrative notice of the following information concerning \nHong Kong.  Hong Kong is a presidential limited democracy and special administrative \nregion of the People\u2019s Republic of China with a population of over 7 million people.  As \na special administrative region, its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of \nChina.   However, Hong Kong is a customs territory and economic entity separate from \nChina and is able to enter into international agreements on its own behalf in \ncommercial, economic, and certain legal matters.  The United States and Hong Kong \nhave enjoyed a robust relationship, as stated in the U.S. \u2013 Hong Kong Policy Act of \n1992 and grounded in the determination to promote Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity, freedom \nand way of life.  The United States enjoys substantial economic ties with Hong Kong \nand U.S. companies generally have a favorable view of Hong Kong\u2019s business \nenvironment.  Hong Kong is an independent body from China, participates as a full \nmember of several international economic organizations such as The World Trade \nOrganization, Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and Financial Action Task \nForce.   The Government of Hong Kong generally respects human rights of residents \n\n \n5 \n \nand the law and judiciary generally provide an effective means of dealing with individual \ninstances of abuse.  The basic law in Hong Kong provides for the protection against \nhuman rights abuses.  There is freedom of speech, of the press, and of publication.  \nAdditionally, Hong Kong\u2019s basic law protects the citizen\u2019s freedom of expression, \nfreedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of movement.  Hong \nKong has also passed laws to combat discrimination and is clearly committed to liberty, \njustice, and fair treatment, of their citizens through an effective government framework. \nHong Kong is a global partner to the United States and shares much of the same \nhuman rights and economic views.  There are more than 1,300 U.S. firms in Hong Kong \nand approximately 85,000 American residents in Hong Kong.   (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n6 \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members are residents and citizens of Hong Kong.  \nApplicant maintains some contact with his family there.  Applicant\u2019s ties to his foreign \nfamily members in Hong Kong pose a heightened security risk for the United States \nGovernment.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and two of them are applicable in this case.   \n \n (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n \nFamily ties in a foreign country raises a prima facie security concern that \nrequired the applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation \nsufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a  security clearance for him.  Thus, Applicant bears the \nburden to establish that his relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  In this case, Applicant carefully explained that his family in \nHong Kong only knows that he is an engineer and nothing more about his job.  They \ndon\u2019t know where he works or what he does.  Their conversations are minimal, casual, \nand infrequent.  None of his foreign family members in Hong Kong are affiliated in any \nway with any foreign government.  It is recognized that Applicant is at a higher risk of \nbeing targeted for Chinese intelligence gathering since he works for a defense \ncontractor.  However, Applicant has held a security clearance for ten years from 2006 to \n2016, and has incurred no security violations nor has he had any problems of any sort.  \nThus, it can be assumed that he will continue to place the interest of the U.S. \nparamount, and always protect the U.S. from any risk of terrorism, and/or any situation \nthat could place the interests of the U.S. in jeopardy.  Under the circumstances, \nApplicant has met this burden and has established two mitigating conditions set forth \nabove under Guideline B.      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent man, who performs well at his job, and has the \nendorsement of his supervisor and professional colleagues.  It is noted that while he \nwas born in China, he is an American by choice. With his wife and son as his closest \nfamily ties, he has established his own life here in the United States.  He has also \nacquired significant assets, including a house, a retirement account, and a number of \ninvestments in the United States.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nJanuary 28, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn May 1, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP). \n(Government Exhibit 1.)  On May 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 5, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2018.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, 2018, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 3, 2018.  The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection.  She also testified on her \nown behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 11, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 57 years old.  She has been married and divorced twice.  She has a \nhigh school diploma and some college.  She holds the position of administrative \nassistant with a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with her employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.   \n  \nThe SOR identified four allegations under this guideline concerning Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file her Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016, \nand the fact that her wages were garnished by the state tax authorities for back taxes \nowed for tax years 2002 and 2016.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits each of \nthe allegations.  Applicant attributes her failure to file her income tax returns to \nprocrastination.     \n \n \nApplicant served in the United States Air Force for a year, seven months, and 13 \ndays, from 1980 until 1981.  (Tr. p. 23.)  Applicant claims that while in the military, she \nwas a woman working in a male-dominated mechanic profession and felt discriminated \nagainst.  She did not get along with her supervisor.  In lieu of a reprimand, she was \nadministratively separated from the Air Force prior to the end of her service contract and \nreceived an honorable discharge.  (Tr. p. 25.) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of tax problems, including late filings, delinquent back \ntaxes, and wage garnishments dating back at least twenty years.  (Government Exhibit \n3.)  Applicant has worked for her current employer since 2001.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  \n \n \nWhile married to her second husband from 1998 to 2004, Applicant states that \nshe first encountered tax problems.  In 2002, he filed their taxes and received a refund.  \nHe took an $8,000 deduction for a tool box because he was a mechanic that was not \nallowed by the IRS.  As a result, there was a tax liability.  He and Applicant divorced, \nand he was on disability and moved out of state.  In about January 2008, Applicant\u2019s \nwages were garnished to pay the taxes.  (Tr. pp. 16-17.)  \n \nIn regard to the other income tax returns that were not filed; namely Federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2013; 2014; 2015; 2016 and 2017, Applicant \nstates that she is a procrastinator.  (Tr. p. 32.)  She did not file these Federal and state \n\n \n3 \n \nincome tax returns on a timely basis because she was overwhelmed.  In 2010, she \nmoved in with her special needs daughter.  In order for the daughter to continue \nreceiving disability, Applicant had to complete the required paperwork and had several \ncourt dates.  Then, her father moved in with them, who also needed help being taken \ncare of.  Applicant knew that her income tax returns were due, but she kept putting them \noff.  Her daughter\u2019s father passed away in May of last year, and since then, she has \nbeen working on trying to get all of the taxes caught up.  At one point, Applicant \nrefinanced her house and has been having a hard time getting a hold of the mortgage \ninterest statements from the previous mortgage company.  (Tr. p. 32.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wages were most recently garnished by the state tax authorities in \nNovember 2016.  She stated that this garnishment was due to the denial of the rebate \nfor a solar system that she installed in her home.  She had not been advised until after \nthe system was installed that the state said that it did not meet the qualifications for the \nrebate.  She was left with $2,311.70 in taxes that she did not have the money to pay.  \nApplicant has paid the debt.  (Government Exhibit 2.) \n \n \nApplicant states that she is a very independent person and that she did not want \nto hire anyone to help her file her income tax returns until recently.  (Tr. p. 29.)  In \nSeptember of last year, she finally hired an accountant.  (Tr. p. 29.)  As of yet, Applicant \nhas not filed the income taxes in question and has not filed her most recent income tax \nreturns for tax year 2017.  (Tr. p. 34)   \n \nApplicant further states that she understands the importance of filing her income \ntax returns but that she was owed a refund and did not owe taxes.  When her income \ntax returns are eventually filed, she believes that she is due a refund of approximately \n$12,000.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d  The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n5 \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is possibly applicable in this case:   \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.  \n \n  \nApplicant is a procrastinator who has not filed her income tax returns on time \nsince 2013.  There is no excuse for this misconduct.  Applicant has not demonstrated \nthe high degree of judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required to hold a security \nclearance.       \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(e) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here.  Applicant states that she \nunderstands the importance of filing her income tax returns on time, but she has not \nbeen diligent and responsible enough to file them.  Instead, she has established a \npattern of failing to comply with Federal and state law that require her to do so.  \nApplicant has not demonstrated sufficient good judgment and reliability concerning \nthese tax issues and is clearly not eligible for access to classified information.   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant reports no military service and he has never married. Applicant reports previous employment in the information technology field and in the oil fields. He was terminated from a job in May 2015 for supposedly poor performance. He reports no previous security clearance. In January 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA),2 and in section 22 (Police Record), he disclosed a May 2013 arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI). However, he did not disclose any previous involvement with, or use of illegal drugs in section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity). In his July 2017 clearance interview, he volunteered his repeated use of various illegal drugs, to the investigator.3 Applicant stated that he had extensive use of various illegal controlled substances including cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, marijuana, Ritalin, Vicodin, and various pain pills. He started using cocaine as a senior in high school in 1998, and he continued to use it recreationally about once every six months, until 2002.

Applicant \ndid not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided a five-page response to \nthe FORM on September 7, 2018, with attachments (time-card entries from March to \nAugust 2018, Applicant\u2019s earnings statements from February to August 2018, a statement \nof intent, and a field bonuses - expenses document). (Response).  \n02/19/2019\n\n2 \n \nIn his Response, Applicant requested an additional 45 days to respond to the \nFORM to gather evidence. Department Counsel granted the extension. On October 25, \n2018, he submitted additional documentation comprised of a cover letter with a two-page \npsychologist\u2019s report of an alcohol and other substance use/abuse evaluation of \nApplicant. This has been marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s evidence, identified as Items 1 through 7, is admitted into \nevidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He graduated from high school in 1998, and has been \nemployed as a systems administrator by a federal contractor since January 2016. \nApplicant reports no military service and he has never married. Applicant reports previous \nemployment in the information technology field and in the oil fields. He was terminated \nfrom a job in May 2015 for supposedly poor performance. He reports no previous security \nclearance.   \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA),2 and \nin section 22 (Police Record), he disclosed a May 2013 arrest for driving while intoxicated \n(DWI). However, he did not disclose any previous involvement with, or use of illegal drugs \nin section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity). In his July 2017 clearance interview, \nhe volunteered his repeated use of various illegal drugs, to the investigator.3 Applicant \nstated that he had extensive use of various illegal controlled substances including \ncocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, marijuana, Ritalin, Vicodin, and various pain pills. He \nstarted using cocaine as a senior in high school in 1998, and he continued to use it \nrecreationally about once every six months, until 2002.  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant moved in with his girlfriend and his drug use intensified. \nTogether, they used a panoply of illegal drugs every weekend for three years, until they \nbroke up in 2005. Then, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use slowed down again to once every six \nmonths or so.4 He stated that he last used marijuana two years ago, and he last used un- \nprescribed pain killers in 2005. Applicant never purchased or sold illegal drugs. They were \nusually provided to him by friends in social settings. He stated he last used cocaine in \nApril 2017. He estimated he has driven under the influence of cocaine 12 to 16 times. \nApplicant initially stated that he did not intend to discontinue his recreational drug use \nunless it is required for his current employment.5 However, if he gets the job he has \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s January 19, 2016 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 3) and his summaries of clearance interviews by a background \ninvestigators dated July 2, 2017, and July 23, 2017. (Item 4).  \n \n2 Item 3.  \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 Item 4. \n5 Item 4, p. 9. \n \n\n3 \n \napplied for, he will not be using illegal drugs or alcohol because he will be deployed to \nKuwait, where they are unavailable.  \n \nIn his June 2018 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations \nincluding his illegal use of various drugs (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f) and testing positive on a drug \ntest administered by his employer in May 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) He clarified his admission to \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.h since he has started a new job in the oil fields that requires \nrandom drug testing and he quit using recreational drugs. In SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant \nadmitted to falsifying his responses in section 23 of his SCA, and termination from his \nemployment after testing positive on the May 2015 random drug test (SOR \u00b6 2.b) He also \nadmitted to three DWI arrests in 2000, 2006, and 2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c \u2013 2.e). The 2000 \ncase was dismissed, and the 2006 DWI was reduced to a lesser offense.  \n \nApplicant was evaluated for alcohol and other substance use/abuse on October \n18, 2018. The evaluating doctor found no evidence of any Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM 5) alcohol or substance use disorder. He did not find \nthat Applicant manifests features of either addiction or dependence. Applicant told the \nevaluator that he last used cocaine in February 2017. (AE A)  Applicant provided no \nevidence of character references or performance evaluations from his employer. He did \nprovide a statement of his unequivocal intent to not use illegal drugs after being granted \na security clearance and agreeing to automatic revocation of his security clearance if he \ndoes. (attachment D to Answer) He also provided time card and earnings documents \nreflecting that he earned approximately $21 per hour, and $31.50 per hour for overtime, \nin 2018. He routinely worked six or seven days a week on 12 hour shifts.      \n \n \n \n                                         Policies \n \n \nDOD took action in this case under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n\n4 \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n          The security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG  \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n\n5 \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n          The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \n \n \n                Applicant admitted he used marijuana and other illegal drugs for several years. He \nalso initially expressed an intent to continue using recreational in the future unless his \ncurrent employment prohibited such use. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \n \n \n           AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n           (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n           (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n     (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n                                                   \n \n             Applicant has continued to use cocaine as recently as February 2017 (AE A) or \nApril 2017 (Item 4). He started using cocaine recreationally in 1998. He was terminated \nfrom his employment in May 2015 for testing positive on a random drug test. Yet, he \ncontinued to use illegal drugs. He has not abstained and appears to be only willing to \nrefrain from illegal drug use, and comply with the law, if he obtains a security clearance. \nIn addition to marijuana, he used an assortment of other illegal or unprescribed drugs, \n\n6 \n \nincluding cocaine, pain pills, and Ritalin. He provided no evidence of completion of a \nsubstance abuse-course or rehabilitation.  \n \n \n         Applicant appears to be sincere in his efforts to abstain, but that is insufficient to \nmitigate the well-established pattern of illegal drug use. His conduct continues to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable, \nand AG \u00b6 26(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n           The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following normally will result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to \nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview, completing \nsecurity forms or releases, cooperation with medical or psychological \nevaluation, or polygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives \nin connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative;  \n\n7 \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single   \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-     \nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual  \nto the employer as a condition of employment. \n \n \nApplicant admitted to deliberately failing to disclose his illegal drug use on his 2016 \nSCA. However, he volunteered this information to an investigator at the outset of his \nclearance interview in early July 2017, before he was confronted with it. Moreover, he \ncredibly asserted in his Response to the FORM, that he felt rushed when he completed \nthe SCA. He had no specific intent to deliberately deceive the government.  AG \u00b6 16 (a) \nand (b) do not apply. Applicant admitted to three arrests for DWI in 2000, 2006, and 2013. \nThe first DWI was dismissed and the second resulted in conviction for a lesser offense. \nThe only arrest that resulted in a DWI conviction was his 2013 arrest. That conviction was \nover five years ago, but it still raises questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, when \nconsidered in conjunction with simultaneous and ongoing illegal drug use. He admitted to \ntermination by his employer for testing positive on a random drug test in violation of a \nrecorded commitment to his employer, in May 2015.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (c) and (f) are implicated \nand the focus shifts to a determination of which, if any of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n AG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns \nincluding: \n \n  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,               \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \nApplicant promptly corrected his omission of his illegal drug use in his SCA when \nhe broached it at the outset of his clearance interview. AG \u00b6 17 (a) applies to mitigate the \nallegation of falsification in SOR \u00b6 2.a. He did not deliberately intend to deceive the \n\n8 \n \ngovernment about his drug use. He claims to have completed a court-ordered substance \nabuse course and had counselling, but he produced no evidence. He has modified his \nbehavior and unequivocally expressed his intention to refrain from any illegal drug use in \nthe future in an attached statement to his Answer. He rarely drinks currently, and if he is \ndeployed to Kuwait, he will abstain completely.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c) and (d) apply partially, but \ninsufficient time has passed since Applicant was terminated from employment in 2015, \nand he last used cocaine in 2017, to safely conclude that he will not have a recurrence.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has worked six or seven days a \nweek, on 12-hour shifts, for a contractor. He has completed court-ordered DWI counseling \nand he has unequivocally declared his intention to refrain from further use of illegal drugs. \nNevertheless, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to assure me that he will \nremain sober and drug-free, since he failed to learn his lesson even after he was \nterminated, and he indulged in long-term illegal drug and alcohol use/abuse. Inadequate \ntime has elapsed to conclude that he will honor his commitment to change. He has not \nmet his burden of persuasion.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse remain a security concern. \nThese offenses were not minor or infrequent, and they were not committed under such \nunusual circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant has acknowledged the egregiousness of his drug involvement or \ntaken steps to alleviate the stressors or circumstances that contributed to his behavior to \ninsure that it does not recur. He has not met his burden of persuasion. The record \n\n9 \n \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guidelines H and E.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:              Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b through 2.e:              Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

However, Applicant identifies 2007 as a year that her ongoing financial \nproblems arose. Applicant graduated from college, and was employed by a state agency \nas a social worker. Applicant was passionate about her work, but due to her \ncompensation, she classifies the job as underemployment. That same year, Applicant \nunexpectedly gained custody of her friend\u2019s daughter, then 11 years old. Becoming a \nsudden parent of a young girl who was then experiencing emotional upheaval had a \nsignificant impact on Applicant\u2019s personal life. It also necessarily created additional strains \non Applicant\u2019s already-stretched finances, including counseling-related costs and \nunanticipated medical costs. Applicant and her husband divorced in 2010, and Applicant \nhas remained a single parent. (GX 3.)  \n \nFrom 2007 forward, Applicant struggled financially, with some periods being more \ndifficult than others. Applicant also stated that that she has not always made the best \nfinancial decisions. (Response; GX 3.) In 2016, she was also personally and financially \noverwhelmed by having to care for her father during his terminal illness, which resulted in \nmany hours of long-distance commuting and the associated costs, as well as causing her \nto leave graduate school before completing her coursework. (GX 3; GX 6.) \n \nAs a result of the onset of her financial difficulties, in 2007, Applicant was unable \nto timely pay her 2006 tax-year obligation. During her PSI in April 2017, Applicant stated \nthat she owed the IRS approximately $8,000, was repaying the debt annually by having \nher tax refund withheld and applied to her tax debts, and did not know when she would \n\n \n3\nsatisfy the debt. She further stated that although she owed an outstanding balance, she \nhad regularly filed her tax returns. (GX 5.)  \n \nApplicant provided a copy of a letter to the IRS from May 2017 in which she stated \nher intention to resolve any outstanding taxes, and requested information about the IRS\u2019s \nliens. However, the letter does not contain a mailing address, nor does it contain \nApplicant\u2019s Social Security number or other taxpayer identification information. In 2018, \nApplicant contacted the IRS and requested an installment agreement for unpaid taxes \nfrom 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2014. The IRS responded by letter, stating that it could not \nconsider an installment agreement because it had not received Applicant\u2019s return for \n2016. There is a handwritten notation by Applicant on the IRS\u2019s letter stating that the tax \nreturns have been filed, but she did not provide any corroborating evidence. (GX 5.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 23, 2018, IRS transcripts for tax years 2009 through 2017 show \nthat Applicant owes $15,983 in past-due taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 2008, \n2009, 2012, and 2014. The transcripts state that Applicant has not filed a return for 2010 \nor 2016, and there is simply no record relating to 2011 in the transcript. The transcript \nalso shows that Applicant filed her 2017 return on May 7, 2018, and indicates that \nApplicant had a $1,829 tax liability for 2017. (GX 5.) The 2010 $15,331 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) and \nthe $1,570 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) tax liens do not appear on the transcript, but remain unpaid \nas of April 2018. (GX 6.)  \n \nHowever, Applicant submitted pages 3 and 5 of a five-page document from the \nIRS to her regarding her 2016 tax return. Specifically, page 3 states that Applicant owes \nan additional $3,217 for her 2016 taxes. The document states that Applicant is required \nto pay this amount by August 6, 2018, to avoid penalties and interest charges. The \ndocument lists a failure-to-file penalty of $610 and shows that the IRS received the return \non September 15, 2017. (GX 3.) There is no evidence that Applicant paid the $3,217 of \npast-due taxes.  \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant does not deny the tax liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and \n1.n, but does dispute owing the amounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant stated that she \nreceived a letter from the IRS showing a different balance owed, but not showing the \nliens. She further stated that she contacted the IRS requesting a current amount due on \nthe liens. \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant made a $10 payment each on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.h, 1.l, and 1.k. In her Answer, Applicant stated that she had received repayment \noptions from the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.a in August 2018; that she was waiting to hear from \nthe creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.b about repayment options; that she was trying to find the original \ncreditor for the collection accounts for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i with the intent of entering into \nrepayment agreements; and that she was entering into a repayment agreement with the \ncreditors for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, and 1.r. There is no record evidence that Applicant \nentered any repayment agreements with any of these SOR creditors. Applicant admits \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d and has not taken any action on these debts. \n \n\n \n4\nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s through \n1.w with the three major credit reporting agencies. Applicant was told by a credit advisor \nto dispute the delinquent accounts in order to ascertain if the accounts were Applicant\u2019s \nand were accurately reported. (Response.) However, there is no record evidence that any \nof these debts were successfully disputed or removed from her credit reports. \n \nApplicant has created and maintains a budget worksheet, and uses a credit-\nmonitoring application on her cell phone. Her credit score has recently improved by 22 \npoints. (GX 3.) Applicant\u2019s April 2018 CBR shows no recently delinquent accounts. (GX \n6.) Applicant is active in her community, is a gubernatorial appointee, and has been \nofficially recognized for her advocacy for the underserved. She is dedicated to her job \nand to supporting the United States. Her daughter has recently earned a master\u2019s degree. \n(GX 3.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n5\n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3, \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d), \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to \nfile\u2026 or pay annual Federal\u2026 income tax as required.)  \n\n \n6\n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing financial difficulties arose in 2007, due to conditions largely \nbeyond her control. Specifically, she was underemployed and became the guardian of an \n11-year-old child with some emotional and health-related issues. Applicant fell behind on \nher financial obligations, and was unable to pay her 2006 taxes, which started a cycle of \nindebtedness to the IRS. The IRS entered tax liens against Applicant in 2010 and 2011. \nIn 2018, Applicant contacted the IRS in an effort to enter an installment agreement for all \nback taxes due for tax years 2008 through 2017. The IRS denied her request because \nthey had no record of her having filed her 2016 return. There is no documentary evidence \nthat Applicant has filed all required returns, or that she has reached any type of agreement \nwith the IRS. The known past-due taxes Applicant owes for tax years 2008 through 2015 \ntotal $15,983. Applicant has not filed her 2010 and 2011 tax returns. The total tax liability \nfor these years and for 2016 and 2017 is undetermined. Applicant has not satisfied the \n2010 and 2011 liens totaling $16,901. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.n, and 1.x are not mitigated. \n \nApplicant stated that she intended to enter repayment agreements with a number \nof her creditors. She made $10 payments to four separate SOR creditors in May 2018. \nShe also contacted several other creditors about repayment options, and, on the \nrecommendation of a credit advisor, disputed 10 of the delinquent accounts. However, \nshe has not taken any other action regarding the 21 delinquent SOR accounts which total \napproximately $19,000. \u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \n\n \n7\nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). While Applicant may have had a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of her delinquent accounts, there is no documented proof \nsubstantiating the basis of the dispute, nor is there any evidence that any of the delinquent \naccounts have been resolved through the dispute process. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l and 1.o through 1.w. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. Her failure to \ntimely file and pay her taxes as required by law and her failure to take reasonable action \nto resolve her financial obligations raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s willingness to abide \nby rules and regulations, and raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The financial considerations security concern is not mitigated \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2 were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \nApplicant has worked supporting the U.S. military for the past five years. She is \ndedicated to her job, her community, and her daughter. She is a recognized advocate for \nthe underserved members of her community and a gubernatorial appointee. However, \nuntil she can get her finances under control, her delinquent taxes and other debts remain \na concern. \n  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent taxes and other debts. \nAccordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \n\n \n8\nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.x:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 28, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 22, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February 20, 2019.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March \n14, 2019, scheduling the hearing for April 5, 2019. The hearing was rescheduled, with \nproper notice, for April 12, 2019. Initially, Applicant retained private counsel, but he \ndecided to represent himself. (Tr. 5) The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \nExhibits (AE) A though G, without objection. The record was left open until June 17, 2019, \nand Applicant timely submitted one document, which was marked as AE H, and was \naccepted into the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on April 26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 39, is single and has no children. He obtained his undergraduate \ndegree in 2005, and his master\u2019s degree in 2017. He served in the United States Army \nReserve from 1997 until 2005.  Applicant completed his security clearance application \n(SCA) on October 3, 2014. (GE 1)  He has worked for his current employer since May \n2018. He also owns and operates an IT company, which began in 2017. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1997. (GE.1) \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a through 1.c, that Applicant failed to timely file, as required, \nhis Federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016; that he \nfailed to timely file, as required, state income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, \nand 2015; and finally that he failed to timely pay, as required, his state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015. Applicant admitted the allegations but \nexplained that his failure to file or pay was due to a long-term overseas deployment in a \ncombat zone. \n \nApplicant attributed his tax problem to extraordinary circumstances. (Tr.16) He \nworked as a project manager for a contracting company abroad in conflict areas and war \nzones from November 2008 until May 2016.  He submitted letters of authorization to \nconfirm his claim. (Documents with Answer)  His trips home throughout the term of his \nemployment were brief and infrequent. He was home about twice a year for about a week. \nWhile Applicant worked for the same defense company from 2008 until 2016, he was on \nthe move to various conflict zones. (Tr. 61) However, in tax year 2016, Applicant was a \npart-time independent contractor abroad earning about $10,000, so he did not initially file \na tax return. (Tr. 30) He relied on the applicable tax code section and submitted a copy. \n(Tab D) Applicant returned to the United States permanently at the end of 2016. (Tr. 68)   \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2014 SCA he disclosed his difficulty in filing tax returns due to the \ntime it took to collect all necessary documents. Applicant explained that he self-filed \nFederal tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 and paid the tax due in September 2013. \n(Tr. 80) In 2013 he attempted to work with a tax preparer, but they stated the issue was \ntoo complex for them. (Tr. 32) In 2014, he hired a CPA to resolve the issues of filing while \nhe was deployed. (Tr. 32) For tax year 2015, he filed for an extension, then filed and paid \ntaxes within a timely manner. (Tr. 19. GE 2) During his 2015 investigative interview, he \nexplained the tax situation. (GE 2) \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, Applicant submitted tax transcripts from the IRS that show he filed \nhis Federal tax returns from 2011 to 2016 within the time allotted for someone who is \nworking in a combat zone. He presented tax transcripts that show the date filed and the \namount of tax he paid. He owes not tax for that period.  (AE, Tab D) He has filed his 2016 \nand 2017 Federal tax returns. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, and 1.c, Applicant stated that there was confusion as to which state \nhe owed taxes, and which state was his official residence while abroad. (Tr. 81) He \nbelieved because he had a driver\u2019s license from state A and had lived there prior to \ndeployment that it was his state of residence. His parents live in state B. State B contacted \nhis parents via telephone. (Tr. 81) He did not have a license in state B and did not believe \nit was his state of residence. He left state A and gave his mailing address as his parent\u2019s \nresidence.  (Tr. 96) Applicant learned about the state B tax issue and turned things over \nto a tax person. Although no one was certain that he really owed state B, he filed and paid \nall taxes for the years in question. (GE 3) Applicant stated that he and his tax agent are \nworking with the state treasury to resolve, if indeed, Applicant owed tax to state B. He \nnow believes he may owe state taxes to state A, but they are trying to resolve any issue. \nApplicant also believed after three years of living overseas, he gave up residence to state \nA. (Tr. 120) It is in the record that Department Counsel agreed to the confusion about \nowing taxes to state B. (Tr. 128) \n \n Applicant submitted various awards that he received while overseas and \ncertificates of appreciation. (Tab B). The vast majority of his professional career has been \nworking for DoD. It reflects an extraordinary career. \n \n Applicant submitted seven character letters, including one from his FSO, an \nenrolled tax agent, supervisor, colleagues and others who have known him for about 20 \nyears and served with him on deployments abroad. (AE Binder, Tab A). Each letter attests \nto his outstanding qualities and ability to handle classified information. One supervisor \nstated that Applicant has never violated security rules or regulations. (Tr. 48)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n4 \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his testimony, establish one disqualifying \ncondition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file of fraudulently file annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant admitted that some of his Federal and state taxes were not filed timely. \nHowever, he was deployed in a combat zone from 2008 to 2016. Several of his Federal \nreturns were timely. He obtained help from a CPA to file the Federal tax returns as he \nwas not home for a sufficient period of time to do so himself.  During two years, he was \nself-employed abroad. He relied on his understanding of the tax code. He had an \nextension for one year in 2015. He tried to file his Federal income tax returns as best he \ncould while he was deployed, even though he had the 180 day extension for working in a \ncombat zone for the years in question. He acted reasonably and responsibly. He provided \nthe IRS transcripts to show that all taxes were filed and paid. He does not expect to be in \na similar situation in the future. \n \nAs to state B taxes, there was confusion. Applicant believed that he was a resident \nof state A for the first few years of deployment. He did not believe since his parent\u2019s \nresidence was in state B that he owed state tax or had to file. When he learned of the \nsituation from his parents, he hired a tax agent and began to address the issue. Although \nhe was not certain that he owed those state taxes, he presented documentation that he \nhas filed and paid state B in full.  All mitigating conditions apply in the case.    \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his credibility and openness at the hearing, and his \nextraordinary career, Applicant had circumstances that occurred beyond his control and \nhe has acted reasonably and responsibly. He did not ignore the tax situation and \nattempted from the beginning to address the issues. In light of his many years of \ndeployment in a combat zone and his infrequent time in the United States he acted \nreasonably.  He even filed some Federal tax returns early despite his deployment in a \ncombat zone which allowed him 180 days extension. Since he was never back in the \nStates for a long period, when he returned to the combat zone his 180 days started again. \nAs to the state tax issue, there was confusion. However, he has filed and paid all taxes. \nHe has also filed all his Federal income tax returns and paid the taxes at time of filing. I \nam persuaded that Applicant\u2019s judgment is suitable.  Accordingly, Applicant has carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant has two charged-off \naccounts and one account placed for collection. The three delinquent accounts total \n$37,729. The debts remain unpaid and Applicant has stated he does not intend to pay \nthese delinquent obligations. He has not made sufficient progress toward resolving his \npast-due debts to continue his security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. \n \n \nThe DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n\n \n2 \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn September 14, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a decision on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On October 10, 2018, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of five exhibits (Items 1-5). \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within \n30 days of receipt. No response has been received. On March 6, 2019, I was assigned \nthe case to determine whether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4, a Response to DOHA Interrogatory, \nsubscribed and sworn by Applicant on July 11, 2018. Included with the Response was \nthe Adoption of Summary of Personal Subject Interview conducted on October 20, 2017. \nThe summary was part of the DoD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DoD personnel background report of investigation \nmay be received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it \nis otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The interview summary did \nnot bear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to \nit; and there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this \ncase, Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to \nsubmit objections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the \nlegal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process \nrights or protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. \nHe was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nhe was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive \ndoes not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was \nplaced on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview \nsummary, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, \nor updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not object to the FORM or \nindicate that the Personal Subject Interview contained inaccurate information. \n  \nApplicant, who holds a master\u2019s degree, can reasonably be held to have \nunderstood his obligation to object to the PSI or indicate that it contained inaccurate \n\n \n3 \ninformation. Accordingly, I accepted Item 4 in the record, subject to issues of relevance \nand materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that, as of October 10, 2018, Applicant had three delinquent \nobligations which together totaled $37,729. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted, with \nexplanation, the delinquent obligations listed in SOR 1.a ($12,042), SOR 1.b ($3,687), \nand SOR 1.c ($22,000). He stated he had no intention of paying the first two obligations, \nbut was in litigation over the loan listed in SOR 1.c.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and his response \nto the SOR (Item 1), I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior architect who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince December 2015. (Item 3) He seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Item 3) He is \nnot married. In June 1997, he obtained a master\u2019s degree. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2017 subject interview, he asserted his current financial \nsituation was favorable and that his credit score was 800. (Item 4) He stated he owned a \nbar in partnership with two partners. There came a point in the partnership where the \nother partners locked Applicant out of the business. He believes the other partners want \nhim as a minority business partner because the others could not obtain credit. (Item 4) \nHe was 20 percent owner of the business. (Item 4) He believes the debts were beyond \nhis control since he was locked out of the business. (Item 5)  \n \nThe personal credit card listed in SOR 1.a was used by Applicant to make business \npurchases. He believes it went delinquent in August 2009. No efforts to pay this debt have \nbeen made and he has no intention of paying the debt. Once he was locked out, he \nreferred all calls and letters from the creditor to the business. (Item 5)  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s February 1, 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he indicated, as to the personal credit card debt in SOR 1.a, \u201cThis \nwas a bill from the small business. When I was kicked out of my business by my partner \nI lost my business and my income/ability to even personally pay for the debt.\u201d (Item 3)  \n \nThe accounts in SOR 1.a and 1.b were opened in July 2007. (Item 5) The obligation \nin SOR 1.b was a $3,500 line of credit opened in his name and used to buy an ice machine \nfor the bar. He has no intention of paying the debt. (Item 4) Regarding the delinquent \nobligation he stated in his e-QIP: \n \nMuch like [the SOR 1.a credit card obligation] this bill was being paid by my \nsmall business for a year and then when the conflict occurred with my \nbusiness partner[s] they kicked me out of the business. I was never \n\n \n4 \ncompensated for the hit to my credit. I also did not spend the money for \npersonal use. It was all used on the business which agreed to keep paying \noff the debt. (Item 3)  \n \n \nApplicant explained on his e-QIP the delinquent obligation (SOR 1.b) had been \nsetup as a business account. After he was physically locked out of the business he \ncontinued making payment for a period of time, but stopped when he pursued legal action. \n(Item 3) He stated that he was responsible for the obligation, but he never thought the \nline of credit would be used by the business and not paid. (Item 3) In a legal action the \ncourt ruled in favor of the bank and against Applicant. (Item 3) The debt remains \nunsatisfied. \n \n \nThe obligation in SOR 1.c ($22,000) was a Small Business Administration (SBA) \nloan. Applicant and one of his partners were the guarantors on the $50,000 loan. In 2015, \nthe loan went into default. In March 2015, he began receiving calls demanding payment \nfrom the credit union holding the note. Applicant hired an attorney to assist him in the \nmatter. (Item 4) Applicant claims, without additional documentation, that he is no longer \nresponsible for the debt. He submitted, with his SOR response, page two of an \nunidentified document signed by Applicant\u2019s attorney and the attorney for his co-\nguarantor. (Item 2) The page is dated April 14, 2011. The date on the page appears to be \n\u201c4/14/2011,\u201d which would have been before the default.  It is possible that the date of the \ndocument was actually April 14, 2017. (Item 2) The page states, \u201c6. Defendants agree to \nindemnify Plaintiff [Applicant] with regard to the Small Business Administration loan \nexecuted by Plaintiff;\u201d (Item 2) \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant was informed by the IRS that his anticipated $5,500 federal \ntax refund had been intercepted and applied to the delinquent loan, and that all of his \nfuture federal tax refunds would also be intercepted until the loan was paid in full. (Item \n4) In October 2018, he received a letter from the Department of the Treasury requesting \npayment of the $22,000 loan balance. (Item 4) In his October 2018 interview, he said he \nwas willing to pay the SBA loans to the degree advised by his attorney. He has provided \nno documentation showing payment. \nExcept for the delinquent obligations listed in SOR 1.a and 1.b, the other 23 \naccounts listed on Applicant\u2019s February 2016 credit report are listed as \u201cPays As Agreed.\u201d \n(Item 5) He attributed his financial problems to being immature at the time he entered into \nthe business partnership. He stated there would not be a recurrence of the event because \nhe will never involve himself with business partners again. (Item 5) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n5 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n6 \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nThe concern under financial considerations is broader than the possibility that an \napplicant might knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. An applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances are relevant in \nassessing his or her self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the \nnational secrets as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. Behaving \nresponsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person \nmay behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has three delinquent obligations which total $27,729. He used a personal \ncredit card to buy supplies for his business. He used a line of credit to buy an ice machine \nfor the business and he signed as a guarantor for a SBA loan. AG \u00b6 19 includes thee \ndisqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern, any may be disqualifying in \nthis case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of \nthe ability to do so;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \nSecurity concerns having been raised, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. September 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n\n \n7 \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred three debts related to a business partnership. Two personal \ncredit card accounts became delinquent in about 2009, and a SBA loan went into default \nin 2015. Although used for business purposes, each debt was incurred by Applicant \npersonally and not by the business. He is personally liable on each debt. He failed to \nprovide sufficient documentation that he is taking responsible action to resolve these \ndebts after being locked out of the business.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has limited applicability. Applicant had three debts which indicates his \ndelinquent obligations were few. He stated he was immature when he entered into the \nbusiness partnership and does not intend to enter into another partnership. The business \nobligations are unlikely to recur. But the debts remain unpaid and he has stated he does \nnot intend to pay the delinquent obligations. As such, the delinquent obligations cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply.  \n \n\n \n8 \nBeing locked out of his business is an event beyond Applicant\u2019s control, but for AG \n\u00b6 20(b) to apply he must act responsibly under the facts. One reasonable course of action \nafter being locked out would be to bring a civil suit against the other partners. The only \ndocumentation provided by him showed a lawsuit was possibly filed, however, the context \nof the document is not part of the record. The title of the document is unknown. The \nparticular page presented appeared to have the signature of the defendants and that of \nApplicant\u2019s attorney and bears the date of \u201c4/14/2011.\u201d The actual date of the document \nmight not be 2011 but 2017. The copy is unclear. There is no indication the court saw or \napproved the document.  \n \nThe single page of the document indicates the defendants would indemnify \nApplicant as to the SBA loan. There is no evidence defendants have done so. The record \nshows the IRS intercepted his tax refund and intends to continue intercepting his tax \nrefunds until the SBA loan default is paid. The record fails to support Applicant has acted \nreasonably under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nThere is no showing Applicant has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source. During his background interview, he \nasserted he has a favorable credit score, but he failed to provide a document supporting \nthat assertion. His February 2016 credit report showed two delinquent accounts and the \nother 23 accounts were showing as being paid as agreed. That credit report shows the \nstatus of his credit more than three years ago. No documents were presented showing \nhis current credit report or his current financial picture. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He has \nmade no payments on the delinquent obligations and does not intend to do so. The \nmitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has noted under the financial considerations guideline \nthat an applicant should demonstrate a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of payments that shows \noverall debt reduction. Though Applicant is not required to demonstrate he has paid off \nall debts listed in the SOR, he should show that he has a plan to repay the delinquent \ndebts and has taken consistent steps to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20(e) to apply there must be more than simply denying responsibility for \nthe delinquent obligation. The individual must have a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem. Additionally, he must \nprovide documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue. Applicant has provided insufficient documentation. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n9 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant is a 42-year-\nold senior architect who has worked for a defense contractor since December 2015. He \nwas put on notice of the government\u2019s concern about his finances during his October \n2017 interview, when the August 2018 SOR was issued, and when he received the \nOctober 2018 FORM. No payments have been made on his delinquent obligations.  \n \nApplicant elected to have a decision based upon the written record, and then did \nnot respond to the government\u2019s file of relevant material. Applicant has provided \ninsufficient persuasive evidence to rebut the financial concerns specified in the SOR. It is \nreasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution or \nsatisfaction of specific debts. Applicant has legal repayment obligations that remain \nunresolved. The delinquent obligations have not been paid and Applicant does not intend \nto pay them. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). \n \nIn requesting an administrative determination, Applicant chose to rely on the \nwritten record. In so doing, however, he failed to submit sufficient information or evidence \nto supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his circumstances, \narticulate his position, and mitigate the financial security concerns. He failed to offer \nevidence of financial counseling or provide documentation regarding his past efforts to \naddress his delinquent debt. By failing to provide such information, and in relying on his \nthree paragraphs of response to the SOR and page \u201ctwo\u201d of an untitled document, \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \n\n \n10 \nwhole person. The issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been \npaid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Clearance is granted.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIn an undated answer, Applicant denied the allegations and requested a hearing. On \nNovember 21, 2018, Department Counsel amended the SOR , adding a paragraph, \nalleging Guideline E, personal conduct, amending subparagraph 1.b by making it \nsubparagraph 2.a, and cross-alleging 1.a as subparagraph 2.b to include the alleged \n \n\n2 \n \nmisconduct under the personal conduct guideline.  \n \nOn January 16, 2019, the case was assigned to me, after having been transferred \nfrom another administrative judge. On February 12, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for March 11, 2019. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I received four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4), \nfour Applicant exhibits (AE A - AE D), and a copy of the discovery letter from Department \nCounsel to Applicant, dated November 21, 2018. Also, I considered the testimony of \nApplicant and three character witnesses. Another witness who was at the hearing and \nprepared to testify had to leave early, prompting Applicant\u2019s counsel to request that the \nrecord be kept open for a week to submit a character letter. Department Counsel did not \nobject, and I left the record open. Within the time allotted, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a \nreference letter from the witness who had to leave the hearing early, and I incorporated the \nletter into the record as AE E. The transcript was received on March 27, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old single woman. Since 2012, she has worked as a security \nassistant for various federal contractors. (GE 1 at 9-24) According to her current \nsupervisor, with whom she has worked since July 2016, she is a conscientious worker who \ncomes to work on time and on a regular basis. Moreover, her integrity is \u201cbeyond \nreproach,\u201d and she has the strongest work ethic of any of his subordinates. (Tr. 52-53) A \nformer coworker characterized Applicant as \u201ca very professional, funny, caring, and \nconscious professional,\u201d who was well-liked by the team, and who always ensured that \neach member of the team participated in each team-building activity. (Answer at 6)  \nAnother coworker, who worked with Applicant from approximately July 2016 to July 2018, \ncharacterized her as \u201cdependable, real self-motivated, and loyal.\u201d (Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2012. (GE 1 at 41) It was suspended \nin 2016, pending the outcome of this security clearance decision. (GE 3 at 2) \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.a alleges that in December 2015, during an interview with a \npanel of employees from a contracting firm, Applicant disclosed that she kept access code \ncombinations written down on a piece of paper in her possession while working for her \nthen-employer, between October and November 2015, and that she verbally disclosed \naccess code combinations. Applicant acknowledges that she underwent an interview in \nDecember 2015, and that she discussed the security procedure for opening the Sensitive \nCompartmented Information Facility (SCIF) where she was then working. (Tr. 24) However, \nshe denies that she either failed to follow security procedures when she worked in the \nSCIF, or that she disclosed access combinations during the interview. Specifically, she \ntestified that the SCIF where she worked could be entered with security cards. Before the \nsecurity cards could operate, the agency\u2019s security specialist,1 as the first person who \narrived each morning, had to open it by unlocking each of the three successive doors that \nled to the SCIF. (Tr. 37) After this task was performed, the SCIF was accessible by security \ncards for the remainder of the day. (Tr. 39-40) \n                                                 \n1 Applicant was working onsite at a federal government agency. (Answer at 7) \n\n3 \n \n \n \nOne day, the security specialist asked Applicant to open the SCIF the following \nmorning. He issued Applicant the code to a secured cabinet, which Applicant used to open \nthe cabinet lock and retrieve an envelope with three combinations enclosed for the \nsuccessive doors. (Tr. 25) To aid her memory, Applicant wrote the combinations to the \nsuccessive doors on a sheet of paper. (GE 4 at 3) After opening each successive door and \ngetting to her desk, which was located in the SCIF, she tore up the paper and placed it in \nher burn bag. (Tr. 46) The paper that contained the combinations was never out of \nApplicant\u2019s possession when she was referring to it to open the combinations. (Tr. 25) \n \n \nApplicant never performed morning SCIF-opening duty again. (Tr. 25) There is \nconflicting record information concerning whether writing down security access codes \nconstituted a security infraction.  She contends that writing down the codes for the security \ndoors, then tearing them up and disposing them in a burn bag was not a security infraction. \n(Tr. 32) A character witness testified that it constituted a security infraction to write down a \ncombination to a classified cabinet. (Tr. 67)  There is no record evidence of a company rule \nor procedure that addresses this issue.  \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.b alleges that Applicant told the interview panel at the \nDecember 2015 interview, that she hears voices in her head. Applicant denies this \nallegation. (Answer; Tr. 29) She has never heard imaginary voices or been diagnosed with \na psychiatric condition, nor has she ever sought treatment or been hospitalized for a \npsychiatric condition. (Tr. 29) After Applicant learned of the allegation set forth in \nsubparagraph 1.b, she contacted the head of the panel that interviewed her in 2015. The \npanel chairwoman denied making this allegation. (GE 4 at 3) \n \n \n \nApplicant has been receiving medical services from a primary care provider since \n2012. (Tr. 30) According to a nurse practitioner from the practice, Applicant is not being \ntreated for any psychiatric conditions. (AE D) Per a friend who has known Applicant for 20 \nyears, she has never displayed any symptoms of a psychiatric condition. (Tr. 57) Similarly, \na coworker who worked with Applicant in 2012 noticed no symptoms indicative of a \npsychiatric condition. (Tr. 64) \n \n \nThe allegations that form the basis of the SOR were reported to the Defense \nSecurity Service (DSS) by the facility security officer of the company where Applicant \ninterviewed, on December 21, 2015, three days after the interview occurred. (GE 3) On \nMarch 15, 2016, DSS suspended Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (GE 3 at 2)  \n \n \nThe DSS report does not identify the individuals who made the adverse statements. \nIt also incorrectly states Applicant\u2019s place of employment at the time of the interview. (Tr. \n19)  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                 \n2 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n\n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concerns about handing protected information are set forth in AG \u00b6 13: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information \u2013 raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nApplicant wrote access code combinations on a piece of paper, which she used to \naid her memory, as she opened three doors to a SCIF, on one occasion seven years ago, \nwhile working for a former employer. Her recollection of whether writing down a \ncombination to a classified safe constitutes a security infraction conflicted with the \nrecollection of a former coworker, who testified that such conduct would constitute a \nsecurity infraction. However, there is no record evidence of an express company rule or \nprocedure rule prohibiting this conduct. Absent record evidence of such a rule or \nprocedure, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct does not constitute a mishandling of \nprotected information. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that Applicant\u2019s conduct \nconstituted a security infraction, triggering AG \u00b6 34(g),3 the length of time since it elapsed, \nand its isolated nature, trigger the application of AG \u00b6 35(a).4 \n  \n \nThe allegation that Applicant disclosed the access codes at an interview is based on \nGE 2, a DSS Suspicious Contact Report. No one is identified in the report.  The probative \nvalue of the report is further limited as it contains the wrong city for where Applicant was \nworking when the 2012 episode with the security access codes occurred. Upon weighing \nthis report against Applicant\u2019s denial and the positive record evidence of her integrity \u2013 \nparticularly, the character reference of her current supervisor - I conclude that the \nallegation that Applicant disclosed the access codes at her interview is unsubstantiated. In \nsum, I conclude that there are no Guideline K security concerns. \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n3 Any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive information. \n \n4 So much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n\n6 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s conduct, as cross-alleged In SOR subparagraphs 1.a \nand 2.b, was unsubstantiated. Consequently, it generates no security concern under either \nthe guideline governing the mishandling of protected information, or the personal conduct \nguideline. \n \n  \nThe allegation that Applicant hears imaginary voices, if true, would trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 16(d)(1), \u201cuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . .\u201d, and AG \u00b6 16(e), \n\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other \nindividual or group.\u201d Applicant denies this allegation. The credibility of her denial is \nbolstered by the record evidence of her good job performance and strong character. \n \n \nThe allegation that Applicant disclosed hearing imaginary voices to an interview \npanel is encapsulated in a DSS report that neither identifies the members of the interview \npanel, nor indicates which of the members of the interview panel made the allegation. The \nonly member of the interview panel identified in the record denied making this allegation \nwhen contacted by Applicant. The DSS report also misstates Applicant\u2019s place of \nemployment when the interview occurred. Upon weighing this adverse information report \nagainst the positive record evidence, I conclude that the SOR allegations contained within \nit are unsubstantiated. There are no personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s credibility, I considered her strong work ethic, sterling \nreputation, and integrity.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n` \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the concerns raised by her continued marijuana use \nand delinquent debt. She did not intentionally falsify her Public Trust Position \nApplications. Based on a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility \nfor a position of trust is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guidelines H, F, and E.  (Item 1.) The action was taken under DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 20, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. (Item 1.) Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on July 18, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas sent to Applicant, including documents identified as Items 1 through 10. She was \n   12/17/2018\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ngiven an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on July 25, 2018, and did not \nrespond. Items 1 through 10 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me \non December 10, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, 2.a through 2.o, \n2.q through 2.t, and 3.a, with explanations. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.p, and 3.b through 3.e. \n(Item 1.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1997. She listed on \nher April 2016 electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) that she \nhas been employed in her present position since May 2001. She occupies a position of \ntrust. She was married to her first husband from June 1996 to February 2009. She married \nher second husband in 2010, and has three children and one stepchild. (Item 2; Item 3; \nItem 4.) \n \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s April 2016 e-QIP, she indicated: \u201cI experimented with several \ndifferent drugs in high school, but the only one that I continued to do beyond high school \nwas marijuana and there were stretches of years (including my first marriage) when I did \nnot do it out of respect for those around me who do not smoke.\u201d (Item 4.) She estimated \nthe dates of use to be June 1991 through April 2016. She further checked the box that \nindicated she intended to engage in this activity in the future and indicated that \u201cwhile \nthere are no specific plans of continuing [to use marijuana], there are also no specific \nplans of avoiding it, either.\u201d (Item 4.)  \n \n \nDuring her subject interview conducted on May 23, 2017, Applicant discussed her \ndrug use in detail. (Item 5.) She indicated that she used and purchased marijuana at \nvarying frequencies since 1991. At the time of the interview, she used marijuana on a \nweekly basis. She used marijuana with her husband and friends. She disclosed that \nbetween 1991 and 1994 she used cocaine once, LSD three times, and amphetamines at \nvarying frequencies. (Item 5.)  \n \n \nApplicant completed Public Trust Position Applications in July 2003 and March \n2005. Questions 21(a) and 21(b) on those forms asked Applicant if she had used any \ncontrolled substance within the last year and whether in the past seven years she had \nbeen involved in the illegal purchase of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, \nor cannabis. She answered all of these questions no. She claimed in her answer to the \nSOR that between March 1994 and May 2008, she did not use or purchase any controlled \nsubstance to include marijuana. Her claim is credible, as she consistently indicated that \nshe did not use marijuana during the course of her first marriage, which corresponds with \nthe dates of her Public Trust Position Applications. (Items 2-5.)  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was also alleged to be indebted on 19 delinquent accounts totaling \n$34,656, and to have discharged debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2004. These \ndebts and the bankruptcy filing were established in the bankruptcy petition and the credit \nreports dated May 6, 2005, June 9, 2016, and July 16, 2018. (Items 7-10.) She attributed \nher debts to her divorce, the need for emergency medical care, and underemployment. \n(Item 5.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, filed in March 2004, she listed assets \ntotaling $16,053 and liabilities of $64,500. All of her liabilities were unsecured claims. \nThey were discharged in June 2004. (Item 10.)  \n \n \nOf her alleged delinquent debts, a total of $10,102 related to unresolved medical \naccounts, as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.g through 1.o, 1.q, and 1.s. In her \nanswer, she indicated, \u201cI admit that I have many medical bills and am actively making \npayments every month to pay them off. I do not know which of these debts is legitimate \nand/or still outstanding.\u201d She provided nothing further in this regard. Her July 2018 credit \nreport listed four delinquent medical accounts, which correspond with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, \n1.m, and 1.n. It is unclear if the other medical debts alleged were resolved through \npayment or if they are no longer reported on the credit report due to their age. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.d, 1.g through 1.o, 1.q, and 1.s are unresolved. (Items 8, 9.) \n \n \nApplicant also had four non-medical debts identified on the SOR. She was alleged \nto be delinquent in the amount of $3,707 for a judgment against her by a bank, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e. She satisfied this judgment in January 2013, as reflected on her July 2016 \ncredit report. She was also alleged to be indebted on a judgment obtained by a utility \ncompany in the amount of $658 as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.f. She satisfied this judgment in \nFebruary 2011, as reflected on her July 2016 credit report. These debts are resolved. \n(Item 8.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleged Applicant was indebted on a repossessed automobile in the \namount of $16,873. This debt became delinquent in January 2010. Applicant denied this \ndebt. She indicated that this debt was incurred by her ex-husband without her knowledge \nor permission. \u201cAs soon as [she] discovered the purchase had been made, [she] left him. \nIn [their] divorce papers, this is the date of [their] separation.\u201d Applicant presented no \nevidence establishing that she contested this debt with the creditor or credit reporting \nagency. This debt is unresolved. (Item 8.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r alleged Applicant was indebted to a bank in the amount of $3,316. The \ndebt was reported as delinquent in October 2014. She admitted this debt and claimed to \nhave set up a payment agreement with this creditor. She provided no documentation of \nthat agreement or of any payments made to this creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Items \n5, 8.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \n \n \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying. The following conditions are \nestablished: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nAppellant smoked marijuana at varying frequencies from 1991 to present. She \npurchased it for her own use and shared it with friends and her current husband. She also \nused LSD, cocaine, and amphetamines at varying frequencies between 1991 and 1994. \nShe continued to use marijuana despite occupying a position of trust since 2001, and \nindicated an intent to continue its use. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(f), and 25(g) are \nestablished.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant indicated her intent to use marijuana in the future. She uses it with her \nhusband and current associates. She has not presented sufficient evidence to support \nany of the mitigating conditions. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nBeginning around 2004, Applicant accumulated delinquent debt that she has been \nunable to fully resolve. She discharged liabilities of $64,500 through Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin June 2004. However, she continued to accrue additional delinquent debt. The majority \nof her 19 delinquent accounts remain unresolved. The evidence raises the above \ntrustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial problems: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to establish that she is addressing the \nremaining 17 delinquent accounts. While there is evidence that \u00b6 1.e and 1.f were \nresolved in good faith, there is no evidence that her other debts were repaid or \notherwise resolved in good faith. She provided no evidence to suggest that future \ndelinquencies are unlikely. Her debts are partially attributable to circumstances \nbeyond her control like emergency medical care and her divorce, but she has not \ndemonstrated reasonable and responsible action to address them, despite being \nfully employed since 2001. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of her e-QIP and drug use, the \nfollowing disqualifying condition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant was truthful on her 2003 and 2005 Public Trust Position Applications. \nShe has consistently stated that she did not use marijuana during the course of her first \nmarriage, out of respect for her husband who did not use it. The dates of her first marriage \ncorrespond with the reporting timeframes of one and seven years for drug use and \npurchase. She honestly answered the questions about her past drug use by stating \u201cno\u201d \non those forms. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \n \n  \nApplicant continues to purchase and use marijuana. As a result, she is vulnerable \nto exploitation, manipulation, and duress. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(e).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns. I \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion. She produced no evidence of counseling \nor positive steps that would alleviate the risks present from her conduct. Her decision to \ncontinue to use marijuana demonstrated questionable judgment. None of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 42 years old, and \nhas a long history of marijuana use and financial difficulties. She intends to continue using \nmarijuana, which casts doubt on her judgment and ability to follow rules and regulations. \nAdditionally, Applicant has not established a track record of resolving delinquent debts \nand achieving financial solvency. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, eligibility, and suitability for a position of trust.

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n04/15/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case alleges security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 23, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 3, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nFebruary 11, 2019, scheduling the hearing for March 1, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Applicant\u2019s counsel withdrew from the case and Applicant represented \nhimself. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A though K. \n\n \n2 \n \nThe record was left open until April 1, 2019, and Applicant timely submitted a packet of \nsix documents, which was marked as AE L, and was accepted into the record without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 50, is married with two children. He obtained his undergraduate \ndegree in electrical engineering in 1995. Applicant completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA) on August 11, 2017. (GE 1)  He has worked for his current employer \nfor a little more than two years. He has a real estate license and has taken other \ncertification courses. (Tr.27) \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a through 1.e, five delinquent debts totaling about $38,000, \nwhich include a first and second mortgage, a real estate course, and a credit account. \n(GE 2, 6) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations for each \none. (Answer) He noted that he had paid the debt in SOR allegation 1.d, and provided \ndocumentation. \n \nFINANCIAL \n \nApplicant acknowledged his financial hardship, and explained that the financial \nproblems started when his home in state A was rented for about seven years with no \nproblems at first. Applicant and his wife moved from that home in 2009 and relocated to \nstate B for jobs. Applicant was unemployed for seven or eight months in 2009. The renter \ncaused massive damage to the home in state A and Applicant eventually evicted the \ntenant. (GE 1) The renter was also about $2,000-$3,000 behind in rent payments. \nApplicant obtained a judgment against the tenant but has not received any money. (Tr.13) \nHe recounted the expense this caused him in terms of fixing the damage and various \nfines that he received from the state. In addition, he incurred legal fees. He approximates \nthat he spent over $20,000, not counting the citations from the state and legal fees.  (AE \nA-K) He borrowed from his 401(k) to pay for the repairs. (Tr. 14) \n \nApplicant hired an attorney to dispute the state citations in state A. This is ongoing. \nThe home is now repaired, but the rent is not sufficient to cover the first or second \nmortgage on the home in state A. Applicant attempted a loan modification but that was \nnot successful.  He is now in the process of attempting a short sale. Applicant credibly \ntestified that until the fiasco with the renter, he never missed a mortgage payment. (Tr. \n17) His last mortgage payments were one year ago because he could not afford to pay a \nmortgage on his current home in state B as well as state A. (Tr. X) A second set of tenants \nwere also evicted in March 2019. \n \nApplicant recounted how he and his wife purchased a home in state B in 2013. He \nput a down payment on the house. His wife handles the finances for the family. (Tr. 39)  \nHe could not recall her precise salary, but believed it may be $110,000. Applicant was \nworking for a small company earning about $80,000. (Tr. 29)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant purchased three or four investment properties when he came to state B. \nHe and his business partner purchased the homes between 2016 and 2018. (Tr. 95-101) \nThe purpose was to fix the homes and eventually resell them. (GE 1) Applicant borrowed \nfrom his 401(k). He also used a credit card to get some advance cash. (Tr. 62) Equity \nfrom one house was used to purchase another. Each home purchased turned into a \nnightmare. (Tr. 53-58) The cost of repairs were higher than they imagined and some of \nthe contractors did not complete the required work. Two houses are now rented. (Tr.60)  \nApplicant stated that he plans to end this business relationship because he believes that \nhis partner has cheated him out of some money that was received from equity in one \nhouse. \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, an account past-due in the approximate amount of $16,383, \nApplicant has not paid this first mortgage on the home in state A for about one year. (Tr. \n80) He submitted documentation concerning the circumstances. It is still not resolved. .He \ndid attempt to refinance the house at one point. (Tr.80) He admits that he has not done \nanything to resolve the issue since 2018. \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, an account past-due in the amount of $2,302 for a second \nmortgage on the house in state A. Applicant stated the reason for this second mortgage \ncharge-off is due for the same reasons as stated for SOR 1.a. In 2017, Applicant received \na settlement offer from the bank to settle for $17,000. The bank wanted a lump sum \npayment and Applicant did not have the money. The bank also offered Applicant a 12 \nmonth payment plan for a monthly amount of $1,600, but Applicant stated that he did not \nhave the money in his budget. In 2016, Applicant requested monthly payments of $225 \nuntil the $17,000 is paid in full. (AE A) He hopes to do a short sale. \n \nAs to SOR 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $13,019, Applicant is trying \nto settle this account. It was a credit card used for an educational course. At first, he \ndisputed the amount due to the course nature not being what was promised. Applicant \nbelieved it was fraudulent.  He submitted an article entitled RIPOFF REPORT, (AE B) \nproclaiming the company has received many complaints. The charge was removed from \nthe credit card, but after an investigation the charge of $5,000 was added with interest \nand penalties, which exceeded his maximum amount of credit. The bank closed the \naccount eventually. Applicant\u2019s payment increased from $180 a month to almost $500 a \nmonth, which he claimed he could not afford. He stated that negotiations did not continue. \nApplicant recalled that he also used the credit card for a $6,000 advance to assist in an \ninvestment property. (Tr.  95) At this time, there is no payment arrangement or plan. \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a charged-off account in the amount of $334, Applicant recently \nresolved the account and provided documentation. (AE L)  \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a collection account in the amount of $5,686, this debt was the \nresult of a real estate course that Applicant took. He stated that the company was well \nknown, but it was a scam. He is disputing this amount. He attended a three day course.  \nHe paid $4,700, but still owes about $5,686.This account is interrelated with 1.c. (Tr. 112) \nApplicant submitted letters that he wrote to state officials complaining about the company \nthat runs the course. (AE L) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant recently attended a financial counseling class. He and his wife both work \nin professional positions. Applicant\u2019s salary per year is about $104,000. He has a budget.  \nApplicant has a savings and checking account. He contributes to his pension account. \nApplicant approximated that he has about $80,000 in his 401(k). (AE L) He stated that he \nand his wife take an annual cruise. He sometimes sends money to his mother in her native \nhome. Applicant acknowledged that he pays a minimum amount on two other credit cards. \n(GE 1) He pays his taxes and is current on his home mortgage. Applicant travels to a \ncentral American country to see his family frequently, as recent as 2016. (Tr. 48) \n \n Applicant submitted several character letters. Each letter attests to his reliability \nas an engineer and his loyalty. Applicant is dedicated to his work and is trustworthy for a \nposition of responsibility.  One reference knows about his financial issues, and believes \nApplicant is working hard to resolve them. He works hard for his company and his family. \n(AE C) A former colleague states that his work ethic is beyond reproach. (AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n6 \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are the result of several things. In 2009, he became \nunemployed and rented his home in State A. Unfortunately, the tenant, after a number of \nyears, ruined the home and has not paid a judgment against her. Applicant could not pay \nthe mortgage for that house and the current house in state B. He also received legal \ncitations. He incurred legal fees. He received a settlement offer but could not accept \nbecause he did not have the money. This has been ongoing. He bought a house and then \ninvested in three or four properties using money from his 401(k) and a credit card. He \ntook a course that he believed is a scam and disputed it. He charged part of the fee on a \ncredit card. He invested in three properties when he already had financial issues with the \nhouse in state A.  This casts doubt on his judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  Applicant\u2019s unemployment, and other issues \nwere beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly. He recently paid one small \ndebt. He has disputed one debt but he has not resolved any debts. He promises that once \nhe has the money from the sale of house in state A, he will pay his debts. A promise to \npay in the future is not sufficient. He has also used his money for travel. He has no track \nrecord of paying these debts. He has not produced sufficient information to show that he \nhas been proactive in his actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not fully established. Applicant took a financial course \nafter the hearing. He now has a budget. From the evidence in the record, there are no \nclear indications that his financial situation is under control. He has not been able to start \na settlement plan for the mortgages because he does not have the money.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his credibility and openness at the hearing. Applicant had \ncircumstances that occurred beyond his control and he has made some strides in \nattempting to resolve the mortgage issues. However, at this time, Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. The property \ninvestments in state B, after the financial issues that existed from the house in state A do \nnot persuade me that Applicant\u2019s judgment is suitable.  Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n01/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nA complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on July 25, 2018, and submitted a \nresponse dated August 9, 2018, marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The Government\u2019s \nexhibits included in the FORM (Items 1 to 10) and AE A are admitted into evidence without \nobjections. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old logistics specialist employed by a government contractor \nsince April 2016. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1995. Applicant married in 1997, \nand has no children. She retired from the Air National Guard after serving from 1987 to \n2008. Applicant has a history of holding various security clearances. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has four alcohol-related arrests and convictions in \n1995, 2007, 2016, and 2017. She admitted the allegations, and submitted documentation \nin explanation and mitigation. \n \nIn 1995, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated after leaving a wine \nfestival. She was convicted and incarcerated for 180 days (177 suspended), fined, placed \non one-year probation, and ordered to attend a three-day alcohol counseling course. She \nstated in a 2006 personal subject interview (PSI) before a Government investigator that \nout of the three people involved, she drove the vehicle because she drank the least at the \nfestival, and that she has not consumed alcohol and driven since the 1995 arrest. She \nalso noted that her use of alcohol never affected her employment or personal life. \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence of \nalcohol. She pleaded guilty, was fined, and attended a weekend intervention program \nwhere she was purportedly diagnosed as an alcohol abuser.2 She also attended follow-\nup treatment at another facility, but no details of the treatment were provided. \n \nIn 2016, Applicant was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence of \nalcohol after she lost control of her vehicle, left the road and hit a pole. The police report \nnoted that upon approaching Applicant in her car, she was so intoxicated she nearly fell \nout of the car, could not perform roadside sobriety tests, could not stand on her own, and \nwas nearly carried to the police station. Her breathalyzer sample revealed a .334 blood \nalcohol content (BAC). She was convicted and ordered to serve 33 days confinement (30 \ndays suspended), fined, placed on one-year probation, and ordered to continue an \nalcohol treatment program already started. Details of the alcohol treatment program are \nnot available in the record. \n \nIn October 2017, Applicant was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence \nof alcohol following a traffic accident. Her attorney recommended she attend an alcohol \ntreatment program. She pleaded guilty and was ordered to be confined for 180 days (170 \n                                                     \n2 Applicant admitted the allegation, but the FORM does not contain documentation to support the diagnosis. \n\n \n3 \n \ndays suspended), home detention, supervised probation, fined, and ordered to undergo \na drug and alcohol evaluation. She was released from probation in April 2018. There is \nno record of the results of the drug and alcohol evaluation.  \n \nApplicant provided a short, hand-written letter from her therapist, dated June 21, \n2018. (AE A) The therapist noted that she was contacted after Applicant\u2019s \u201csecond OVI.\u201d3 \nShe noted Applicant\u2019s hard work in therapy on personal issues that led to alcohol abuse, \nbut did not expand on the issues involved, type and extent of treatment or therapy, or \ndiagnosis. The therapist stated that Applicant no longer drinks alcohol and has resolved \nher personal issues satisfactorily. She stated that Applicant was doing extremely well in \nher life, and was not a threat to national security. \n \nApplicant noted the support of her employer and the Air Force, but did not provide \nindependent evidence of such support. She also noted her dedication to her work and \nyears of holding a security clearance without a security violation. She also stated that in \nthe 15 months preceding her 2017 arrest, she fell on \u201chard times\u201d and life was extremely \ndifficult, but that she learned a valuable lesson, grew as a person, and changed her habits. \nSince Applicant elected a decision without a hearing, I was unable to inquire further into \nher alcohol treatment and evaluations, personal issues that led to alcohol related arrests, \nand any changes in lifestyle. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) in a Security Executive Agent Directive, effective on June 8, 2017. These AGs are \napplicable to this decision. \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \n                                                     \n3 At the time Applicant sought counseling with this therapist, she had four alcohol related driving arrests. \nApplicant\u2019s therapist did not disclose whether she was aware of Applicant\u2019s complete background of alcohol \nrelated criminal history or prior treatment. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant has a history of drunk-driving arrests and convictions for over 20 years. \nIn the 2016 arrest after an accident, her BAC was tested at .334%. One year later, she \nagain was found guilty of drunk driving after another vehicle accident. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history as detailed in the findings of fact, indicates a pattern of \nexcessive use of alcohol and driving while impaired. Despite recurring incidents of \nalcohol-related arrests, probation, and court-ordered education classes, she has not \nshown sufficient evidence of abstinence or the ability to drink responsibly. Her current \ntherapy is not conclusive since it is devoid of details of her alcohol use and treatment \nhistory, type and extent of therapy, and diagnosis. Because of the current therapist\u2019s \nincomplete report, her prognosis has little value. Additionally, Applicant has been treated \n\n \n6 \n \nor counseled after previous drunk-driving arrests, but relapsed and returned to drinking \nto intoxication and driving. The record is devoid of substantial evidence of a change in \nbehavior, and efforts to ensure that no further alcohol related incidents will occur. I am \nnot convinced that her newly claimed abstinence is credible or will be sustained in the \nfuture. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and Applicant\u2019s evidence is not \nsufficient to overcome concerns about her established pattern of excessive alcohol use. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s history of \nalcohol-related incidents and failure to show credible rehabilitation and a changed lifestyle \nremain an ongoing concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate with an electrical certificate received from a technical school in May 2012 and an emergency medical technician license earned in 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) He was married from May 2009 to January 2013. (Tr. 31-32.) He has a nine-year-old son and a six-year-daughter for whom he is obligated to pay child support to his ex-wife. His child support is approximately $261 a month. (GEs 1-3.) As of November 2018, Applicant and his cohabitant fianc\u00e9e were living with his parents. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e receives Social Security disability income (SSDI), and she has never been employed. (Tr. 28, 32-33.) Applicant graduated from high school in June 2006.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant owes approximately $14,347 in defaulted federal student-loan debt, $3,619 \nin child-support delinquency, $5,807 to a former landlord for past-due rent and damages, \nand some small collection debts. Unemployment and low income were factors in the \ndelinquencies, but his financial situation continues to raise security concerns. Clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n02/06/2019\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 1, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nSeptember 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 16, \n2018. With the agreement of the parties, I rescheduled the hearing for November 14, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted. A July 30, 2018 \nletter (HE 1) and a November 5, 2018 email (HE II) forwarding the proposed GEs to \nApplicant, and a list of the GEs (HE III) were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) for the record \nbut not admitted in evidence. One Applicant exhibit (AE A) was admitted in evidence. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 27, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for three weeks for post-hearing documentation from \nApplicant. No documents were received by the December 5, 2018 deadline, and I closed \nthe record on that date. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of May 21, 2018, Applicant was \ndelinquent on federal student loans totaling $13,823 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) and owed a past-\ndue debt of $1,891(SOR \u00b6 1.d). He also had three debts of $5,807 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $189 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $67 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) in collections. When he answered the SOR allegations, \nhe admitted the debts without explanation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate with an electrical certificate received \nfrom a technical school in May 2012 and an emergency medical technician license earned \nin 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) He was married from May 2009 to January 2013. (Tr. 31-32.) He \nhas a nine-year-old son and a six-year-daughter for whom he is obligated to pay child \nsupport to his ex-wife. His child support is approximately $261 a month. (GEs 1-3.) As of \nNovember 2018, Applicant and his cohabitant fianc\u00e9e were living with his parents. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e receives Social Security disability income (SSDI), and she has never \nbeen employed. (Tr. 28, 32-33.) \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2006. More than a decade ago, \nApplicant worked at a commissary on a military installation. (AE A.) It is unclear whether he \nheld any other employment before matriculating at a community college in August 2007. \nAfter withdrawing from the college in October 2007, Applicant worked odd jobs \u201cunder the \n\n3 \n \ntable\u201d for his uncle. From February 2011 to May 2012, Applicant attended a technical \ninstitute to obtain his certificate to work as an electrician. (GEs 1, 4.) Applicant paid for his \ntechnical training in part with federal student loans. He obtained loans of $5,378 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and $3,500 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in March 2011, and of $1,125 in March 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n(GEs 2-3.) While in school, Applicant worked for a local electric company \u201cunder the table\u201d \nduring the summer of 2011. (GE 4; Tr. 34.) \n \nIn January 2013, Applicant and his ex-wife divorced, and he was ordered to pay \nchild support. (GEs 1, 3.) According to Applicant, his child-support obligation was \u201cpro-rated \nfor [his] earning potential at $350 a week, based on a job [he] didn\u2019t have.\u201d (Tr. 27.) There \nis no evidence that he held any employment other than working for his uncle. After two to \nthree months of litigation, his child-support obligation was lowered to $150 a week. (Tr. 27.) \n \nApplicant was employed by a solar-installation company from April 2015 to July \n2015, when he was fired. Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator in January 2018 that he was fired for operating a vehicle aggressively in the \ncompany\u2019s parking lot. He accidentally accelerated quickly. (GE 4.) At his hearing, \nApplicant testified somewhat discrepantly that the company had a two-strike system. His \nfirst strike occurred when a 19-year-old informally under his charge drove through the back \nof the main panel and hit the bus barn. The second strike was that Applicant \u201cdumped the \nclutch\u201d by accident on a company vehicle. (Tr. 34-35.) \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant started working for a local electrical business. He \nindicates that he missed work when his son was hospitalized for a brain tumor, and was \nterminated for attendance issues in April 2016. (GE 4; Tr. 35.) \n \nIn August 2016, Applicant was placed by a temporary agency as a chemical \ncompounder for a pharmaceutical company. He moved from his parents\u2019 home into an \napartment with his fianc\u00e9e. After not reporting to work for three days due to illness in \nNovember 2016, Applicant was terminated by the temporary agency, even though he \nmaintains that he left a voice message that he was unable to report due to illness.1 (GE 4; \nTr. 36.) He and his fianc\u00e9e lived off her disability income, his unemployment compensation, \nand some financial assistance from his parents, but it was not enough to meet all of his \nfinancial obligations while he was unemployed. He fell behind on his child support (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d), and he and his fianc\u00e9e were evicted from their apartment in late June 2017 for \nnonpayment of rent.2 (GE 4.) In August 2017, Applicant\u2019s former landlord placed a $5,807 \ndebt for back rent and damages to the apartment for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant and \nhis fianc\u00e9e vacated the apartment owing $744 in utility charges for which Applicant was \nlegally liable for repayment. The debt was placed for collection in August 2018 (not alleged \nin SOR). (GEs 2-3.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant told the OPM investigator in January 2018 that he had the flu. (GE 4.) He testified discrepantly that \nhe lost his job because he had to drive his ill mother for medical treatments every other day. (Tr. 33.) \n \n2 Applicant testified that his monthly rent was $791, but he was charged an extra $300 a month for late \npayment of his rent. (Tr. 49.) \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e moved in with his parents in their home in July 2017. \nSince then, he has primarily worked for his father, who owns a barbecue company, in lieu \nof having to pay rent. Applicant has also worked for his uncle, who is a carpenter. Applicant \nhas done odd jobs for neighbors. (AE A; Tr. 29, 38.) Applicant worked in a temporary \nassignment at a sheet-metal factory from June 2017 to November 2017. (Tr. 37.) \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant was offered a position as an outside electrician at \n$18.65 per hour with a defense contractor, contingent on him obtaining a security \nclearance. (Tr. 31.) On November 20, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an \ninquiry concerning any delinquency involving enforcement in the last seven years, \nApplicant disclosed that he was $800 behind in his child-support payments, but that his \nfianc\u00e9e has been paying his child support for him \u201con the first of the month.\u201d Applicant \nresponded negatively to inquiries concerning any delinquency on routine accounts. (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 12, 2017, revealed that his federal \nstudents loans were in collection for $8,140 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $4,352 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and $1,331 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant was 120 days or more past due on his child support in the amount \nof $1,891 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant also owed collection debts of $5,807 to his former \nlandlord (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $189 for medical services from October 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $67 \nfor wireless-telephone services from December 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). (GE 2.) \n \nOn January 22, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe OPM. Applicant related that he and his fianc\u00e9e were evicted from their apartment in \nJune 2017 for nonpayment of rent. He estimated that he owed his former landlord one \nmonth\u2019s rent of $791 and damage/utility charges of approximately $2,000. He indicated \nthat he had not received a bill, but he planned to pay the debt once he started working for \nthe defense contractor in approximately March 2018. Applicant volunteered that his child- \nsupport arrearage had increased to $1,000 because of his unemployment, but he also \nindicated that his cohabitant fianc\u00e9e has been making payments for him. He also \nvolunteered that he owes an excise-tax debt from 2013 for a vehicle that was totaled in an \naccident, although the record does not reflect the amount of the debt. He indicated that he \nowes $1,200 on a delinquent credit-card account that he opened in 2006 (not alleged in \nSOR). He had taken a $900 cash advance for living expenses that he then failed to repay. \nApplicant admitted that he was still receiving demands for payment from the creditor. When \nconfronted with the adverse credit entries on his credit record, Applicant expressed his \nbelief that the $189 collection debt was an outstanding cable-television debt from his \nformer apartment that he thought was his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s responsibility. About the federal student \nloans, Applicant stated that his parents obtained the loans and have been repaying them. \nHe denied knowing that his name was on the loans, but also indicated that he would \ndiscuss them with his mother. Applicant expressed an intention to begin to repay his debts \nwhen he starts his employment with the defense contractor. The investigator gave \nApplicant an opportunity to provide documentation about the debts on his credit record. He \nprovided no documents. (GE 4.) \n \n\n5 \n \nAs of November 5, 2018, Equifax was showing no progress toward resolving his \nfederal student loans, which had accrued to $8,499 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $4,486 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and \n$1,362 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Likewise, Applicant had not made any payments toward the $5,807 \ncollection debt owed his former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.e) or a $744 utility bill in collection from \nthat apartment (not alleged in SOR). His child-support arrearage was $3,619 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nWhen asked to explain the arrearage, given he had told the OPM investigator that his \nfianc\u00e9e was making his child support payments, Applicant responded that \u201cshe was at one \npoint.\u201d (Tr. 42.) Applicant made a child-support payment of $200 in September 2018. (GE \n3; Tr. 43.) He testified that his child-support obligation is currently $50 a week (Tr. 27), \nwhile his credit report reflects a scheduled amount of $261 monthly. (GE 3.) The $189 and \n$67 collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g) were no longer on his credit record, but there is \nno evidence that they have been paid.  \n \nApplicant testified that he has paid as many of his bills as he is able based on his \nlimited income. He has been helping to care for his ill mother and grandmother and \nindicates that he has not had the time or money to pay off his debts. (Tr. 20, 30.) He \nworked on and off for electrical companies, as he was laid off when the job for which he \nwas hired ended. (Tr. 39.) When he was employed, his take-home pay was approximately \n$350 a week from which he paid child support at $78 weekly, which included $28 toward \nthe arrearage. He testified that he incurred some $35,000 in legal fees to obtain joint \ncustody of his children. He averred that he paid a $10,000 retainer fee upfront in 2012 and \nthen $300 a month toward the $25,000 balance. (Tr. 22-23, 26.) Applicant later explained \nthat he and his mother obtained a loan against her credit and paid off his attorney. (Tr. 48.) \n \nApplicant testified about his federal student loans that he was granted four hardship \ndeferments that were each valid for two years. However, he then claimed that when he last \nobtained a deferment four years ago, he was told that it was good for four years. (Tr. 23-\n24.) His November 2018 credit report shows that his student loans have been seriously \ndelinquent since September 2016 (GE 3), which calls into question his deferment claim \nabout the length of the latest deferment. He testified that he spent hours on the phone \ntrying to determine if he can get another deferment and that he has had no success in \nascertaining to whom he is supposed to make his student-loan payments. He understands \nhis student loans are in collection status. (Tr. 40.) He also indicated that he and his parents \nhave tried unsuccessfully to obtain a consolidation loan to address his student loans. \nApplicant was granted three weeks after his hearing to submit documentation of any or all \nof his claimed deferments. He presented no documentation, even though he stated that he \nhad emails about the deferments and documentation showing that he had applied for a \nconsolidation loan. (Tr. 24, 40-42.) \n                                                 \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant fianc\u00e9e receives disability income of $791 monthly. Applicant \nintends to claim her as a dependent on his income tax returns for tax year 2018. He \nexpects that he overpaid his income taxes and that his refund will be seized by the state \nand applied to his child-support arrearage. (Tr. 28.)  \n \nApplicant testified that he attempted to arrange for repayment of his $5,807 debt to \nhis former landlord, but he was told to deal with the collection entity. (Tr. 43-44.) Applicant \n\n6 \n \nasserts that he would have repaired the little holes in the walls from his children and \ncleaned the dirty carpets, but he was evicted and so did not have the opportunity to fix the \ndamages to the apartment. (Tr. 44.) Applicant asserts that the $67 cell-phone debt in \ncollection was supposed to have been paid by his ex-wife on their divorce. He \nacknowledged that the account was in his name, however. (Tr. 45.) He disputes the validity \nof the $189 medical debt in collection because his children had medical insurance \ncoverage from the state. (Tr. 45.) As for the utility debt in collection for $744, Applicant \ntestified that he was charged for power for six months after his eviction. (Tr. 48.) \n \nApplicant had no funds in checking or savings accounts as of his hearing in \nNovember 2018. He was working directly for his parents. His parents require him to work \n12 hours a month in exchange for paying rent of $300. Any work beyond those hours pays \nfor his food, gasoline, and other expenses. (Tr. 45-46.) Applicant has applied for public \nassistance but been denied because he lives with his parents, and his father\u2019s earnings \ndisqualify him. (Tr. 47.)   \n  \nA longtime friend of Applicant\u2019s provided a character reference letter for him. They \nmet 16 years ago, and they were once co-workers at the commissary on a military \ninstallation. They see each other frequently. She described Applicant as \u201can incredibly \nfocused and driven individual.\u201d She knows him to be \u201ca very reliable, trustworthy and \ndependable person.\u201d Applicant has kept a positive attitude despite struggling to find full-\ntime, gainful employment. He has been a devoted father to his two children. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \n\n7 \n \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \n\n8 \n \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the available credit reports establish the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant defaulted on federal student loans that were obtained for \napproximately $10,003 and have accrued to $14,347. He fell behind on his child support, \nand his arrearage of $1,891 as of July 2018 has increased to $3,619. He was evicted from \nan apartment in June 2017 for non-payment of rent, and his former landlord placed a debt \nof $5,807 for collection. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit record also includes two small collection debts of $189 for medical \nservice and $67 for wireless-phone service. He disputes the debts because his children \nhad medical insurance and the phone debt was supposed to have been paid by his ex-\nwife. Under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish controverted facts. The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 08-\n12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) that a credit report is sufficient to meet the \ngovernment\u2019s burden of producing evidence of delinquency: \n  \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nNeither of those two collection debts appears on Applicant\u2019s recent credit report of \nNovember 2018. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial \nitems from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt \nbecoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.1 \nIn that regard, both debts are from 2011, so they may no longer be legally collectible. \nDebts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is \nnot going to be paid or when the debt has been charged off. The mere fact that debts have \nbeen deleted from a credit report does not necessarily mean that they were not owed at \none time. Applicant did not provide any documentation to disprove his responsibility for \nrepayment. That said, they are so minor that they are unlikely in and of themselves to be a \nsource of undue financial pressure, even given his limited financial means. \n \nApplicant volunteered during his subject interview that he owes a $1,200 credit-card \ndelinquency from 2009 for which he was still receiving demands for payment. That debt \ndoes not appear on any of the available credit reports, perhaps because it is so old. A $744 \ncollection debt for utility services at his apartment was not assigned for collection until \nAugust 2018, which could explain why it was not included on his December 2017 credit \nreport or alleged in the SOR. The credit card and utility delinquencies cannot be \nconsidered for disqualifying purposes because they were not alleged.3 Even without \n                                                 \n3 In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows: \n \n\n9 \n \nconsidering those debts, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d clearly apply.  \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing matters in mitigation. One or more of the \nfollowing conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are too recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Available \ncredit information reflects that Applicant\u2019s federal student loans have been seriously \ndelinquent since September 2016, which calls into question his claims of a deferment \nobtained four years ago for another four years. He was in arrears $3,619 in his child- \nsupport payments as of November 2018. The $5,807 collection debt owed a former \nlandlord was incurred in 2017. Although the $189 medical debt and $67 wireless phone \ndebt were not incurred recently, they have not been resolved. \n \nDivorce is a circumstance contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant testified, albeit \nwithout corroboration, that he incurred $35,000 in legal fees to obtain joint custody of his \ntwo children, and he had to pay a $10,000 retainer fee upfront. However, low income \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \n\n10 \n \nappears to be the primary cause of his current financial problems. He testified that he has \nbeen repeatedly laid off from electrical jobs when projects were completed, and he has \nstruggled to find full-time employment that would provide him the income to address his \ndebts. In that regard, AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. Applicant was fired from some \npositions for attendance issues when either he or family members were ill, although \napparently Applicant did not follow company policy regarding reporting his absence in \nNovember 2016. He also bears some responsibility for his firing from his job with the solar \ncompany in 2015 because it was his conduct in either driving aggressively in the parking lot \nor \u201cdumping the clutch\u201d on a company vehicle that led to his termination. \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, Applicant is required to have acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. An element of financial responsibility is knowing the status of one\u2019s \nfinancial obligations. Regarding his child-support delinquency, Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator that his cohabitant fianc\u00e9e was making payments on the debt, but also that his \narrearage had risen to $1,000 because of his unemployment. His arrearage was then \n$1,891. When asked about his student loans during his January 2018 interview with an \nOPM investigator, Applicant denied knowing that his name was on the student loans. He \nclaimed that his parents obtained the loans and were repaying them. At his hearing, he \ntestified that he obtained hardship deferments over the years, which cannot be reconciled \nwith his claims that the loans were not in his name and that his parents were making \npayments. He testified about a deferment of his student loans in 2014 that he claims was \nvalid for four years rather than the usual two years. Available credit information showing \ndelinquency status for the loans since September 2016 belies his claim about the \ndeferment. Applicant had the opportunity to provide documentation showing efforts by him \nto obtain hardship deferments, and he presented no documents, which makes it difficult to \nfind that he acted responsibly with regard to his student loans. \n \nGiven that his child-support arrearage accrued to $3,619 as of November 2018, it is \nevident that his fianc\u00e9e made little to no payments for him in the past year. Applicant made \na child-support payment in September 2018, but this one payment is not enough to \nestablish either AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant has made no payments toward the \nother debts in the SOR, including his student loans and the $5,807 collection debt. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he would have cleaned the apartment and repaired the damages \nhad he been given time does not relieve him of his legal liability for the full $5,807. He did \nnot present documentation showing that any of the debts in the SOR are not his legal \nresponsibility. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(e) also does not apply. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-01473, decided on August 10, 2018, the Appeal Board \nreaffirmed that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness, I note that apart from working for relatives, he has not had any sustained \nemployment for several years now, and he lacks the income to meaningfully address his \ndebts. Applicant expressed an intention to repay his debts if he is granted security \nclearance eligibility so that he can start working for a defense contractor. \n \n\n11 \n \nAppendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) grants administrative \njudges the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security \nclearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not completely \nmitigated with the provision of additional security measures. I have considered the \nexception in Appendix C of the Directive and decline to apply it. Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is far from resolved. He was either ignorant about the status of his federal student \nloans or not fully forthcoming about them during his subject interview. As for his child \nsupport, he indicated on his SF 86 that his fianc\u00e9e has been paying his child support \u201con \nthe first of the month.\u201d He told the OPM investigator that his fianc\u00e9e has been paying his \nchild support. Yet, when confronted with the evidence showing that his arrearage had \nalmost doubled by November 2018, Applicant responded that his fianc\u00e9e was making \npayments \u201cat one point.\u201d Applicant did not explain why his fianc\u00e9e had been unable to \nmake payments in the last year, especially given her ongoing receipt of SSDI and the fact \nthat they do not pay rent to his parents. Applicant\u2019s checkered employment record does not \nsuggest reliability. He presented no documentation showing that he has done all that he \ncould within his limited means to address his debts. The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not adequately mitigated. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nA longtime friend of Applicant\u2019s has known him to possess good judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. Applicant testified about repeatedly being laid off when jobs ended, \nand his friend indicates that Applicant has struggled to find full-time, gainful employment. \nFor most of the past decade, Applicant has either worked \u201cunder the table\u201d for his uncle or \nfor his father, who does not charge him rent provided he puts in 12 hours a month. \nApplicant lacks a track record of reliability with respect to his employment record and his \nhandling of his financial obligations. Even accounting for some circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, Applicant has not shown that he possesses the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required for security clearance eligibility. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted, I cannot find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n12 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d through 1.i, and 1.r. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.j through 1.q. At the hearing, Applicant stated that his previous admission to SOR \u00b6 1.i was a mistake, and denied owing this debt. (Tr. 25) Applicant is 40 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1998. He married in 2000 and divorced in 2001. He considered himself to be in a common-law marriage from 2003 to at least 2017.

Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file Federal and state income tax returns for three consecutive years, his significant \noutstanding state tax liens and other delinquencies, and the length of time they remained \nunresolved, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 5, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn June 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nOn July 3, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nOctober 29, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On December 31, 2018, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor January 15, 2019. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n04/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1-5, and Applicant offered two exhibits, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and B. There were \nno objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to leave the record open until February 15, 2019, in the event he wanted to \nprovide additional documentation. On January 25, 2019, DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.). On February 12, 2019, Applicant requested additional time to obtain a \nstate tax lien document, and he wanted additional time to file his 2013-2015 income tax \nreturns. On February 13, 2019, I granted his request to hold the record open for an \nadditional two-week period from the date of my ruling. On February 26, 2019, Applicant \nsubmitted two documents, which I labeled as (AE) C and D, and admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The record closed on February 27, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d through 1.i, and \n1.r. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.j through 1.q.  At the hearing, Applicant stated that his \nprevious admission to SOR \u00b6 1.i was a mistake, and denied owing this debt. (Tr. 25)   \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1998. He married in \n2000 and divorced in 2001. He considered himself to be in a common-law marriage from \n2003 to at least 2017. He legally married his common law spouse in 2018. He has three \nchildren, ages 4, 9, and 12. He is employed with a Federal contractor as a fire pump \ntechnician since October 2016. He does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. \n(Tr. 8-9; GE 1, GE 2) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax \nreturns for 2013, 2014, and 2015.1 He owes seven state tax liens totaling approximately \n$14,323. He is also indebted for a deficiency balance from his mortgage, a delinquent \nstudent loan, a repossessed car deficiency balance, and various other forms of consumer \ndebt. These debts total approximately $55,000. Applicant attributed his financial problems \nto a failed business he opened in March 2013 and closed in September 2013.2 He was \nthen underemployed in 2013-2014, which provided a minimal amount of income. (Tr. 23) \n \n The record established the status of Applicant\u2019s unpaid accounts and untimely \nfiled tax returns as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to file state and Federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. He has not filed these tax returns because \n                                            \n1 Department Counsel asked to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a to include tax year 2013, to conform to the testimony \nand evidence presented at the hearing, which I granted without objection. \n \n2 There is a discrepancy in dates when comparing the SCA with the dates provided in Applicant\u2019s testimony \nat the hearing. I used the dates of self-employment listed on the 2017 SCA. (GE 1) \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nhe claimed his previous employer has not provided him with the necessary tax \ndocumentation. At the hearing, he admitted that he has not contacted the Internal \nRevenue Service or state tax agency to discuss these tax issues. On February 26, 2019, \nApplicant submitted two documents showing that he was continuing to have taxes \nassessed against him by the state for his business that closed in 2013. He also provided \nan agreement with a company he hired to help him resolve his state tax issue and assist \nhim in filing his 2013-2015 state and Federal income tax returns. (Tr. 15-19, 33; AE C, \nAE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c3 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) alleges a mortgage deficiency in the amount of $12,668, \nafter Applicant\u2019s residence was sold via short sale in 2015. Applicant claimed that he \ncould not recall if he received a 1099-C from the mortgage creditor to reflect the deficiency \namount as income for his unfiled 2015 income tax return. Applicant admitted that he had \nnot contacted this creditor to resolve this financial issue. (Tr. 29-33) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a deficiency balance of $14,157, the amount due after a car \nwas repossessed for failure to make timely payments. Applicant purchased a new car in \nlate 2012, but it was repossessed approximately one year later. This account has not \nbeen resolved, and he has not contacted this creditor. (Tr. 22, 24) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a delinquent account in the amount of $9,902, which Applicant \nused to purchase tools for his business he opened in 2013. At the time of his hearing, \nApplicant had not taken any action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 23-25) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges an unpaid utility account in the amount of $788. Applicant moved \nfrom state A to state B, and did not realize that he had an outstanding utility bill. He has \nnot made any payments on this account, but stated he hopes to pay this account in full in \nthe near future. As of the date of the hearing, he had not made any contact with the \ncreditor. (Tr. 24-25) \n \n In January 2019, Applicant paid the two outstanding medical bills alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, in the combined amount of $130. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 25; AE \nA, AE B)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i -1.o allege seven state tax liens filed in the total amount of $14,323. \nApplicant claimed the state tax liens were related to his 2013 self-employment. During \nthe time he operated his business, he did not file or report quarterly earnings to the state. \nThe state then filed the maximum amount of taxes for each quarter. The seven tax liens \nare for seven quarters, and include taxes assessed against Applicant long after he closed \nthe business in September 2013. Applicant admitted that he failed to notify the state when \nhe closed his business. In about August 2018, Applicant filed a form through the state \nwebsite providing notice that he had closed his business in September 2013. He admitted \nthat he had not called the state tax agency directly to discuss the seven tax liens filed \nagainst him. On February 26, 2019, Applicant provided a document showing that the state \n                                            \n3 Note SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.p are duplicate allegations with the same creditor, which is actually a \nmortgage creditor and not a student loan creditor, as mistakenly alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 29-31) \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \ncontinued to assess taxes against him in at least 2017. He also submitted a signed \nagreement dated February 2019 with a tax resolution company to provide assistance with \nhis current tax issues. (Tr. 25-29; AE C, AE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q alleges a delinquent student loan in the amount of $16,577. Applicant \nstated that he has only had one student loan account, and his tax refunds for tax years \n2016 and 2017 were intercepted to pay this outstanding debt. He claimed that the balance \nof his unpaid student loan is approximately $11,439. He failed to provide documentation \nwith his SOR response and at the hearing. On February 27, 2019, Applicant stated that \nhe had called the student loan servicer and claimed his current outstanding student loan \nbalance was $11,276. He asked that his 2018 tax refund be voluntarily intercepted to pay \nthis account. Applicant failed to provide any supporting documentation with his e-mail to \nshow the current student loan balance, or whether this account has been fully resolved. \n(Tr. 34-35, e-mail dated February 27, 2019.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r alleges a $750 debt owed to a bank. Applicant claimed this amount was \nfor a safety deposit box he had closed with the bank, but he did not provide the bank with \nthe safety deposit box key, as required. He admitted at the hearing that this debt had not \nbeen paid and he had not yet made contact with the bank to resolve this account. (Tr. 36-\n37) \n \nOn the January 2017 SCA, Applicant listed that he had not filed his tax returns for \n2013, 2014, and 2015. He listed that he disputed the state taxes for 2013, and was \nseeking the help of a tax attorney. For tax years 2014 and 2015, he listed that he had not \nfiled his tax returns due to negligence. He was currently working with a tax preparation \ncompany to resolve his tax issues. During his background interview in October 2017, \nApplicant admitted that he had not filed his state and Federal income tax returns for 2013, \n2014, and 2015, but it was his intention to file these tax returns. During his January 2019 \nhearing, he had not filed these state and Federal tax returns. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse \nclearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely based on whether the applicant has met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I \nhave considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19, and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. There are seven unreleased state tax \nliens in the amount of $14,323, and other unresolved delinquent debts in the total \napproximate amount of $55,000. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012),  \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n                                            \n4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant has not filed his 2013, 2014, and 2015 state and Federal income tax \nreturns; nor has he paid, settled, or resolved the seven state tax liens that were filed \nagainst him. Two weeks before this hearing, he paid two medical accounts in the total \namount of $130. He currently has approximately $55,000 of outstanding delinquent debt. \nHe has not contacted creditors to resolve or settle these accounts, nor has he made any \npayments on these accounts. Although he provided mitigating evidence of a failed \nbusiness and subsequent underemployment, which were circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he does not have a reasonable explanation as to why he has been unable to file \nthese state and Federal income tax returns over the past several years. His failure to give \npriority to such an important obligation as filing tax returns required by law causes \nlingering doubt about his reliability and security worthiness. I cannot conclude that he has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. There are no indications that his \ntax problems and other financial difficulties are under control. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), (b), (c), (d) and 20(g) was not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nGiven the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file Federal and \nstate income tax returns for three consecutive years, his significant outstanding state tax \nliens and debt with multiple creditors, and the length of time they have been unresolved, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g, 1.h and 1.p:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i - 1.o, 1.q and 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana in March 2014 while holding a security clearance since May 2010. (SOR 1.a) Under Guideline E, it alleged that Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA when he failed to disclose his illegal use of marijuana while holding a clearance (SOR 2.a and 2.b); and that he made false statements to a government investigator when he denied his marijuana use while holding a clearance (SOR 2.c and 2.d). Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from high school in 2001, and received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2018. He remarried in 2019, and his wife is expecting a child. He has three children from his prior marriage, ages 14, 12, and 7. Applicant enlisted in April 2003 and honorably served on active duty until November 2012 when he was discharged as a staff sergeant (E-6). Applicant held a clearance during most of his service. He volunteered for an eight-month overseas deployment to a dangerous area where he performed a sensitive mission. When he 3 returned to the United States, he was recognized and awarded with an assignment to a leadership position normally reserved for individuals above his pay grade.

He \nfalsified his 2015 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to disclose his \nuse of marijuana while holding a clearance and he made false statements to a \ngovernment investigator denying his marijuana use while holding a clearance. He failed \nto demonstrate reliability, trustworthiness, ability to comply with the law, and his ability \nto protect classified information. Personal conduct and drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns are not mitigated. Clearance denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 10, 2015, \nseeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his position with a \nfederal contractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse) \nand Guideline E (personal conduct) on May 30, 2018. Applicant answered the SOR on \nJune 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on January 16, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on May 14, 2019, setting the hearing for June 24, 2019. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered nine exhibits (GE 1 through 9). All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection, except for GE 5. (See Procedural Issue, bellow.) Applicant testified and \nsubmitted no exhibits or additional testimony. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on July 8, 2019. \nProcedural Issue \nApplicant objected to GE 5 (reports of four polygraph-assisted interviews) on the \ngrounds that the documents were incomplete. He requested the physiological reaction \nreport which reflects the polygrapher's assessment of whether Applicant was truthful \nwhen he answered questions during the interview. Applicant wanted to use the \npolygrapher\u2019s assessment to bolster his credibility at the hearing.   \n \nAt the hearing, I held the admission of GE 5 in abeyance and gave Department \nCounsel and Applicant the opportunity to request a complete copy of the report of the \nJuly 11, 2016 polygraph assisted interview from another agency. (Tr. 19 \u2013 27) \n \nAfter a thorough review of the evidence and the hearing transcript, I find that the \nphysiological reaction reports are irrelevant and provide little evidentiary value when \nconsidered or weighted in light of the evidence as a whole. Applicant\u2019s objection is \noverruled. GE 5 is admitted as evidence and will be considered in my decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana in March \n2014 while holding a security clearance since May 2010. (SOR 1.a) Under Guideline E, \nit alleged that Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA when he failed to disclose his illegal use \nof marijuana while holding a clearance (SOR 2.a and 2.b); and that he made false \nstatements to a government investigator when he denied his marijuana use while \nholding a clearance (SOR 2.c and 2.d). Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  \nAfter a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of \nfact:  \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2001, and received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He married in 2004 \nand divorced in 2018. He remarried in 2019, and his wife is expecting a child. He has \nthree children from his prior marriage, ages 14, 12, and 7.  \nApplicant enlisted in April 2003 and honorably served on active duty until \nNovember 2012 when he was discharged as a staff sergeant (E-6). Applicant held a \nclearance during most of his service. He volunteered for an eight-month overseas \ndeployment to a dangerous area where he performed a sensitive mission. When he \n\n \n3 \n \n \nreturned to the United States, he was recognized and awarded with an assignment to a \nleadership position normally reserved for individuals above his pay grade.  \n \nWhile in the service, Applicant was detailed to work for a government agency \n(Agency). After his discharge, he was immediately hired as an analyst by a federal \ncontractor and assigned to work for the Agency. Upon his employment, the Agency \nrequired Applicant to read and sign a personnel security policy advisory in March 2013 \n(GE 4). The document specifically warned Applicant that the illegal use of drugs (use, \npossession, transfer, sale, and purchase) was strictly prohibited by the Agency and \nviolation of the policy was grounds for disqualification for access eligibility.   \nIn March 2014, Applicant\u2019s employer sponsored his (and other co-workers) trip to \nanother country to attend a security conference. During a post-conference party at a \nnightclub, Applicant went outside to get some fresh air. He observed an unknown man, \nwho was also at the conference, smoking a marijuana cigarette. While they were \ntalking, the man offered Applicant the marijuana cigarette. Applicant took the marijuana \ncigarette, smoked two puffs from it, returned it to the man, and then went back inside \nthe club.  \nApplicant participated in polygraph-assisted interviews in August 2005, \nSeptember 2010, September 2014, April 2015, August 2015, and July 2016. During his \nAugust 2015 interview, Applicant was apparently having trouble passing the polygraph \nexamination and reported smoking two puffs from a marijuana cigarette in March 2014. \nHe explained to the interviewer that his intention at the time was to fit in. Applicant \ndenied any other personal involvement with illegal drugs in the last seven years. \nApplicant also disclosed that his best friend, a cleared contractor, smoked marijuana in \nfront of him all the time, including during the four days before his friend\u2019s successful \npolygraph examination. \nWhen Applicant smoked the marijuana, he had a top-secret clearance with \naccess to sensitive compartmented information (SCI), and he was aware of the \nAgency\u2019s policy prohibiting personnel involvement with illegal drugs. Applicant did not \ndisclose his illegal marijuana use during his September 2014 polygraph examination \nbecause he was afraid he would lose his clearance and then be fired from his job. \nApplicant stated he did not intend to have personal involvement with illegal drugs in the \nfuture. (GE 5) \nThe Agency revoked Applicant\u2019s SCI access in 2015-2016. He appealed the \nrevocation in March 2017 (GE 6), and the Agency affirmed the denial of SCI eligibility in \nJune 2017 (GE 7).  \nSection 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of Applicant\u2019s 2015 SCA asked \nhim to disclose whether: (1) in the last seven years he had illegally used (including \ninhaling, swallowing, experimenting with, or otherwise consuming) any drugs or \ncontrolled substances; and (2) he had ever illegally used or otherwise been involved \nwith a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions and failed to disclose his illegal use of marijuana in \nMarch 2014.  \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2016. During the \ncourse of the interview he denied any violation of security policies. He stated that he \nwas removed from his work building with the Agency because his conditional certificate \nof authority was removed after three inconclusive polygraph examinations in 2013, \n2014, and 2015. Applicant told the interviewer that he did not know why the tests were \ninconclusive and claimed he had done nothing wrong. (GE 8) \nApplicant was interviewed by another government investigator on January 29, \n2018. He was asked whether he had used illegal drugs in the last year, during the last \nseven years, and while possessing a clearance. Applicant adamantly denied any and all \nuse of illegal substances or drugs. The investigator confronted Applicant with his \nprevious admission to marijuana use in 2014 while possessing a clearance with SCI \naccess. Applicant admitted to the investigator that he took possession of the marijuana \ncigarette and placed it in his lips, but he claimed for the first time that he did not inhale. \n(GE 8) \nApplicant told the investigator that he had not reported the 2014 marijuana \nincident to his security office because he did believe that he actually used marijuana. \nApplicant stated to the interviewer that he omitted the 2014 marijuana incident from his \n2015 SCA because he did not inhale, and thus, he does not believe that he illegally \nused marijuana. (GE 8) \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant admitted that he took possession of the \nmarijuana cigarette, took two puffs from it, and marijuana cigarette smoke came out of \nhis mouth. (Tr. 36) Applicant explained the he answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions in \nSection 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2015 SCA, and denied any \nillegal drug use to the interviewer in January 2018, because he did not inhale and does \nnot believe that he illegally used marijuana. (Tr. 37-40) \nAlthough denying that he illegally used marijuana, Applicant acknowledged that \n\u201cpuffing\u201d the marijuana cigarette in March 2014 was unacceptable behavior. He believes \nthat this was an isolated incident, over five years ago, and should be mitigated with the \npassage of time. He highlighted his good service record, that he volunteered for a \nsensitive dangerous mission, and his good performance working for federal contractors. \nHe also noted that he is actively involved in his community where he volunteers \norganizing activities and coaching children. Applicant noted that he disclosed that his \nbest friend was a frequent marijuana user, and that he no longer associated with him or \nother people who use illegal drugs. Applicant also noted his changed circumstances \nincluding receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree, getting married in 2019, and his wife \nexpecting a child in the near future. \nApplicant testified that his criminal misconduct continues to weigh on him since it \nhappened. He does not intend on using any illegal drugs or controlled substances in the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfuture because he does not want to jeopardize his and his family\u2019s livelihood. Applicant \nhas never sought or received any medical or psychological treatment or counseling for \nhis substance abuse. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.    \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs:  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.  \nIn March 2014, Applicant illegally possessed and used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance granted to him in 2010 and access to SCI granted in 2012-2013. AG \n\u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nThe record established the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and \n(f), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Although Applicant\u2019s illegal use of \nmarijuana could be viewed as an isolated incident that occurred five years ago, I find \nthat when considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, it continues to cast \ndoubts on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and his suitability to hold a \nclearance.  \nBecause of his time in the service, rank, age, and education, Applicant knew that \npossession and use of marijuana is illegal under federal law. Furthermore, he was fully \naware of the Agency\u2019s policy against the use of illegal drugs by its employees and \ncontractors holding a clearance. Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his illegal use \nof marijuana to his security office when he returned from his trip in 2014. Even after \nrevealing his marijuana use during his 2015 polygraph examination, having his access \nrevoked by the Agency, and after his removal from the Agency facility, he failed to \nreport his illegal use of marijuana to his security office.   \nMoreover, Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA and made false statements to \ngovernment investigators in April 2016 (not alleged in the SOR) and in January 2018 to \ncover his illegal use of marijuana. His recent false statements to cover his illegal drug \nuse undercuts any mitigation of the drug involvement and substance misuse concerns, \neven though his drug use is less recent. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant stated his intent to never possess or use illegal drugs in the future. In \nlight of the record as a whole, I consider Applicant\u2019s empty promises to be lacking \nweight and credibility. Applicant knew the adverse security clearance consequences of \nhis substance misuse, and that did not dissuade him. Applicant failed to establish his \nreliability, trustworthiness, his ability to comply with laws rules and regulations, and his \nsuitability for a clearance. \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant falsified his 2015 SCA when he failed to disclose his illegal use of \nmarijuana while holding a clearance (SOR 2.a and 2.b); and he made false statements \nto a government investigator when he denied his marijuana use while holding a \nclearance (SOR 2.c and 2.d).  \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that \ncountry; \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States; \nApplicant\u2019s illegal possession and use of marijuana while possessing a \nclearance, his falsification of the 2015 SCA, and making false statements to a \ngovernment investigator satisfy the above disqualifying conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the same reasons discussed under Guideline H, none of the mitigating \nconditions is fully applicable to the facts in this case and they do not mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns. Applicant did not disclose his illegal marijuana \npossession and use until the 2015 polygraph examination. After that, he falsified his \n2015 SCA and made false statements to a government investigator.  \nApplicant continues to assert the na\u00efve excuse that because he did not inhale he \ndid not illegally used marijuana. Regardless, he illegally possessed marijuana, and the \nmore serious misconduct are his falsifications. In light of the record as a whole, I \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconsider Applicant\u2019s \u201cI did not inhale\u201d excuse to be lacking weight and credibility. It does \nnot explain or excuse his illegal possession of marijuana while holding a clearance and \naccess to SCI. Applicant failed to establish his reliability, trustworthiness, his ability to \ncomply with laws rules and regulations, and his suitability for a clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana and his falsifications continue to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He served in the \nmilitary for almost 10 years and has worked for federal contractors since 2012; has held \na clearance since 2005; and has worked for his current employer since 2012. Except for \nthe SOR allegations, his performance is considered to be a good. \nThe factors against granting a clearance are more substantial. Applicant\u2019s lack of \njudgment and his unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations continue to raise \nquestions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The substance misuse and personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n____________________________\nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 18, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

She provided documents that were \nmarked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection, and \nthe record closed.1 DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 26, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and 1.l through 1.v, \nand denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g.through 1.k. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1998. She married \nin 1988 and divorced in 1997. She remarried in 1998. She has children ages 23 and 19 \nyears old. Both children live at home. She has been employed by a federal contractor \nsince July 2017. She was laid off from a prior position in April 2017. She was unemployed \nfor a month, accepted a job in May 2017, and then resigned and accepted her current \nposition. She had to relocate to another state. She testified that she did not receive a \npaycheck for three months, and her husband was unemployed when they moved. \nApplicant testified that her salary was $90,000 in 2014, and it has incrementally increased \nto her current salary of $110,000, and her husband\u2019s current salary is $50,000.2  \n \n \nThe SOR debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and credit \nreports from August 2017 and April 2018.3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has had financial difficulties in the past. Her husband \nhad inconsistent employment and periods of unemployment. She said that since 2011, \nshe has been more financially stable because her husband has been working. She said \nthat prior to 2011, she was not earning as much money and was only paying for \nnecessities.4  \n \nApplicant testified that she timely filed her state income tax returns from 2003 to \n2012, but did not pay the taxes because she did not have enough money.5 She said she \nbelieved she paid one year, but could not recall which year. She did not make \narrangements at the time with the state taxing authority to pay her state income taxes. \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is Government Counsel\u2019s discovery letter. HE II is the Government\u2019s email. \n \n2 Tr. 15-24, 48-49. \n \n3 GE 1, 2, 3, 4. \n \n4 Tr. 24-29. \n \n5 Applicant testified that she timely filed her federal income tax returns. There are no allegations concerning \nher federal income tax returns. I have not considered any derogatory evidence that was not alleged in the \nSOR for disqualifying purposes. I considered it when making a credibility determination, in the application \nof mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nShe said she attempted to adjust her withholdings, but it did not make a difference. She \nsaid in 2011, she attempted to make a payment arrangement and contacted an \naccountant to recalculate her taxes. She said the state tax authority advised her that upon \npaying the delinquent taxes, it would forgive the penalties. State tax liens are alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($4,484-entered April 2014); 1.h ($528-entered January 2014); 1.i ($5,518-\nentered January 2014); 1.j ($5,163-entered January 2013); and 1.k ($2,969-entered \nNovember 2012).6  \n \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She \ndisclosed that in 2014 she was notified by the state taxing authority that she owed a \nsignificant amount of taxes dating back to 2004. She did not agree with the amount owed \nand had her accountant recalculate it. She told the investigator that she made an offer to \npay $800 a month to the state, but it was denied. She said she sent emails, letters, and \nfaxes to the taxing authority, but did not receive responses. She said she managed to get \nthe penalties waived. She continued to dispute the amount she owed. She said she would \ncontinue to actively try to resolve the tax debt. She provided a letter from the state taxing \nauthority from June 2015, which stated: \u201cPenalties will be waived upon payment of tax \nand interest.\u201d7  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she provided correspondence between her and \nthe state taxing authority. She made a request in May 2018 for a waiver of penalties for \ntax years 2008 and 2009. She listed that her total tax liability for those years as $11,092. \nThe request did not offer a settlement amount or monthly payment. Applicant testified that \nshe is still negotiating a payment arrangement with the taxing authority. She rejected an \noffer to make 12 monthly payments of $1,000 to settle the tax liens because she was not \nin a position to pay that amount, so she is still in negotiations. She testified that she could \nnot afford to make payments immediately because she has prioritized her daughter\u2019s \nschooling over paying her taxes. After her hearing, she provided an email dated \nNovember 26, 2018, to the state taxing authority for an offer in compromise to pay $1,000 \nfor 12 months beginning on January 15, 2019. No additional emails or correspondence \nwas provided to confirm the agreement was accepted.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the other debts alleged in the SOR were from 2005 to 2015. \nShe had medical insurance and many of the delinquent accounts alleged are unpaid \ncopayments. She said she did not have the money to pay the medical debts. She did not \nmake payment arrangements when these bills were owed. The charged-off debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a ($6,422) is a personal loan Applicant obtained in 2014. She testified that she made \npayments until she moved in April 2017. She stopped making payments and defaulted on \nthe loan. She testified she attempted to make a payment, but it was returned. Applicant \ntestified that the charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1.693) was a joint account she had with \nher father, who passed away in 2015. It was for a line of credit. She testified that she \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 29-30, 36-39. \n \n7 Answer to the SOR; GE 4. \n \n8 Tr. 29-44; Answer to the SOR; AE C.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nstopped paying the debt in July 2017. In May 2018, Applicant initiated a payment plan to \nmake monthly payments of $379 for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($6,422), 1.b ($4,324), 1.c \n($2,459), 1.d ($1,864), 1.e ($1,693), and 1.f ($772). She testified that she began making \npayments in June 2018. She provided proof of the agreement and an August 2018 \npayment.9  \n \n \nApplicant disputed many of the debts in her credit report. Many of the medical \ndebts were deleted. She did not provide detailed information as to which debts alleged \non the SOR were deleted. I have given her the benefit of the doubt and conclude those \nremaining medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m through 1.v were deleted.10  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l is owed to a college where Applicant enrolled for a course. \nShe did not complete the course and agrees she owes the debt, but has not paid it.11 \n \n \nApplicant testified that she did not have a budget. In her post-hearing documents, \nshe provided a budget worksheet that included her payment plan and an amount allotted \nto pay her state tax liens. She has not taken credit counseling. She testified that she lives \npaycheck to paycheck. She had a friend, who is an accountant, review her spending \nhabits and found that she spends $2,000 a month on food and that she goes to \nrestaurants four times a week. She has $900 in savings and no investments, other than \na 401k pension with $3,000-$4,000 in it. She admitted that she has been neglectful with \nher finances, which were overwhelming.12  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n                                                          \n9 Tr. 44-61; Answer to the SOR; AE B, C. \n \n10 Answer to SOR. \n \n11 Tr. 61-63; GE 3. \n \n12 Tr. 69-76; AE A. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has unresolved state tax liens and other delinquent debts that are not \nresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant was aware that she had not paid state taxes for numerous years and \nowed state tax liens. She testified she attempted to resolve the tax debts in 2011, but her \noffer was rejected. The state taxing authority has agreed to waive the penalties owed, but \nnot until she pays her delinquent liens. She has not started to make payments on the \nstate tax liens. After receiving the SOR, she initiated a payment plan for some debts. In \nher background interview, she admitted she failed to pay many medical debts. She later \ndisputed many of the medical debts, and they were removed from her credit report. \nApplicant has procrastinated for years in addressing her delinquent state taxes. There is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that her behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto pay her tax liens for years casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment, as does her failure to pay other delinquent debts she admitted she owes. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her husband\u2019s periods of \nunemployment. She lost her job for a short period and then had to move when she got a \nnew job. These matters may have impacted her ability to repay the state tax liens, but \nthey were not the cause of the tax problem. Applicant\u2019s failure to timely pay her taxes \nover several years was the cause. She attempted to obtain an offer of compromise and \nis hopeful, but she has not made any payments towards the tax liens that were entered \nin 2012, 2013, and 2014. After receiving the SOR, she began a payment plan towards \nsome of her debts, others remain unpaid. This does not constitute acting responsibly. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) has limited application. \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling and it is too early \nto conclude there are clear indications that her finances are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. Applicant recently arranged a payment plan for some of her delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e and 1.f. \n \n \nApplicant disputed debts on her credit report. Although she failed to provide details \nabout which medical debts were deleted, I conclude they are likely those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \nthough 1.v. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to those debts.  \n \n \nApplicant testified and provided emails that she was negotiating with the state \ntaxing authority. She has not made any payments toward the tax liens. AG \u00b6 20(g) has \nsome application.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old woman. She neglected to pay state income taxes and \nhas numerous tax liens that she has owed for at least four years. She did not take action \nto resolve other debts until after she received the SOR. Applicant does not have a stable \nfinancial track record nor a solid financial plan to resolve her debts. Despite being aware \nof the tax liens for years, they have not been a priority, and she has not paid them. The \nDOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to pay \nstate income taxes, which resulted in state tax liens, along with her failure to timely and \nresponsibly address other delinquent debts, raises serious concerns. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m-1.v: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Her debts \nwere due to circumstances beyond her control. She is addressing them in a responsible \nmanner and there is little likelihood that her financial problems will recur. Based upon a \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility is granted.  \nStatement of Case \nOn August 21, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn May 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations.

She made a \nrepayment agreement with her state and documented four payments under that \nagreement. She reduced this debt to $1,703. She is resolving this debt. She owes no \nFederal taxes. (AE A, attachment 8.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant was delinquent on 17 debts totaling $27,247. Her oldest debt, a vehicle \nloan, became delinquent in 2011. More recently, she incurred a number of delinquent \ndebts in 2017. She also had an unresolved state tax debt. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; (c) the individual \nhas received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe 17 SOR-alleged debts were incurred due to circumstances beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control, and those same circumstances are unlikely to recur. During the time \nshe incurred delinquent debt, she was a single mother supporting her child. She \nexperienced several periods of unemployment and underemployment. She did not have \nhealthcare insurance, but her child required costly emergency medical services. As a \nresult of these circumstances beyond her control, she incurred delinquencies. She \nrecently obtained a full-time position with medical benefits. The record shows that she is \nacting reasonably and responsibly by addressing her debts as her funds allow. She is in \ncontact with her creditors and has established a track record of systematically \naddressing her delinquencies. The evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nand 20(b), as the circumstances that contributed to her financial delinquencies are \nunlikely to recur; she is addressing her debts in a reasonable and timely manner as \nfunds allow; and her delinquencies not cast doubt on her current trustworthiness. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to repay her creditors, as funds \nallow. She has fully resolved three debts, documented payments on seven other \naccounts, and credibly claimed to be repaying four other accounts. One debt was a \nduplicate, and is being resolved. Only two debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1. h remain unaddressed, \nand she has plans to resolve 1.c, when the funds are available. She disputes 1.h, \nbecause she does not recognize the creditor and cannot track down the debt to identify \nthe creditor. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, \n1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to the debt she contests because \nthere is no documentation of the dispute. Nevertheless, it is mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) and 20(b), above. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant has made arrangements with the state tax authority to pay \nher tax debt. She is in compliance with those arrangements. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \n\u00b6 1.q. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Appeal Board has \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating:  \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrates that he has \u2018. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2 (a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR.1 \n \n \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a plan to resolve her \noutstanding delinquent debts within the standard defined in the above case. The \nlikelihood that financial problems will recur, or Applicant will stop making payments on \nthe plans she has initiated, is minimal based on her efforts to date and her knowledge \nthat similar problems could jeopardize her employment. The potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress is eliminated by Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debt. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She met her burden to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n                                                 \n1ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ryan C. Nerney, Esq.   \n \n08/20/2019 \n______________\nDecision \n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non February 2, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on June 8, 2018, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant, with assistance of counsel, answered the SOR on July 15, 2018. Of \nthe seven delinquent financial accounts alleged in the SOR, he admitted three, and he \nadmitted in part and denied in part four. He also provided a lengthy explanation of his \ncircumstances, and he enclosed proposed exhibits A-N. He requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \non December 4, 2018. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-6. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-S. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 12, \n2018. \nThe record was kept open for approximately 30 days, until January 4, 2019, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his \ncase. (Tr. 24, 56-57) Applicant made a timely submission, by e-mail, and those four \ndocuments are admitted without objections as Exhibits T-W.    \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. He works as a military jet aircraft mechanic and crew chief. He is responsible \nfor scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, pilot safety, and security. (Tr. \n18) He has had this job with a company in the defense industry since January 2017. His \nformal education includes a high school diploma, completion of military technical school, \nand a certificate as a medical assistant awarded in July 2016. Applicant\u2019s background \nincludes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force from November 2003 to about January \n2015, for about 11 years in total. (Exhibit E) His primary specialty in the Air Force was \ntactical aircraft maintenance. He obtained and held a security clearance while on active \nduty.  \n \nApplicant is twice married. His first marriage ended in divorce in June 2014, \nwhen he was serving in the Air Force. (Exhibit W) The couple separated in 2010. (Tr. \n19) He has three children from the marriage, ages 17, 14, and 11. Applicant shares \ncustody of the minor children with his former spouse as follows: one week with \nApplicant, two weeks with the mother, then alternating throughout the year. Applicant \nand the mother have joint legal decision making concerning the children. Applicant \nmarried his current spouse in 2014. He has three adult stepchildren from the marriage, \nnone of whom reside in his household. His mother-in-law, age 68, lives in Applicant\u2019s \nhousehold, and she contributes financially as she is able (e.g., buying grocery items). \nApplicant paid child support during the separation. The court ordered Applicant to pay \n$586 monthly in child support and $600 monthly in spousal maintenance for 36 months. \n(Exhibit W) The court-ordered amounts were based on Applicant\u2019s then military pay and \nbenefits.  \n \nApplicant has had inconsistent employment since his departure from military \nservice in January 2015. As a trained and experienced aircraft mechanic, he had a job \n\n \n3 \n \nlined up to work in that field, but the job fell through a few weeks before his discharge. \n(Tr. 61) As a result, he accepted a job as a forklift operator for $9 per hourl. (Tr. 21) He \nhad that job from February 2015 to September 2015. He next worked as a laborer until \nDecember 2015. He was an unemployed full-time student from December 2015 to July \n2016, when he completed the medical assistant certificate. He worked as a medical \nassistant from July 2016 to January 2017, when he began his current job working in \naircraft maintenance. He now earns nearly $33 per hour, and he estimated his gross \nincome for 2018 at about $64,000. (Tr. 65; Exhibit H) His spouse is a manager for a \ngrocery store, and he estimated her gross income for 2018 at about $27,000.   \n \nApplicant has largely admitted the delinquent financial accounts alleged in the \nSOR, and those allegations are also established by the documentary evidence. \n(Exhibits 2-6) In particular, the SOR concerns seven delinquent accounts, in collection, \ncharged off, or past due. The most serious are the past-due child or family support \naccounts indebted to a state department of economic security in amounts of $17,089 \nand $10,089. The remaining five delinquent accounts, in collection or charged off, range \nin amounts from $246 to $4,564 for a total of about $9,546. \nApplicant attributed his history of financial problems to loss of income when he \nleft military service in January 2015 and his inconsistent employment over the next two \nyears. He characterized the change in income as \u201cdrastic.\u201d (Tr. 20-21) He could not \nafford his child-support and spousal-maintenance obligations along with his rent and \nmonthly living expenses. (Tr. 19-22) As a result, he went into arrears on his court-\nordered payments. He explained that he was always making payments, but not the full \namount, perhaps $200 or $300 monthly. The situation changed in about January 2017, \nwhen he began his current employment in the defense industry. \nApplicant is no longer required to pay $600 monthly in spousal maintenance, as \nthat terminated after 36 months (June 2017). Although he remains in arrears for both \naccounts, since combined into one, he has made regular payments for the last two \nyears (2017 and 2018). He is now paying $586 for child support and about $136 extra \nfor arrears; pay stubs from December 2017 and June 2018 show a deduction of about \n$361, which totals $722 monthly. (Exhibit H)  \nThe current balance on the account with the state department of economic \nsecurity was $16,367, as of November 23, 2018. (Exhibit V) The balance was $17,484, \nas of July 3, 2018, which consisted of a child-support arrearage of $3,064 and a \nspousal-maintenance arrearage of $14,209. (Exhibit K at 1) Records also establish that \nfrom February 21, 2016, to July 5, 2018, he paid a total of $24,349, with $10,550 toward \narrears and $13,799 toward the current obligation. (Exhibit K) A payment of $7,937 was \nmade on March 7, 2016, which was an income-tax refund intercepted by the IRS. It was \napplied toward arrears. \nTurning next to the consumer debts, the $4,546 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nstems from an apartment lease Applicant co-signed for his first wife when they were \nmarried but separated. (Tr. 23-27, 49-51) He was unaware of this debt until receipt of \nthe SOR; he did not recall it during the background investigation. (Exhibit 2) His then \n\n \n4 \n \nwife was evicted from the apartment due to nonpayment of rent; the court ordered the \neviction in February 2013, although neither Applicant nor his wife were present in court; \nthe court entered a judgment in the sum of $2,385, plus a $230 late fee and $70 in court \ncosts. (Exhibit Q) Applicant entered into a payment arrangement with the current \ncreditor for $50 monthly, and he made the first monthly payment on December 12, \n2018. (Exhibit U at 2) \n \nThe $2,864 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.d stems from an unsecured personal \nloan Applicant obtained from a lender that serves the military community. (Tr. 27-31, 51-\n54) He defaulted on the loan due to inability to pay, making his last payment in \nDecember 2014, which was after his divorce was final and shortly before his discharge. \n(Tr. 54) The account is now in collection with a law firm; the current balance was \n$5,882, as of November 30, 2018; and Applicant agreed to a payment arrangement of \n$250 monthly. (Exhibit T) He made the first monthly payment on December 7, 2018. \n(Exhibit U at 2)  \nThe $101 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.e stems from an account with an electric \nutility. Applicant paid this account in full in January 2018. (Exhibit L) \nThe $1,771 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.f stems from an apartment Applicant \nhad leased. (Tr. 31-32) He moved out of the apartment thinking the security deposit \nwould cover any remaining expenses. The account was reduced to judgment in the \namount of $1,403, plus interest, and then collected via a writ of garnishment beginning \nin May 2017. (Exhibit J) The judgment was satisfied through the garnishment as of \nFebruary 2018. (Exhibit 6 at 1)  \n \nThe $246 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.g stems from a telecommunications \naccount. Applicant settled this account for the lesser amount of about $197 in August \n2017. (Exhibit I) \n \nApplicant recently qualified to obtain a mortgage loan to buy a home for about \n$183,000. (Tr. 35, 54-57; Exhibit 6 at 1-2) He bought the home in October 2017, and \nthen refinanced the loan to a lower interest rate with a different lender in May 2018. He \nhad some difficulty in qualifying for the loan, but was able to do so once he produced \npaperwork showing he had been paying child support. (Tr. 57) The loan is a $0 down \npayment mortgage issued by a private lender, and guaranteed by the U.S. Department \nof Veterans Affairs. The most recent credit report from November 2018 shows that both \nloans have been paid as agreed. (Exhibit 6 at 1-2)  \nIn addition to the home purchase, Applicant obtained financial counseling from a \nconsumer credit counseling organization in August 2018. (Exhibit N) The counseling \nappears to have been comprehensive, as it resulted in a 31-page report for Applicant\u2019s \nreview and use. Personal financial statements also establish that Applicant\u2019s household \nbudget has a positive monthly net remainder. (Exhibits M and N) \n\n \n5 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n\n \n6 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to a \ncombination of factors; namely, his divorce and the resulting support obligations, his \ndecline in income upon leaving military service, and his inconsistent employment for the \ntwo years prior to his current job. Those circumstances were largely beyond his control. \nHe acted reasonably under the circumstances by taking jobs below his qualifications \nand paying whatever he could afford. He made a major improvement to his situation by \nobtaining his current job, which has good pay and benefits. Given the circumstances, \nthe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his indebtedness. He \nreceives substantial credit for addressing the highest priority debt in the SOR, which is \nhis ongoing child-support obligation, and he is making progress on the arrears too. He \nalso receives credit for resolving the two minor collection accounts and the $1,771 \ncollection account. The latter was resolved after it was reduced to judgment and \n\n \n7 \n \ncollected via garnishment, which is not considered voluntary or in good faith under AG \u00b6 \n20(d), although some people prefer the garnishment process because it works. He also \nreceives credit for making payment arrangements for the two largest consumer \naccounts, the $4,564 collection account and the $2,864 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d. His efforts in that regard were quite recent, which suggests he was slow to \nact once he returned to better-paying employment in 2017. And there is no track record \nof payments for those two accounts, and so it is premature to conclude that he is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay those particular debts. Given the circumstances, \nthe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply in Applicant\u2019s favor, but he is \nentitled to partial credit for the reasons discussed above. \n \nApplicant did not present a perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all human affairs, \nperfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-collection \nprocedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An \napplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged \nin the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems \nand take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an \napplicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially \nresponsible and repay his creditors. There are clear indications that he is repaying his \ncreditors, and his financial problems appear to be under control. So long as he \ncontinues in his present job, which has good pay and benefits, it is most probable that \nhe will continue to make the court-ordered support payments and adhere to the \npayment arrangements for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. The financial \nconsiderations concern is mitigated.  \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility granted.  \n \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nJanuary 28, 2019 \n____________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 2, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2018.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, 2018, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 3, 2018. The Government \noffered six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A through D, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his \n\n \n2 \n \nown behalf. The record remained open until close of business on December 10, 2018, \nto allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  \nApplicant submitted two Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibits A and B, which were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on December 11, 2018. \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old.  He is married a second time and has a son from a \nprevious marriage.  He has a high school diploma and a certificate in computer \ninformation systems.  He holds the positon of Material Supply Handler with a defense \ncontractor.  He seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment \nin the defense industry.  \n \nParagraph 1 Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to eight separate creditors totaling \napproximately $61,000 in debts that include state and Federal tax liens, credit cards and \nother miscellaneous debt.  In his Answer, Applicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., \n1.d., and 1.h. set forth in the SOR.  He denies the remaining allegations.  Credit reports \nof the Applicant dated September 7, 2016; July 6, 2017; and June 4, 2018, reflect that \neach of these debts were owing at one point.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.)  \nApplicant served honorably in the United States Navy from 1991 to 1995, completing a \nfull enlistment period.   \n \n \nApplicant states that he began to have financial problems in about 2007.  He \nattributes his financial problems in the past to his health problems that caused him to \nlose his job, as well as just simply mismanaging his money by not always living within \nhis means.  Applicant states that among other things, he was paying too high in interest \non his car loan, and was paying a high monthly rent.  Neither of which allowed him a tax \ndeduction. \n \n \nApplicant began having financial problems in 2007 when he became delinquent \non his taxes and was unemployed.  In regard to his tax issues, he has consistently been \nin contact with the respective tax authorities and has set up payment plans that he has \nfollowed or requested payment extensions during periods of financial hardship.  He \nnotes that in 2006 he suffered a stroke, and eventually lost his job.  Following his stroke, \nhe was out of work for about nine months.  When his health improved, he went back to \nwork, but he is not sure if he was able to catch up with his delinquent debt.  In 2012, \nApplicant suffered a heart attack.  When Applicant tried to go back to work he was told \nthat he was being laid off due to budget cuts.  Applicant was out of work for about two \nyears from August 2014 to March 2016.     \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that without a house or children, he and his wife have had no \ntax deductions.  As a result, each year, they owe taxes.  To help cover living expenses \nwhen Applicant was out of work, each year, Applicant\u2019s wife would withdraw money \nfrom her 401(K), and sometimes sell her stock to help provide financially for the family.   \n \n \nApplicant testified that he believes that the reason he did not pay all of his taxes \nwhen they were due was not because he did not have enough money withdrawn from \nhis paycheck to pay his taxes, but instead, because each of those years he had \nadditional taxable income from 401(K) withdrawals and stock sales. \n \n \nSince June 2017, when Applicant started working for his current employer, he \nhas been working diligently to resolve his past delinquent debt.  The following \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR became owing and are now paid off in full, or are \nbeing paid in regular systematic monthly payments. \n \n1.a. Applicant was indebted to a state for a tax lien entered against him in 2010 in the \napproximate amount of $9,334.  Applicant provided a copy of an installment agreement \nwith the state indicating that he is now making monthly payments of $200 that goes to \npay this debt.  Applicant has been following an agreed upon payment plan with the state \ntax authority since 2010.            \n \n1.b.  Applicant was indebted to the Federal Government for a tax lien entered against \nhim in 2017 the approximate amount of $5,391.  Applicant provided a copy of a monthly \ninstallment agreement with the IRS indicating that he is now making monthly payments \nof $1,000 that goes toward payment of this debt.  Applicant has been following an \nagreed upon payment plan with the IRS since 2010.   \n \n1.c.   Applicant was indebted to Federal Government for a tax lien entered against him \nin 2014 in the approximate amount of $22,627.  Applicant provide a copy of a monthly \ninstallment agreement with the IRS indicating that he is making monthly payments of \n$1,000 that goes toward payment of this debt.  Applicant has been following an agreed \nupon payment plan with the IRS since 2010.          \n \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $19,769.  This was a voluntary vehicle repossession.  When \nApplicant contacted the creditor to set up a payment plan, they had no information in \ntheir system about the debt.  Applicant disputed this debt, and it was removed from his \ncredit report.  (Tr. p. 48.) \n \n1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $555.  Applicant submitted a receipt showing that the debt \nwas paid in full in the amount of $575 on September 8, 2018.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibit B.)                  \n \n1.f.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $2,463.  Applicant settled the debt in the amount of $700.00.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)              \n\n \n4 \n \n1.g.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $408.  This was a cable bill.  Applicant settled the debt in the \namount of $366.84.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)              \n \n1.h.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was past due in the \napproximate amount of $1,129.  Applicant was making regular monthly payments of \n$51.25 toward the debt.  It is now paid off.  (Tr. p. 50.)                \n \n \nApplicant is currently earning about $42,000 a year.  His wife brings in about \n$94,000.  Applicant\u2019s tax advisor with whom he has been closely working to improve his \ncredit rating, told him that it would be financially better for him to buy a house.  Applicant \nrecently purchased a house for $530,000 that he moved into in November 2018.  Using \nhis VA benefits, there was zero required as a down payment and his monthly payments \nare $2,936.  Applicant has an interest rate of 5 percent and he now has a substantial tax \nwrite-off.  Applicant states that going forward he plans to be more careful about how he \nspends his money.  He plans to put more money in savings and always live within his \nmeans.      \n \n \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor dated December 4, 2018, \nindicates that Applicant is well respected and held in high esteem by his colleagues.  He \nis described as a person of the highest character, entrusted to control and direct the \nflow of costly materials.  He is vigilant, detailed, and conforms to all required \nprocedures.  He is considered to be an excellent employee whose work is consistently \nexemplary and professional.    \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n5 \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;    \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n  \n \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts from extended periods of unemployment \nbrought on by health problems, job lay-offs, and by simply mismanaging his money.  As \na result he accumulated delinquent debt that include tax liens and credit card debt.  The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nSince June 2017, Applicant has been working hard to pay off his delinquent debt.  \nHe has shown significant progress toward resolving the debt listed in the SOR.  He has \neven improved his credit rating to become eligible to recently purchase a house that will \nin turn give him a tax write off.  Applicant clearly understands the responsibilities that \ncome along with possessing a security clearance.  He has demonstrated financial \n\n \n7 \n \nresponsibility by resolving his delinquent indebtedness.  Concerning his delinquent debt, \nhe has acted reasonably and responsibly, and has demonstrated good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.  The Financial Considerations concern has been \nmitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on December 6, \n2018.  \n12/17/2018\n\n2 \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 37 years old. She obtained her associate\u2019s degree in 2011 and her \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She has been employed as a human resources manager for \na federal contractor since July 2016.

She married in June 2001 and \ndivorced in June 2009. Applicant is a single mother of three children. Applicant has not \npreviously held a security clearance.   \n \nOn May 25, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), \nand in section 22 (Police Record) she disclosed her arrest in May 2016 when her previous \nemployer accused her of forgery and grand larceny alleging that she forged and cashed \nphony payroll checks. She also disclosed that she was fired from this job. She stated that \nthe case was dismissed by the court in December 2016.2 Applicant responded to the SOR \non June 21, 2018 (Answer) and denied creating the duplicate payroll checks, then cashing \nthem. An arrest warrant was issued on June 18, 2018, and she turned herself in to police. \nSince she could not afford an attorney, a public defender was assigned to her case. The \npublic defender advised her to pay restitution for the duplicate payroll checks that were \nfraudulently cashed, and she did. In return, the prosecutor dropped the charges. (Answer) \n \nApplicant\u2019s FBI criminal history record reflects the arrest for larceny by check on \nSeptember 12, 2016, and the case dismissal on December 12, 2016. (Item 6) However, \nthe offense report from the sheriff\u2019s department involved, reflects that on May 4, 2016, \nApplicant came in to report that persons unknown cashed two false payroll checks in her \nname at local retail stores after Applicant cashed the original check at a bank. (Item 5) \nInterestingly, when sheriff\u2019s deputies checked the loss detection video tapes in these local \nstores, they clearly show Applicant cashing the two checks. In her personal subject \ninterview (PSI), Applicant stated she left this employer by mutual agreement. (Item 4) This \ncontradicts her assertion in section 13A of her SCA (Employment Activities) that she was \nfired. She also stated \u201cI have absolutely no idea how these checks were printed or \ncashed.\u201d (Answer) She also stated it \u201cwas a poor decision on my part.\u201d  \n \n \n                                           Policies \n \n \nDOD took action in this case under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 25, 2017 Security \nClearance Application (SCA) (Item 2) and her summary of clearance interviews by background investigators \ndated January 22, 2017 and March 7, 2018 (item 3).  \n \n2 Item 2, p. 34. \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows:  \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nIn her Answer, Appellant denied the allegation in the SOR  and persists that she \nhas no idea how this could happen. Yet, she admitted to the warrant for her arrest and a \nplea deal by which she paid restitution for the two false payroll checks. There is ample \nevidence that she committed grand larceny by check according to the offense report from \nthe sheriff\u2019s office. It reflects that she was clearly visible on video tape committing these \ntwo crimes. The above disqualifying condition is applicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nAppellant provided no evidence of counseling, acceptance of responsibility, or \nrehabilitation. She was fired for lying to her boss when confronted with the video evidence \nshowing she had uttered the false instruments in question. She presented no evidence of \ncommunity involvement or character references. There is no evidence of unusual \ncircumstances when she committed the offenses. Instead, they were crimes of \nopportunity since she received a hard copy of her payroll check because the direct deposit \nsystem was down. She continues to deny knowledge or culpability in the matter of the \nfalse payroll checks. She has not been forthcoming and completely cooperative in the \n\n5 \n \nsecurity clearance application process. Her arrest was two years ago. Insufficient time \nhas elapsed without recidivism to conclude that her criminal behavior will not recur. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. \n \n          Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Most importantly, Applicant did not resolve the specific \nviolation alleged in the SOR, and she has not accepted responsibility for her crimes.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct remains a security concern. These offenses were not \nminor, and they were not committed under such unusual circumstances that they are \nunlikely to recur. Applicant minimized her termination for theft from her employer by \nstating that it was by mutual agreement for her to leave the job. She benefitted by a plea \ndeal arranged by her public defender to pay restitution, but she has yet to accept \nresponsibility or express remorse about the fraudulent check offenses. There is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has acknowledged the egregiousness of \nher behavior and she has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline J. \n  \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n\n6 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:                            Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn August 27, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 16 and October 18, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge (Answer).  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on \nFebruary 2, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 12, 2019, setting the \nhearing for February 26, 2019. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence. Applicant testified. After making a minor correction of a telephone \nnumber in GE 2 pursuant to Applicant\u2019s objection. All of the Government\u2019s exhibits were \nadmitted without further objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March \n6, 2019.  \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \n\u00b6 1.a to read as follows: \n \n \nYou committed an act of domestic violence against your children\u2019s mother \nin about July 2017. \n \nApplicant objected to the amendment because he said the date was wrong. I \ngranted the Motion to Amend. In response to my request that he answer the amended \nallegation, Applicant said he denied it and asserted the date was February 2017. (Tr. 9-\n11)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h. He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.b, and 2.c.

He graduated from high school and has \ntaken a couple college courses. He has a 12-year-old child and 10-year old child with a \nformer girlfriend (GF 1). He has a 9-year-old child and a 1-year-old child with his current \ngirlfriend (GF 2). He financially supports all of the children. He shares physical custody of \nthe older two children with GF 1. (Tr. 23-25)  \n \n \nApplicant is unemployed while awaiting the outcome of this proceeding. He had \nworked about six months for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a security \nclearance. Prior to that position, he had been a manager for retail stores for about 13 \nyears. (Tr. 25-27) \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) In October 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly \nconduct and breach of peace. The charge was dismissed. (Answer) He denied that he \nengaged in unlawful conduct before the arrest. (Tr. 29) \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) In November 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery-\ncause bodily harm, and theft-property, exerts unauthorized control. (Answer) At the time \nof the arrest, Applicant stated he became involved in a physical fight with his girlfriend\u2019s \ncousin. The cousin then broke into Applicant\u2019s car and stole some of Applicant\u2019s things. \nApplicant pleaded guilty to battery-cause bodily harm and was ordered to perform \ncommunity service. The theft charge was dismissed. (Tr. 31-33) \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) In September 2006, Applicant was charged with driving on a \nsuspended driver\u2019s license and driving 26-30 miles over the speed limit. (Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s license was suspended at the time because he had numerous unpaid parking \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ntickets that he could not afford to pay. (Tr. 33-34) The court\u2019s disposition is not in this \nrecord. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) In February 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with having an \nexpired driver\u2019s license for more than a year, and failure to reduce speed. (Answer) \nApplicant stated he did not know his license was expired when he was stopped by the \npolice. He was speeding because he was late for work. He said the case was dismissed \nafter he provided the court with evidence that his license was updated. (Tr. 34-36) This \nallegation is found in his favor.   \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) In February 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic \nbattery-bodily harm. (Answer) His neighbors called the police because he and GF 1 were \nin a heated verbal argument that became physical. He said he does not recall hitting or \ngrabbing GF 1. They were living together at the time. The case was dismissed because \nGF 1 refused to testify. (Tr. 36-39)   \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) In December 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving \nwithout a license, disregarding a stop sign, operating a car without insurance, and having \nan unregistered or expired registration. (Answer) He said that this incident occurred while \nhe was driving a friend\u2019s car, and he did not have his driver\u2019s license with him. All charges \nwere dismissed when Applicant went to court and produced evidence of his license, \ninsurance, and registration. (Tr. 41-42) This allegation is found in his favor.  \n \n \nIn February 2014, Applicant was in an automobile accident after he had a seizure \nwhile driving. He stopped driving later that year, as a consequence. He has epilepsy and \nis not allowed to drive. He has seizures once or twice a month. His last seizure was a \nmonth ago. He takes medication for the illness. (Tr. 42-44, 59-61) \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) In February 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic \nbattery-bodily harm. (Answer) Applicant was at GF 1\u2019s house at the time of the incident \nand became embroiled in an argument with her. He said GF 1 struck him, and he hit her \nin the face. He denied that he punched her in the face. He then took her phone, broke it, \nand smashed her windshield with a garbage can. The case was dismissed because GF \n1 refused to testify. (Tr. 44-47) \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) In July 2017, GF 1 called the police after she and Applicant got into \nan argument when he returned their two children to her home. She told the police that he \nspit at her during the conflict. The police filed an incident report regarding her complaint. \n(GE 5) GF 1 never signed a complaint, and the matter was dropped. Applicant said that \nthe incident never happened in July 2017. (Tr. 47-49) \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in treatment for domestic violence or anger \nmanagement. (Tr. 54) He said after the February 2017 incident, he began talking to his \npastor about his anger problems. He has counseled with him about 13 times. Applicant \nnow tries to walk away from situations that upset him. (Tr. 54-58) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n  \nIn August 2017, Applicant submitted his first security clearance application (SCA). \nIn response to Section 22, inquiring about his police record, he disclosed the February \n2014 car accident arrest, which was not alleged in the SOR. He also disclosed the \nFebruary 2017 incident (SOR \u00b6 1.b), stating that he had a \u201cdisagreement\u201d with GF 1. (GE \n1) He did not disclose that he struck her which he admitted during his testimony. (Tr. 44) \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose the July 2017 incident in Section 22, alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, because he denied any incident occurred in July 2017. (Tr. 47) Applicant denied that \nhe intentionally withheld information from the Government regarding the December 2012 \narrests for driving violations, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He said he did not disclose that incident \nbecause he thought the word charged meant convicted, and he was not convicted. (Tr. \n51-53; Answer)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 says that an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern related to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two may be potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nBased on credible evidence, Applicant has been arrested and/or charged with \ncriminal conduct on eight separate occasions between October 1998 and July 2017, \ndemonstrating a pattern of offenses that cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The evidence establishes the above two disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), (b), or (c). \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct spans 20 years, the last incident having occurred in July \n2017, less than two years ago. None of the criminal incidents occurred under unusual \ncircumstances. He was not pressured or coerced into committing any of the crimes or \nincidents. The evidence supporting the offenses is credible, including his admissions. \nThere is some evidence of rehabilitation. Applicant has counseled with his pastor about \n13 times about his anger management issues. However, that is insufficient evidence from \nwhich to conclude that he has adequately addressed his anger problems or is \nsuccessfully rehabilitated. AG \u00b6 32(d) minimally applies. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable \nin this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n\n \n \n \n \n7\naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant denied withholding information as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. He \nmaintained that he was not involved in an incident in July 2017 alleged in the amended \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He was not required to disclose the July 2017 incident, regardless of whether \nhe was confused about dates, because he was not arrested or charged with an offense \nat that time. He did not disclose the December 2012 vehicular offenses because he \nmisunderstood the question. He thought he was required to disclose convictions, not \ncharges. He disclosed sufficient information about the February 2017 incident to inform \nthe government about it. After listening to his testimony and reviewing the record, \nincluding all of his admissions and his disclosures of the February 2014 and February \n2017 incidents, I find that that he did not deliberately fail to disclose requested information. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c are found in his favor.   \n \nAlthough the offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e were dismissed by the court \nand are found in Applicant\u2019s favor under Guideline G, they are, when considered in \nconjunction with his history of other criminal offenses, demonstrate a lack of good \njudgment and an inability to comply with rules and regulations. The evidence establishes \na disqualify condition under AG \u00b6 16(c).     \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline and alleged in AG \u00b6 16(c).  \n \n (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of misconduct is not minor and did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances, as articulated under AG \u00b6 32(a) above. He has not participated in \nsufficient treatment or counseling to demonstrate that he is unlikely to repeat similar \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nbehaviors. The evidence is insufficient to establish mitigation under the above two \nconditions. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of criminal conduct \nthat spans a long period of time. The most serious incidents involved domestic violence \nwith his former girlfriend, which were not prosecuted because she refused to testify. \nApplicant displayed some remorse over his anger problem, but has not sufficiently \ndemonstrated that he has control over it and that similar conduct will not occur in the \nfuture. Overall, the evidence raises doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n   Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n            Against Applicant \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 1.c: \n \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 1.d: \n \n \n   Against Applicant \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 1.e: \n \n \n   For Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \n   Subparagraphs 1.f through1.g:  \n     Against Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 2.a: \n   \n \n      Against Applicant \n \n \n \n    Subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \n \n       For Applicant \n \n      \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

After reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on May 21, 2018, \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on June 1, 2018. She submitted a two-page statement explaining \nher financial problems, and she requested a decision based on the record in lieu of a \nhearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), submitting the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nJuly 19, 2018.

I also asked her for a recent statement of her debt \nmanagement program showing all the monthly payments or deposits that she had made \nsince July 2018, and whether she had paid or settled any accounts under the debt \nrepayment program. I gave Applicant until December 14, 2018, to supplement the \nrecord. I also asked Department Counsel for a recent copy of Applicant\u2019s credit report. \n(See Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1). I received, marked as HE 2, and included the recent credit \nreport in the record. Applicant failed to avail herself of the opportunity provided to \nsupplement the record. She did not object to my consideration of HE 2. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the remaining SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). Her \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2017. Applicant married in 1997 and divorced in 2004. She has \nfour children, ages 22, 19, 5, and 3.  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1993, and honorably served on active duty \nuntil she retired with the rank of E-6 in October 2013. Applicant has held a clearance \nsince at least 2004. After she retired, Applicant could not find a job and was \nunemployed until May 2014. Applicant has been working for federal contractors since \nMay 2014. Her current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, hired \nApplicant as an administrative assistant in October 2017. She requires the continuation \nof her clearance to retain her job eligibility. \n \nApplicant disclosed in her 2017 SCA that she had financial problems, including \ndelinquent personal loans in collection, garnishments of wages, debts over 120 days \ndelinquent, a foreclosed house, and delinquent accounts placed for collection or \ncharged off. Applicant explained that she suffered a severe financial hardship after she \nretired from the Navy because her only income was her retired pay and she was \nunemployed for about eight months. She was a single parent and the sole provider for \nher children, her mother, and her younger brother, both of whom came to live with her in \nOctober 2009. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was overwhelmed with her financial obligations and was unable to \nkeep up with her debts and her living expenses. Applicant claimed that she contacted \nsome of her creditors and collection agencies to let them know about her circumstances \nand to try to make payment arrangements; however, her creditors were unwilling to \ncooperate. \n \nIn her May 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that most of the SOR debts \nresulted from maintenance expenses for the house she owned at that time. She \nacknowledged responsibility for these debts and stated her intent to pay them off with \nthe assistance of a debt management company. She claimed to be financially stable \nand that she had not acquired any additional delinquent debts. She noted that she was \nmaking $1,375 a month on retirement income, $1,499 per month in disability income, \nabout $2,500 a month in wages from her current job, and $522 in child support. \n \nIn her August 2018 response to the FORM, Applicant stated that since receiving \nher SOR she enrolled in a debt management program. She anticipated paying off the \ndelinquent accounts in 42 months. Applicant noted that her financial situation has \nimproved significantly. She explained that the only reason she did not address the debts \nsooner was because she was under the mistaken belief that after the debts were \ncharged off, there was nothing else she could do about them. After discussing her debts \nwith the debt management company, she claimed to have taken the necessary steps to \nresolve her delinquent debts. Applicant presented no documentary evidence of her \ncontract with a debt management company, of the debts included in the contract, of any \npayments made to her creditors or to the debt management company. \n \nThe status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a credit card debt, and she owes $5,342 that was charged-off \nin 2012. Applicant admitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any \nefforts to contact the creditor, settle, or pay the debt. This debt is unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a credit card debt, and she owes $4,680 that was charged-off. \nApplicant admitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to \ncontact the creditor, settle, or pay the debt. This debt is unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged a credit card debt, and she owes $4,504 that was charged off. \nThe November 2018 credit report shows that Applicant is paying under a partial \npayment agreement. The debt is in the process of being resolved, and it is mitigated. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a credit card debt, and she owes $2,148 that was charged off. \nApplicant admitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to \ncontact the creditor, settle, or pay the debt. This debt is unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a credit card debt, and she owes $659 that was charged off. \nApplicant admitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to \ncontact the creditor, settle, or pay the debt. This debt is unresolved.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged a credit card debt, and she owes $516 that was charged off. \nApplicant admitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to \ncontact the creditor, settle, or pay the debt. This debt is unresolved.  \n \nApplicant stated that she is current on her more recent accounts, and pays her \ndebts on time following a budget. She noted that her brother has a job and contributes \nto the household finances. Her mother receives social security disability payments and \nalso contributes to the household finances and takes care of the children when \nApplicant is working. Her daughter just graduated from high school with honors, has a \npart-time job and also contributes to the household finances. Applicant contributes to \ntwo 401K retirement plans, holding approximately $5,200 and $1,800. She is currently \nenrolled in college and working on her bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant\u2019s August 2018 \nfinancial analysis states that her monthly income is $6,435; her monthly expenses total \n$3,669; and she has $2,766 of monthly disposable income. \n \nApplicant repeatedly stated that she is not a security risk. She noted her military \nservice and her love for the Navy, the United States, and her job. She claimed she has \nlearned from her past mistakes and promised not to repeat the same financial mistakes. \nShe averred that she has been working hard to resolve her financial problems. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \nimplemented by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, which are effective June \n8, 2017, which are applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, \n2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. Between \n2010 and 2018, she accumulated six delinquent accounts that were in collection or \ncharged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201d(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the above disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;1 and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nSome of the financial considerations mitigating conditions are partially raised by \nthe facts in this case; however, they do not mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable, but does not mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment, particularly as the sole provider for her children, mother, and sibling, is \na circumstance beyond her control that likely contributed to her financial problems. \nRetirement from the military is inevitable for anyone serving beyond 20 years, and thus \nher retirement cannot be considered as a circumstance beyond her control. \nNevertheless, she has been employed since 2014, and submitted little evidence to \nestablish that she was financially responsible under the circumstances after she \nbecame employed. \n \n \nApplicant should have been more diligent addressing her delinquent debts \nsooner, contacting her creditors, and paying her debts. She served in the Navy 20 \nyears, and has held a clearance since at least 2004. Her service experience and \nfamiliarity with the security clearance process placed Applicant on notice that her \nfinancial problems created a security concern.  \n \n \nApplicant promised to take care of her financial problems and claimed she had \nattempted to contact her creditors and tried to establish payment agreements. She also \nclaimed that she retained the services of a debt resolution company to assist her \nresolving her delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence fell short of \ncorroborating her claims of financial responsibility or that she retained the services of a \ndebt resolution company to help her address her delinquent accounts.  \n \n \nApplicant presented limited evidence to show that she participated in financial \ncounseling or that she is following a working budget. Her documentary evidence is \ninsufficient to show that her financial problem is being resolved and that her finances \nare under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because \nshe presented no evidence of disputed accounts. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant, 43, served in the Navy on active duty for 20 years and has been \nemployed with Federal contractors since 2014. She has held a clearance since 2004 \nthat has been continued to present. Her evidence is insufficient to demonstrate financial \nresponsibility and she failed to mitigate the financial considerations concerns.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more effort towards documented resolution of her delinquent debts, a \nhealthy financial picture, and a track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, \nshe may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance \nworthiness. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn by the Government. \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \neligibility for a security clearance to Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/31/2019 \n__________ \n \nRemand Decision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that she has been financially \nresponsible, and that her financial problems are being resolved or are under control. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 3, 2017. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on May 21, 2018, \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on June 1, 2018. She submitted a two-page statement explaining her \nfinancial problems, and she requested a decision based on the record in lieu of a hearing. \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), submitting the \nevidence supporting the security concerns alleged in the SOR, was provided to Applicant \nby letter dated July 19, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on August 1, 2018. She was \nallowed 30 days to submit any objections to the FORM and to provide material to refute, \nextenuate, and mitigate the concerns. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) received Applicant\u2019s FORM response on August 27, 2018. The case was \n\n \n2 \n \n \nassigned to me on October 11, 2018. Lacking any objections, I admitted and considered \nthe Government\u2019s proposed evidence and Applicant\u2019s FORM response. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nThe motion was granted as requested. \n \nBy email dated November 29, 2018, I reopened the record and gave Applicant the \nopportunity to supplement the record with documentary evidence of her efforts to \ncommunicate with creditors, of any payments made, or of payment agreements \nestablished with her creditors. I also asked her for the most recent statement of her debt \nmanagement program showing all the monthly payments or deposits that she had made \nsince July 2018, and whether she had paid or settled any accounts under the debt \nrepayment program. I gave Applicant until December 14, 2018, to supplement the record. \nI also asked Department Counsel to submit a recent copy of Applicant\u2019s credit report. \n(See Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1). I received, marked as HE 2, and included the recent credit \nreport in the record.  \n \nBecause of technical difficulties within the DOHA information technology system, \nneither Department Counsel nor I received Applicant\u2019s answer to my November 29, 2018 \nemail requesting additional information. In fact, Applicant replied to my request for \ninformation the same day of my request, and attached two documents to her email: (1) a \ntwo-page document with the heading of \u201cMy Creditors,\u201d and (2) a one-page document, \nwith the heading of \u201cBanking.\u201d Both documents and a series of emails between Applicant, \nDepartment Counsel, and myself are marked as HE 3 and have been made part of the \nrecord. In the correspondence, Applicant confirmed those were the only documents she \nsubmitted. \n \nI denied Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance without having the opportunity to \nconsider the two documents she submitted on February 2, 2019. Applicant appealed and \nnoted that she timely complied with my request for information and that I did not consider \nthe information she provided. On May 13, 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the \ncase for me to consider the evidence Applicant attempted to submit prior to the closing of \nthe record and to issue a new decision. I considered Applicant\u2019s and the Government\u2019s \nnew evidence in this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the remaining SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). Her \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2017. Applicant married in 1997 and divorced in 2004. She has four \nchildren, ages 22, 19, 5, and 3.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1993, and honorably served on active duty \nuntil she retired with the rank of E-6 in October 2013. Applicant has held a clearance \nsince at least 2004. After she retired, Applicant could not find a job and was unemployed \nuntil May 2014 (about eight months). Applicant has been working for federal contractors \nsince May 2014. Her current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, hired \nApplicant as an administrative assistant in October 2017. She requires the continuation \nof her clearance to retain her job eligibility. \n \nApplicant disclosed in her 2017 SCA that she had financial problems, including \ndelinquent personal loans in collection, garnishments of wages, debts over 120 days \ndelinquent, a foreclosed house, and delinquent accounts placed for collection or charged \noff. Applicant explained that she suffered a severe financial hardship after she retired from \nthe Navy because her only income was her retired pay and she was unemployed for about \neight months. She was a single parent and the sole provider for her children, her mother, \nand her younger brother. Her mother and brother came to live with her in October 2009. \n \nApplicant was overwhelmed with her financial obligations and was unable to keep \nup with her debts and her living expenses. Applicant claimed that she contacted some of \nher creditors and collection agencies to let them know about her circumstances and to try \nto make payment arrangements; however, her creditors were unwilling to cooperate. \n \nIn her June 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that most of the SOR debts \nresulted from maintenance expenses for the house she owned at that time. She \nacknowledged responsibility for these debts and stated her intent to pay them off with the \nassistance of a debt management company. She claimed to be financially stable and that \nshe had not acquired any additional delinquent debts. She noted that she was making \n$1,375 a month on retirement income, $1,499 per month in disability income, about \n$2,500 a month in wages from her current job, and $522 in child support. Her gross \nmonthly earnings were about $5,896.00. \n \nIn her August 2018 response to the FORM, Applicant stated that since receiving \nher SOR she enrolled in a debt management program. She anticipated paying off the \ndelinquent accounts in 42 months. Applicant noted that her financial situation has \nimproved significantly. She explained that the only reason she did not address the debts \nsooner was because she was under the mistaken belief that after the debts were charged \noff, there was nothing else she could do about them. After discussing her debts with the \ndebt management company, she claimed to have taken the necessary steps to resolve \nher delinquent debts.  \n \nBetween 1999 and 2013, the Applicant accumulated six delinquent accounts that \nwere in collection or charged off as of the date of the SOR. The status of the debts alleged \nin the SOR is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a credit-card debt, owing $5,342 that was charged-off in 2012. \nApplicant admitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontact the creditor, settle, or pay the debt before August 2018. Apparently, she submitted \nthis account to her debt management company and the account is \u201cin negotiation\u201d status \n(in the process of being negotiated for less than what is owed). The account is unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a credit-card debt, owing $4,680 that was charged-off. Applicant \nadmitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to contact the \ncreditor, settle, or pay the debt before August 2018. Apparently, she submitted this \naccount to her debt management company and the account is \u201cin a structured settlement\u201d \nstatus (in a payment plan for less what it is owed). She presented no evidence of any \npayments made or payment agreements established to resolve the account. The \nNovember 2018 credit report shows the account as charged off. This debt is unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged a credit-card debt, owing $4,504 that was charged off. The \nNovember 2018 credit report shows that Applicant is paying under a partial payment \nagreement. The debt is in the process of being resolved, and it is mitigated. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a credit-card debt, owing $2,148 that was charged off. Applicant \nadmitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to contact the \ncreditor, settle, or pay the debt. This debt is unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a credit-card debt, owing $659 that was charged off. Applicant \nadmitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to contact the \ncreditor, settle, or pay the debt before August 2018. Apparently, she submitted this \naccount to her debt management company and the account is \u201cin negotiation\u201d status. The \naccount is reflected as charged off in the November 2018 credit report. She presented no \nevidence of any payments made or payment agreements established to resolve the \naccount. This debt is unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged a credit-card debt, owing $516 that was charged off. Applicant \nadmitted this debt. She presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to contact the \ncreditor, settle, or pay the debt before August 2018. Apparently, she submitted this \naccount to her debt management company and the account is \u201cin negotiation\u201d status. The \naccount is reflected as charged off in the November 2018 credit report. She presented no \nevidence of any payments made or payment agreements established to resolve the \naccount. This debt is unresolved.  \n \nApplicant stated that she is current on her more recent accounts, and pays her \ndebts on time following a budget. She noted that her brother has a job and contributes to \nthe household finances. Her mother receives social security disability payments, \ncontributes to the household finances, and takes care of the children when Applicant is \nworking. Her daughter just graduated from high school with honors, has a part-time job, \nand also contributes to the household finances. Applicant contributes to two 401K \nretirement plans, holding approximately $5,200 and $1,800. She is currently enrolled in \ncollege and working on her bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant\u2019s August 2018 financial analysis \nstates that her monthly income is $6,435; her monthly expenses total $3,669; and she \nhas $2,766 of monthly disposable income. Having that much disposable income, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant failed to explain the lack of evidence showing efforts to resolve the delinquent \naccounts since the SOR was issued in May 2018. \n \nApplicant repeatedly stated that she is not a security risk. She highlighted her \nhonorable military service and her love for the Navy, the United States, and her job. She \nclaimed she has learned from her past financial mistakes and promised not to repeat \nthem. She averred that she has been working hard to resolve her financial problems. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, \n1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), implemented \nby Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, which are effective June 8, 2017, which \nare applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \n\n \n6 \n \n \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. Between \n1999 and 2013, she accumulated six delinquent accounts that were in collection or \ncharged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201d(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the above disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n7 \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;1 and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue.\nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. \n24, 2013).  \nSome of the financial considerations mitigating conditions are partially raised by \nthe facts in this case; however, they do not mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis partially applicable, but does not mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment, particularly as the sole provider for her children, mother, and sibling, is a \ncircumstance beyond her control that likely contributed to her financial problems. \nRetirement from the military is inevitable for anyone serving beyond 20 years, and thus \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nher retirement cannot be considered as a circumstance beyond her control. Nevertheless, \nshe has been employed since 2014, and submitted little evidence to establish that she \nwas financially responsible under the circumstances after she became employed. \n \n \nApplicant should have been more diligent addressing her delinquent debts sooner, \ncontacting her creditors, and paying her debts. Other than submitting her delinquent \naccounts to a debt resolution company in August 2018, Applicant submitted little evidence \nof any contacts with creditors, of any payments made, or of any payment agreements \nestablished to resolve her debts. She served in the Navy 20 years, and has held a \nclearance since at least 2004. Her service experience and familiarity with the security \nclearance process placed Applicant on notice that her financial problems created a \nsecurity concern.  \n \n \nApplicant promised to take care of her financial problems and claimed her finances \nare now stable because she has been employed since 2014. Her August 2018 financial \nanalysis states that her monthly income is $6,435; her monthly expenses total $3,669; \nand that she has $2,766 of monthly disposable income. With little evidence of payments \nmade towards her delinquent accounts, Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence fell short of \ncorroborating her claims of financial responsibility or of good-faith efforts to resolve her \ndelinquent accounts.  \n \n \nApplicant presented limited evidence to show that she participated in financial \ncounseling or that she is following a working budget. Her documentary evidence is \ninsufficient to show that her financial problem is being resolved and that her finances are \nunder control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because she \npresented no evidence of disputed accounts. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F \nin my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 43, served in the Navy on active duty for 20 years and has been \nemployed with Federal contractors since 2014. She has held a clearance since 2004. Her \nevidence is insufficient to demonstrate financial responsibility, and she failed to mitigate \nthe financial considerations concerns.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary to become eligible for a security clearance in \nthe future. With more effort towards documented resolution of her delinquent debts, a \nhealthy financial picture, and a track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nshe may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance \nworthiness. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn by the Government. \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance to Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old. He has been married since 1995. He has two daughters, ages 23 and 21. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He has held a DOD security clearance since approximately 1997. He has been employed as an aviation project lead for a federal contractor since September 2007. His current salary is about $85,000, and his wife\u2019s annual salary is about $30,000. (Tr. 13-16) Applicant and his spouse currently live in his parents\u2019 home. His parents have agreed to allow them to live in their home for free until both of their granddaughters have graduated from college. Applicant pays rent for his two adult daughters, one who graduated from college in May 2018, and the younger one, now a senior in college. He estimated that he pays approximately $3,000 total each month for their rent, utilities, and food. He also pays for insurance on four cars, and for his daughters\u2019 cell phone service. He recently started paying $210 a month for his oldest daughter\u2019s student loan, which became due shortly after her 2018 college graduation. He is paying this amount currently until his daughter is established and can start paying for her student loans.

Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 12, \n2016. On May 29, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 18, 2018, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On October 29, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On \n04/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDecember 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of Hearing, setting the hearing for January 15, 2019. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, but \ndid not offer any documentation into evidence. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the \nrecord open until February 15, 2019. On January 22, 2019, Applicant offered three \ndocuments, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, B, and C, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 25, 2019. The \nrecord closed on February 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations cited as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old. He has been married since 1995. \nHe has two daughters, ages 23 and 21. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He \nhas held a DOD security clearance since approximately 1997. He has been employed \nas an aviation project lead for a federal contractor since September 2007. His current \nsalary is about $85,000, and his wife\u2019s annual salary is about $30,000. (Tr. 13-16)  \n \nApplicant and his spouse currently live in his parents\u2019 home. His parents have \nagreed to allow them to live in their home for free until both of their granddaughters \nhave graduated from college. Applicant pays rent for his two adult daughters, one who \ngraduated from college in May 2018, and the younger one, now a senior in college. He \nestimated that he pays approximately $3,000 total each month for their rent, utilities, \nand food. He also pays for insurance on four cars, and for his daughters\u2019 cell phone \nservice. He recently started paying $210 a month for his oldest daughter\u2019s student loan, \nwhich became due shortly after her 2018 college graduation. He is paying this amount \ncurrently until his daughter is established and can start paying for her student loans. (Tr. \n20-23, 41-42, 49)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.a that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March \n2013. His liabilities totaled approximately $250,603. The bankruptcy was discharged in \nApril 2018. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are attributed to a real estate business his \nspouse started in approximately 2007. They also purchased a more expensive home \nthat year, anticipating a second income from his spouse. Within a year or two, her real \nestate career ended after her business failed during the housing market crisis. In \naddition, in approximately 2010, his daughter suffered a sports-related injury, which \nrequired three surgeries. Without the anticipated income from his spouse, Applicant \nadmitted they were living beyond their means. They started using credit cards to pay for \ntheir food and other living expenses. All of these factors contributed to Applicant\u2019s \ndecision to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2013. He made monthly payments to the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbankruptcy trustee through payroll deduction until the bankruptcy was successfully \ndischarged in 2018. (Tr. 24-29, 31-32; GE 2)  \n \n The SOR alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-e, four student loans referred for collection with the \nDepartment of Education (DOE), with a combined total of $22,799. Applicant was a \nproject lead with his employer working on DOD contracts. One of the DOD contracts \nrequired all project leads to have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant only had an associate\u2019s \ndegree. He took college classes online and graduated with his bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2016. He took out student loans every semester for two years beginning in January \n2014 to pay for his classes. Two years of his Federal tax refunds were intercepted to \npay the outstanding balance of his student loans. Beginning in June 2018, he started a \nrehabilitation loan agreement where he is to pay $329 a month for 11 consecutive \nmonths to rehabilitate his student loans. After his April 2019 payment, his loan will be \nconsidered rehabilitated and he can negotiate with the creditor for a lower monthly \npayment. Applicant\u2019s monthly payments are automatically deducted from his bank \naccount. He provided a copy of his student loan rehabilitation agreement on January 22, \n2019.  (Tr. 34-41, 48-49; AE A) \n \nThe last delinquent debt alleged in the SOR (\u00b6 1.f) is a medical account in the \namount of $147. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he stated he was unaware of this \naccount until the SOR was issued. In June 2018, he paid this account in full. He did not \nprovide supporting documentation with his SOR response or during his hearing. \nApplicant provided a copy of his receipt on January 22, 2019. (Tr. 42-43; AE B) \n \nApplicant and his spouse established a revised monthly budget in January 2019 \nafter taking financial planning classes through their church. His youngest daughter will \ngraduate from college in May 2019, and she expects to start working immediately \nthereafter. He expects a substantial decrease in their monthly expenses after they no \nlonger have to pay her monthly expenses. With the new budget, Applicant\u2019s income \ncovers all of the monthly expenses. They use a cash envelope system which works well \nfor them and prevents use of credit cards to pay for monthly bills. His wife pays for the \nfamily health insurance through her employment. Her monthly net pay is approximately \n$800, which they have been putting into a savings account. Applicant provided a copy \nof their monthly budget on January 22, 2019. (Tr. 50-52; AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties beginning in 2007, with the startup and \nsubsequent failure of his wife\u2019s real estate business, unexpected medical bills for his \ndaughter\u2019s surgeries, and the added expense of putting his two daughters through \ncollege. Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2013, and made monthly payments to \nthe trustee, until it was successfully discharged in 2018. He accumulated over $26,000 \nin student loans for his online college classes to keep his current position with his \nemployer. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, such as his wife\u2019s business failure and his \ndaughter\u2019s unexpected medical expenses, were circumstances that were beyond his \ncontrol. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, and he made consistent \npayments to the bankruptcy trustee until his bankruptcy was discharged in 2018. In \nJune 2018, he entered into a student loan rehabilitation agreement with the DOE for his \noutstanding student loans in the amount of $26,000. He has consistently made his \nmonthly installments in accordance with the agreement, and his student loans will be \nrehabilitated in April 2019. He immediately paid a delinquent medical debt that he had \nnot known existed. He has taken financial planning classes through his church, and \nrevised his monthly budget in January 2019. He is taking responsible action to reduce \nhis indebtedness and monthly expenses. Applicant\u2019s debt arose under such \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur, and he is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \nhis outstanding student loans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), and (d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an individual \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a position of trust with the Government. The \nGovernment does not require Applicant to be debt-free, but he is required to manage \nhis finances in such a way as to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and has worked for his present employer since \nSeptember 2007. He has held a DOD security clearance since approximately 1997. He \nhas taken responsible action to address his debts, which arose under circumstances \nbeyond his control. Applicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates his good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concern arising under the financial \nconsiderations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nPamela C.

He should have been more diligent addressing his \ndelinquent accounts. Notwithstanding, his financial problems are being resolved and are \nunder control. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his first security clearance application (SCA) on March 24, \n2017, seeking eligibility for a clearance required for his position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) on May \n28, 2018. He answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 10, 2018.  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on January 16, 2019. The Notice of Hearing\n(NOH) was issued on April 16, 2019, setting a hearing for May 14, 2019. At the hearing,\nthe Government offered five exhibits (GE 1 through 5). GE 1 through GE 5 were\nadmitted into evidence without objection. GE 6 was marked for administrative purposes.\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant testified, presented his wife\u2019s testimony, and submitted six exhibits. (AE A \nthrough F), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 5, 2019. \nProcedural Issue \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. I granted the motion as requested. (Tr. 7) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the financial allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.e). After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1994, completed an associate\u2019s degree in 2002, and continued to take \ncollege courses until 2016, but has not earned another degree. He married in 2000, and \nhas two stepdaughters, ages 31 and 27, and a son and a daughter, ages 18 and 15.  \nApplicant\u2019s employment record in his SCA shows that he has been, except as \naddress below, continually employed since December 2008. Applicant worked for his \ncurrent employer and security sponsor between April 2012 and October 2015. He was \nlaid off and unemployed between October 2015 and February 2016. He was rehired and \nhas been working for his current employer since February 2016. (GE 1 and 2) He is an \ninformation technology systems engineer and his job requires him to be away from \nhome about six months of the year.  \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he has been unemployed or underemployed \nseveral times: in 2001 for about eight months; in 2008 for about six months; and in 2014 \nfor about six weeks. He could not explain the discrepancies between his 2017 SCA \nwork history and his hearing testimony.  \nIn his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had financial problems that included \nan April 2010 judgment filed against him for $419; two over-120-day delinquent debts \nthat were in collection for $19,935 and $1,206 related to a timeshare that he purchased \nin 2012 and its related maintenance fees; a 2015 medical debt for $261 that he recently \npaid; and a 2015 collection for $1,212 that he was disputing.  \nApplicant was interviewed by a background investigator in July 2017. (GE 2) He \ndiscussed with the investigator all of the accounts and the judgment alleged in the SOR. \nHe stated that he was disputing all the SOR accounts and the judgment. He believed \nthat his financial problems resulted from circumstances beyond his control. Applicant \ntold the investigator that in 2009 he financially supported his in-laws for a period; was \nlaid off and unemployed between December 2008 and January 2009; and had two \nvehicles that broke down and required expensive repairs. He explained that he took out \n\n \n3 \n \n \na personal loan in 2008 for $4,500 from a bank. He defaulted on the loan in 2009 \nbecause he was laid off and could not catch up with his bills. As a result, between June \n2013 and June 2014, Applicant had one-third of his pay garnished to satisfy the \ndefaulted loan. (GE 2) \nApplicant and his wife took an eight-day vacation trip to another country in \nJanuary 2012. (Tr. 109-110) They were enticed to travel at a discounted fare in \nexchange for their attendance at a timeshare sales presentation. They fell victims to the \ntimeshare personnel pressure-sales tactics and bought a timeshare. He told the \ninvestigator that he attempted to return the timeshare (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for a refund during \nthe contractual 90-day refund period, but could not get in contact with the company for \nsix months. By then, it was too late for any reconciliation. (GE 2) \nAt hearing, Applicant\u2019s testimony contradicted his statement to the investigator in \n2017. He testified that the timeshare salesperson and the purchase contract stated that \nhe could rescind the contract and receive a refund within one-year of the purchase date. \n(Tr. 72-74) He claimed that he tried numerous times within the year period to contact \nthe timeshare sales personnel by phone and in writing without success. He averred that \naround November-December 2012, the timeshare company stopped withdrawing the \nmortgage payments from his bank account. He believed that indicated the timeshare \ncontract was rescinded and the issue was resolved. He claimed he was not aware that \nthe account was in collection until sometime in 2015 when he reviewed a credit report \nwhile refinancing his home.  \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence to substantiate his claims of \nhaving a one-year contract rescission and refund clause, or of his efforts to contact the \ntimeshare personnel or of any correspondence to address the debt since he acquired \nthe timeshare in 2012. Applicant testified he paid a total of $7,000 during the first year \nhe owned the timeshare, but he presented no evidence of efforts to request a refund of \nhis money after the alleged cancellation of the contract in late 2012.  \n \nConcerning the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant provided the \ninvestigator with two documents the investigator described as \u201can investigation \nsummary and resolution summary through TransUnion\u2019s Online Dispute Services.\u201d \nThese two documents described by the investigator are not part of the Government\u2019s or \nApplicant\u2019s evidence. According to the investigator, the documents showed that the \naccount was successfully disputed and removed from Applicants credit report on July \n12, 2017, by the Circuit Court of the County where the judgment was filed in August \n2010. According to the investigator, the court deleted the account due to multiple \ninaccuracies of the data and the account being more than seven years old. \n \nApplicant told the investigator that he believed the debt stemmed from his son\u2019s \nformer private school tuition fees. He stated that his spouse removed their son from the \nprivate school because she decided to homeschool him. Because the child was \nremoved from school before the school year was completed, the school charged them \nwith the tuition fees for the year. Applicant told the investigator that he did not disclose \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe judgment in his March 2017 SCA because he was unaware of the debt until his July \n2017 interview.  \n \nApplicant testified that he first became aware of the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b when reviewing a credit report while refinancing his home in 2015. He and his wife \ntestified that they pulled their son from the private school because he had special needs \nthe school could not address. He testified that they had a meeting with school \nadministrative personnel, and they agreed not to charge them for his son\u2019s remaining \ntuition fees. Applicant repeatedly averred that he was never given notice of the \ncollection suit filed against him, that he never had the opportunity to go in front of a \ncourt to dispute the collection, and that he was never notified that a judgment was filed \nagainst him. (Tr. 92-95)  \nApplicant told the investigator that he did not recognize the account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. He believed the account was likely a duplicate of the account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, in collection by a different collection agency. I find this explanation plausible. \nApplicant claimed he found about the account for the first time in 2015, and disputed it \nin June 2016. His dispute was successful and the account was removed from his credit \nreport. The account is not reflected in Applicant\u2019s current credit reports. Applicant \ntestified that he does not feel responsible for the debt because the creditor or the \ncollection agency cannot prove the debt belonged to him or that they have the right to \ncollect it. He claimed he would pay it if they were able to produce evidence that it is his \ndebt. (Tr. 115-116) \nApplicant and his wife took an 11-day vacation trip to a foreign country at the cost \nof about $3,000 in 2016. (Tr. 112-113) At the time, he was already aware of all the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e. Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments made, payment agreements established, or \ncommunications with any of the creditors for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.e. \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly take-home pay is about $4,800. He has about \n$60,000 in a savings account and $65,000 in his 401k retirement plan. Applicant \ntestified that he no longer has a financial problem. He and his wife live within their \nfinancial means and do not spend what you do not have. They follow the Dave \nRamsey\u2019s budget theory of having savings for when hard times arise. To resolve their \nfinancial problems, they paid their smallest debt first and continued to pay the debts one \nby one. They do not use credit cards, and currently have no car payments. The credit \nreports in evidence show that he and his wife paid other accounts not alleged in the \nSOR. Applicant believes that he is diligent, responsible, and takes his finances and \ndebts seriously. He believes his financial house is currently in order and that with his \ncurrent income, his financial situation is now stable. He believes that he will be able to \nmaintain his financial responsibility and eligibility for a clearance. \nApplicant submitted six reference statements from supervisors, coworkers, and \nfriends. He is considered to be reliable, dedicated, trustworthy, and a good role model. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nHe displays good judgment and is committed to the United States. His references \nendorsed his eligibility for a clearance. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. AG \u00b6 19 \nprovides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions, requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or in under control; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised, in part, \nby the facts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant developed \nfinancial problems, partially, because of circumstances beyond his control in 2009, \nwhich included periods of unemployment, providing financial support for his in-laws, \nexpensive vehicle repairs, and he being the sole provider for his family. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, and they do not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nConcerning the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant documented to the \ninvestigator that the account was successfully disputed and removed from Applicants \ncredit report on July 12, 2017. According to the investigator, the court deleted the \naccount due to multiple inaccuracies and the account being more than seven years old. \nI find this allegation for Applicant. \n \nThe account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d appears to be a duplicate of the account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, in collection by a different collection agency. Considering the \nevidence as a whole, I find this explanation plausible and find SOR \u00b6 1.d for Applicant. \n \nI also find for Applicant on the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. Applicant \nand his wife were enticed to travel to another country at a discounted fare in exchange \nfor their attendance at a timeshare sales presentation. They fell prey to the high-\npressure sales tactics and purchased a timeshare beyond their financial means. \nSubsequently, the timeshare sales personnel became unavailable and he was unable to \nrescind the purchase contract within the 90-day period allowed.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts are somewhat lacking, except for disputing \nthe accounts. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s resolution of his past financial problems and \nhis present financial posture show diligence and responsibility in the handling of his \nfinancial obligations. He is following a solid source of financial counseling and he has a \nbudget. He has not acquired additional delinquent debt. Considering the evidence as a \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhole, Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. He credibly promised to maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. His earnings should be sufficient to pay for his family\u2019s living \nexpenses and current debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. This is his first SCA. \nHe has worked for his current employer since 2012. He should have been more diligent \naddressing his delinquent accounts. Notwithstanding, his financial problems are being \nresolved and are under control. Because of the security clearance process, he is fully \naware of the security concerns that would be raised by his failure to maintain financial \nresponsibility. He promised to maintain his financial responsibility. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nWITHDRAWN  \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant.

National security eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn June 11, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR in writing on \nJune 26, 2018 (Answer), and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on October 3, \n2018. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 18, 2018, setting the hearing for \nNovember 6, 2018. The hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into evidence. Applicant testified, called one \nwitness, and offered Exhibits (AE) A and B into evidence. All exhibits were admitted. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 15, 2018. The record remained \nopen until December 21, 2018, to permit submission of additional evidence. Applicant \n01/31/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\ntimely submitted exhibits that she marked as AE 1 through 4. They are admitted without \nobjection from Department Counsel. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. She denied \nthose in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings. \n. \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and never married. She has a 14-year-old daughter, \nwhom she supports. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988 and a master\u2019s degree in \n1998. She began working for her current employer, a defense contractor, in September \n2017. (Tr. 17-22) \n \n \nApplicant earns $106,000 annually. Prior to this position, she worked for another \nfederal contractor from June 2016 to September 2017 and earned $68,000 a year. She \nwas unemployed from December 2015 to June 2016, after being laid off by a federal \ncontractor for whom she worked from October 2012 to December 2015. She earned \n$90,000 annually during those three years. (Tr. 22-23; GE 1) \n \n \nBased on a credit bureau report (CBR) from November 2017, the SOR alleged \nseven financial security concerns: a 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy; a state tax debt; a retail \nstore debt; an electric bill; an automobile repossession; a foreclosed mortgage; and a \ntollway debt. The debts accumulated between 2016 and 2017 and totaled $28,133. (GE \n3) The status of each allegation is as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant\u2019s financial problems were exacerbated when she was laid off \nin 2015 and unable to pay her bills. (Tr. 26) In October 2015, she filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in an effort to save her home from foreclosure.1 The case was dismissed in \nApril 2016 because she was unable to make the payments as a result of the layoff. None \nof the debts included in the bankruptcy were discharged. (Tr. 24-29)  \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: The $3,000 state tax debt from 2003 is unresolved. Applicant admitted \nthat she owed the debt. (Answer) She said she tried to negotiate a resolution a year ago, \nbut could not afford the state\u2019s offer. On the morning of this hearing, November 6, 2018, \nshe made a $310 payment on a repayment plan she established, which requires her to \nmake monthly payments of $60. This debt was included in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy. \nApplicant said she had been disputing this debt for years. (Tr. 29-33, 63, 73; GE 2; AE A) \nPost-hearing, she submitted a document indicating that the debt was deleted from her \ncredit report. However, that document is insufficient to prove that she paid the debt or is \nno longer responsible for it, given her admissions and the documentary evidence \nindicating that it is her debt. (AE 1) This debt is unresolved. \n \n                                            \n1 The bankruptcy petition included $37,523 in accounts, including $29,000 of student loans. It also recorded \na $3,000 state tax debt. (GE 2) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: This $841 delinquent debt is owed to a retail store for a 2015 purchase. \nApplicant credibly stated that she did not owe it and had notified the store that she had \nreturned an item in question. She hired a credit repair company to dispute it. (Tr. 34-37) \nIt was removed from her credit report in December 2018. (AE 1) This debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: The $110 unpaid electric bill is resolved. Applicant credibly said she \npaid it in 2017. (Tr. 38-39) It was removed from her credit report in January 2018. (AE 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant admitted that she owed the $18,932 debt for an automobile \nrepossession. (Answer) She purchased a $26,000 car in May 2013 and stopped making \npayments in 2015 after her layoff. She never made a subsequent payment on the debt. \nShe spoke to the creditor in July 2018 about resolving it. She was unable to settle the \ndebt for $8,000, as offered by the creditor, because she did not have enough money. A \nweek prior to this hearing, she contacted an attorney to inquire about resolving the debt. \n(Tr. 39-43) It is unresolved.  \n \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: In December 2009, Applicant purchased a home. Between 2012 and \n2013, she had difficulty paying her monthly $2,000 mortgage payment and the $460 \nhomeowner\u2019s assessment. She subsequently obtained a loan modification that resulted \nin a minor decrease in the monthly payment in 2013. In October 2015, the bank foreclosed \non the property. In January 2017, the bank completed the foreclosure, sold the property, \nand gave Applicant $2,000 as a payoff. (Tr. 24-29) This allegation is resolved. \n \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: In August 2018, Applicant established a payment plan to resolve a \n$5,250 debt owed to a county for unpaid fines and tolls from 2016 and 2017. She agreed \nto begin making monthly payments of $225 in August 2018. As of that date, the debt\u2019s \nbalance was listed as $2,791.2 She testified that she had not made the October 2018 \npayment. (Tr. 43-26; AE B) This debt is unresolved.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a budget. Her net monthly income is $6,200. Her expenses \nare $5,455, and include a $60 payment for her state tax debt; a $100 payment on the \ntollway debt; and a $65 payment to the Internal Revenue Service for a 2016 Federal tax \ndebt of $4,000. She started that payment plan a month ago.3 She recently consolidated \nher student loans and was scheduled to make monthly payments of $195 toward that \ndebt. She made a payment in October 2018. Her student loans total $28,000. She has \nabout $745 remaining at the end of the month that she uses for other expenses. She has \nnot participated in credit or budget counseling. (Tr. 49-52, 58, 72-74; AE 4)   \n \n \n \nA human resources (HR) individual from Applicant\u2019s employer testified. He knows \nthat this proceeding involves Applicant\u2019s finances, but has not reviewed the SOR. He has \n                                            \n2It is not clear why there is a difference in alleged balance and listed balance on the county\u2019s document.  \n  \n3 The SOR did not allege the Federal tax debt for 2016 as a security concern. Thus, it will not be considered \nin analyzing disqualifying conditions. It may be considered in the analysis of mitigating conditions and the \nwhole-person concept, and an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility.   \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nknown Applicant for over a year. He said she has been a successful member of her team. \nHe had nothing negative to report. (Tr. 76-79) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD after on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:   \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns. Four may apply \nin this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f)  failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties that began between 2012 and 2013 \nwhen she started experiencing problems paying her mortgage. In 2015, she filed a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy that was dismissed six months later because she was unable to \nmake payments. Subsequently, the bank foreclosed on her property. She has an unpaid \nstate tax debt, a county tollway debt, and an unresolved automobile repossession debt. \nShe had two smaller debts. The financial problems are documented by her admissions, \na CBR, and other evidence. Other than the utility debt, she has been unwilling to fully \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nsatisfy or resolve her debts until after receiving the SOR in June 2018. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties. The following may \npotentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial obligations remain ongoing and unresolved. There is \ninsufficient evidence to demonstrate that similar delinquent debts are unlikely to recur. \nShe did not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant presented evidence to \nestablish partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). She was unemployed for seven months \nbetween 2014 and 2015, which contributed to some financial delinquencies and was a \ncircumstance beyond her control. In October 2015, she filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy as \na method to manage debts; however, after the bankruptcy was dismissed six months \nlater, there is no evidence that she took additional steps to responsibly resolve the \ndelinquent debts. Applicant did not provide evidence that she participated in credit or \nfinancial counseling and that her financial and tax delinquencies are sufficiently under \ncontrol, as required under AG \u00b6 20(c). \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nAfter receiving the SOR in June 2018, Applicant began addressing the outstanding \n2003 state tax and unpaid tollway debts from 2016 and 2017. She has not taken any \nsignificant steps to resolve the automobile repossession. There is insufficient evidence \ndocumenting good-faith efforts by her to resolve debts, as required to establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant successfully disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. AG \n\u00b6 20(e) applies to those debts. The evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(g) as to the alleged tax given the fact that her actions to resolve it through a payment \nplan is recent and she does not have a history of complying with it. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is an educated individual, who has consistently worked for federal \ncontractors since 2012, except for seven months when she was unemployed. She has \nearned a reasonable salary over those years, and currently earns over $100,000. Her HR \nrepresentative stated she was a valued employee. These are positive factors in this case. \nHowever, several facts remain concerning. Applicant has a history of being unable or \nunwilling to responsibly manage her financial obligations. She has failed to resolve a 2003 \nstate tax debt and a county debt owed for unpaid tolls from 2016 and 2017, both of which \nshe has known about for a couple years. She recently started paying an outstanding 2016 \nFederal tax debt. She did not seriously begin addressing the alleged debts until she \nreceived the SOR. At this time, she has not established a solid record of responsibly \nmanaging her finances, taxes, and delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nme with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.a \n \n: \n       For Applicant \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.b: \n \n \n        Against Applicant \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.c: \n \n  \n        For Applicant \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.d: \n \n                 For Applicant \n \n \n                Subparagraph 1.e: \n \n  \n        Against Applicant \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.f: \n \n                 For Applicant \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.g: \n \n  \n        Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 22, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) on January 25, 2019, scheduling \nthe hearing for February 11, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout The Russian Federation (Russia). The request was not admitted in evidence but \nwas appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) II. The facts administratively \nnoticed are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 was \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 26, 2019.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations but SOR \u00b6 1.e, which he denied. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. He is a 34-year-old, native-born U.S. \ncitizen. He is married and expecting his first child in late 2019. He has owned his \ncondominium in the United States since September 2015. (Tr. at 15, 21-22, 52; GE 1).  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2003. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2007. He has worked for various DOD contractors since approximately 2013. He \nworked as a managerial data analyst since July 2016. He was granted access to public \ntrust information in approximately 2008. He has never had a security clearance. (Tr. at \n5-6, 8-9, 14-17, 69-70; GE 1).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Russian-born citizen, residing with Applicant in the United \nStates (SOR \u00b6 1.a). She is 33 years old. They met at a restaurant in December 2013, \nwhere he was celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday and she was a customer. She arrived in \nthe United States on a student visa approximately three months earlier, to study English \nto advance her career as a travel agent in Russia. He testified that she had never \nworked for the Russian government or military. They married in March 2014 and \nApplicant has since sponsored her to obtain U.S. citizenship. (Tr. at 15-16, 23-26, 45-\n52, 59, 62; GE 1). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife worked as a Russian language teacher for an American \nlanguage education company for approximately two years. On occasion, she also \nworked at hotels. She attended several semesters of community college between \napproximately 2016 and 2018 to enhance her English skills, which have served as a \nbarrier for her employment. Though she speaks English fluently, she has \u201ca very strong \naccent.\u201d Applicant testified that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a regular job\u201d and last worked in \nOctober 2018, and he is the primary breadwinner. She is aware that Applicant is \nseeking a security clearance. He testified that he is confident that she has not told her \nfamily in Russia of such. (Tr. at 15-16, 23-26, 45-52, 59, 62; GE 1). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nRussia (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d). His mother-in-law is a 58-year-old retired state laborer. She \nreceives a pension from the Russian government of approximately $200 monthly. He \nand his wife give her approximately $500 yearly. She owns her apartment in Russia, the \nvalue of which Applicant testified was approximately $15,000 USD, and his wife stands \nto inherit it. Applicant and his wife visited her once yearly from 2016 to 2018 during the \nholidays, and they also Skype with her approximately once weekly. (Tr. at 15-17, 26-35, \n54-63, 69; GE 1). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother-in-law is 72 years old. Applicant testified that he and his \nwife Skype with her quarterly. They also see her when they visit Russia. Applicant\u2019s \ngrandfather-in-law is also a citizen and resident of Russia. He is elderly and \u201csleeps \npretty much the entire time.\u201d He performed mandatory service in the Russian military. \nBoth are retired state laborers. His grandmother-in-law receives a pension from the \nRussian government of approximately $300 monthly. Applicant testified that none of his \nwife\u2019s family in Russia are aware that he is seeking a security clearance, and are only \naware that he works with computers. (Tr. at 15-17, 26-35, 54-63, 69; GE 1). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a bank account in Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant testified \nthat his wife has had this interest-bearing account \u201clike a CD\u201d since 2016. She \ntransferred this money from a previous bank account she had in Russia after that bank \nfailed. His wife can access the money in her account a certain number of times \nthroughout the year, and she has done so to help her mother. Its balance is \napproximately $8,500 USD. He testified that it has been more convenient for his wife to \nleave this money in Russia and let it continue to accrue interest, but now that they are \nexpecting a child they will likely bring it over to the United States. (Tr. at 35-39, 63-64; \nGE 1). \n \n \nApplicant testified that neither he nor his wife have any other financial interests in \nRussia. Applicant purchased his condominium in the United States, in his name only, in \n2015 for $151,000. Its value as of the date of the hearing was $190,000. He has a total \nof approximately $123,000 in his 401k retirement account and individual bank account. \nHis wife has approximately $10,000 in her individual U.S. bank account. They also own \na car. (Tr. at 52-54; GE 1). \n \n \nWithin a year of getting married, Applicant took an intensive week and a half \nRussian language course at a Russian entity in Washington, D.C. He wanted \u201cto better \nbond with my wife\u201d and have conversations with his mother-in-law without the need for a \ntranslator. He then took 15 to 20 private lessons over the course of one year. His \nteacher and tutor was an individual whom he \u201cthought . . . was just a teacher\u201d at the \ntime and later became a Russian official. He testified that he did not learn the individual \nwas a Russian official until later. He also interacted with the Russian official at a party at \nthe Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., to which he and his wife were invited since \nhe was a student of the Russian entity. (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Tr. at 16, 21-22, 39-45, 64-68; GE \n1). \n \n \nApplicant testified that he and his wife attended poetry readings, musical recitals, \nand other cultural events at the Russian Embassy, through the Russian Orthodox \nChurch and a cultural entity, three to four times per year. He testified that at times, he \nand his wife attended such events together or separately, but one not more frequently \nthan the other. He testified that he last attended such an event at the Russian Embassy \nin early 2018 and his wife last did so that summer. He testified that he does not maintain \nregular contact with the above-mentioned Russian official, other than an occasional \nemail inviting him and his wife to such events. He testified that he was unaware whether \nthe individual was still a Russian official, but believed the individual still worked for the \nRussian entity. (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Tr. at 16, 21-22, 39-45, 64-68; GE 1). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he incidentally met a former Russian official at such a \ncultural event. He described their contact as a \u201chandshake\u201d and he did not have any \nprivate conversation with this individual. He testified that he did not learn until later that \nthis individual was expelled from the United States in 2018 for being an alleged Russian \nspy. He describes the contacts he has made through the Russian entity cultural events \nas \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201cclearly incidental, not sought out by me and aren\u2019t continuing.\u201d He \ntestified that none of these contacts are aware that he is seeking a security clearance, \nthough he knew that background investigators may have contacted the Russian official \nwho was his language teacher and tutor as he listed this individual as a foreign contact \non his security clearance application. (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Tr. at 16, 21-22, 39-45, 64-68; GE \n1). \n \n \nApplicant testified that neither he nor his wife and her family have been \napproached by any Russian authorities seeking information about what he does for a \nliving. He would report any such attempt to the FBI and his Facility Security Officer \n(FSO). He has undergone security training at work every six months for the past two \nyears and annual security training with previous employers since 2010. He testified that \nhe has received favorable performance evaluations by his employer. (Tr. at 58-63, 70-\n71). \n \nRussia \n \n \nIn 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) identified \nRussia as one of the three most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic \nespionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and proprietary information. The \nODNI assessed that Russia will: employ a variety of aggressive tactics to bolster its \nstanding as a great power, weaken the United States, and undermine Euro-Atlantic \nunity; use a range of relatively low-cost tools to advance its foreign policy objectives, \nincluding influence campaigns, economic coercion, cyber operations, and measured \nmilitary force; and continue to modernize, develop, and field a wide range of advanced \nnuclear, conventional, and asymmetric capabilities to balance its perception of a \nstrategic military inferiority vis-\u00e0-vis the United States. The ODNI also assessed that \npresident Vladimir Putin will likely increase his use of repression and intimidation to \ncontend with domestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a sluggish \neconomy and continue to manipulate the media and is likely to expand the Russian \ngovernment\u2019s legal basis for repression. \n \n \nThe ODNI has reported that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. \npresidential election represent the most recent expression of Russia\u2019s long-standing \ndesire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order. It noted that \u201cthese activities \ndemonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort \ncompared to previous operations. It assessed that Russian intelligence services will \ncontinue to develop its capabilities to provide Putin with options to use against the \nUnited States. \n \n \nThe 2018 U.S. Department of State (DOS) travel advisory for Russia advised \nU.S. citizens to reconsider travel due to terrorism and harassment. U.S. citizens are \n\n \n5 \n \noften victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion by law enforcement and other \nofficials. In 2017, the DOS reported that the most significant human rights abuses in \nRussia included extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture that was \nsystematic and sometimes resulted in death or included punitive psychiatric \nincarceration; harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention; lack of judicial independence; political prisoners; severe interference with \nprivacy; severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the media; increasingly \nsevere restriction on freedom of association, including laws on foreign agents and \nundesirable foreign organizations; and widespread corruption at all levels and in all \nbranches of government. The Russian government failed to take adequate steps to \nprosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses, resulting in a climate of \nimpunity. \n \n \nCybercrime is a significant problem in Russia. The risk of infection, compromise, \nand theft via malware, spam email, sophisticated spear phishing, and social engineering \nattacks are significant. Telephone and electronic communications are subject to \nsurveillance at any time without advisory. The Russian system for operational-\ninvestigative activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that traverses \nRussia\u2019s networks.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern for foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the individual \nto a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of \ninterest. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he does not maintain regular contact with any \nRussian officials. Though he and his wife last attended a cultural event at the Russian \nEmbassy in Washington, D.C. as recently as 2018, he credibly testified that any \ncontacts he made through the Russian entity cultural events are casual and not \ncontinuing. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) are not established for SOR \u00b6 1.e and I find \nSOR \u00b6 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nThough Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s U.S. citizenship paperwork is pending, she is still a \nRussian citizen. Her mother and grandmother are citizens and residents of Russia and \nthey receive monthly pensions from the Russian government. Applicant and his wife talk \nto her mother weekly and to her grandmother quarterly, and they visited them in Russia \nonce yearly from 2016 to 2018. They also provide her mother with approximately $500 \nyearly. Applicant\u2019s wife stands to inherit her mother\u2019s apartment in Russia, the value of \nwhich was approximately $15,000 as of the date of the hearing, and she continued to \nhave a bank account in Russia with approximately $8,500. Her assets in the United \nStates consist primarily of her individual bank account, for which her balance was \napproximately $10,000 as of the date of the hearing.  \n \n \nRussia is one of the three most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic \nespionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and proprietary information. \nRussian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most \nrecent expression of Russia\u2019s long-standing desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal \ndemocratic order, and Russian intelligence services will continue to develop its \n\n \n8 \n \ncapabilities to provide Putin with options to use against the United States. Telephone \nand electronic communications are subject to surveillance at any time and Russian \nauthorities are permitted to monitor and record all data that traverses Russia\u2019s \nnetworks. Applicant\u2019s in-laws and his wife\u2019s financial interests in Russia create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law are Russian citizens residing in \nRussia. His wife also has significant financial interests in Russia, as previously \ndiscussed. Accordingly, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(f) are not established for the reasons set \nout in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f). Applicant and his wife \nmaintain regular contact with her family in Russia. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen residing in the United States. He and his \nwife are expecting their first child in late 2019. He has substantial financial interests in \nthe United States. He has received favorable performance evaluations and has \nundergone required security training with his employer. These are all factors that weigh \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. However, his ties to his family in Russia through his wife are also \nstrong. As such, Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that he would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

DeAngelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns related to \nunpaid delinquent debts. Based on a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n03/19/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 23, 2018, and requested that her \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing \n(Answer). On October 17 and November 6, 2018, Department Counsel mailed Applicant \nthe Government\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining eight Items, was received by her on November 9, 2018. The FORM notified \nApplicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant timely \nsubmitted additional information, and did not object to the Government\u2019s Items. I marked \nthat information as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Items 1 through 8 and AE A are admitted \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 7, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied ten of the eleven allegations contained in the SOR and provided \nexplanations. She admitted the allegation in \u00b6 1.e. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old and married since 2012. She has a seven-year-old child. \nShe has earned some college credits. She has worked for federal contractors since 2006 \nand has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 4) \n \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). In February 2018, she was interviewed by a government investigator \nabout her background and financial delinquencies. The investigator inquired about 12 \nmedical debts that became collection accounts in 2015 and appeared on her July 2016 \ncredit bureau report (CBR). Applicant stated she did not recognize 10 of the accounts, \nbut would investigate them. She said she had two medical debts that she could not pay \nafter her son\u2019s birth in April 2012, because she did not have enough money. She said she \nsubsequently paid them. (Item 8) \n \n \nBased on the July 2016 CBR, the SOR alleged 11 delinquent medical debts that \ntotaled $19,367. They arose between August 2011 and December 2012, and became \ncollection accounts between September 2015 and November 2015. In her Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant stated that she was only responsible for one debt, \u00b6 1.e.1 She said she \nwas making payments on it and had lowered the balance. She did not submit proof of her \nassertion. She stated that she had no knowledge of the other 10 alleged debts. (Items 3, \n8) \n \n \nWith her Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided an August 2016 document from \na credit-reporting agency indicating that it deleted numerous debts after investigating the \ndisputes she filed regarding them. The following debts were disputed and deleted: \u00b6 1.c \nfor $3,528; \u00b6 1.g for $757; \u00b6 1.h for $625; and \u00b6 1.i for $584. Applicant did not provide \nevidence documenting the basis for her disputes or the deletions. (Item 3) \n                                            \n1 In her Answer, Applicant confused two SOR debts. She misstated the amount of the alleged debt in \u00b6 \n1.e as $2,936. The correct amount in \u00b6 1.e is $1,859. The amount of $2,936 is alleged in \u00b6 1.d, and is \nseemingly the debt she said she is paying. (Item 3) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nApplicant submitted a November 2016 credit report from another credit-reporting \nagency noting that the following debts were \u201cno longer on file\u201d and removed from her \ncredit report: \u00b6 1.a for $3,806; \u00b6 1.b for $3,717; \u00b6 1.d for $2,936; \u00b6 1.f for $811; and \u00b6 1.j \nfor $375. She did not provide any evidence documenting the basis for removal of the \ndebts from her credit report, such as they were wrongly reported, or the debts were paid. \nShe stated that she also needed to have the credit bureaus remove the debt alleged in \u00b6 \n1.k for $369, but gave no reason. (Item 3) \n  \n \nApplicant submitted a document confirming that she had participated in a credit \nrestoration program since August 2016. The program provides budget and credit \ncounseling services. (AE A) She did not provide a budget or other information related to \nher financial obligations from which to determine current financial reliability or compliance \nwith payment agreements.  \n \n \nApplicant provided performance evaluations for 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. All \nof the evaluations consistently rate her as \u201cmeeting expectations\u201d and \u201cexceeding \nexpectations\u201d in various categories. (AE A)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe record establishes the above disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry \nabout the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate financial security \nconcerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nWith support from substantial record evidence, the SOR alleges 11 medical \ndelinquent debts totaling $19,367, which arose over a period of two years. Applicant did \nnot produce evidence that the delinquent debts happened so long ago; that they occurred \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur; or that they occurred under circumstances \nthat were beyond her control and she acted responsibly under the circumstances. There \nis no evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or (b).  \n \nApplicant produced evidence that she has been enrolled in a program since August \n2016 that provides credit and budgetary services; however, she did not provide credible \nevidence that her delinquent debts are paid, resolved, or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies \nminimally. Applicant said she was making payments on one debt, but failed to submit \nproof of those payments. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant reported that 10 of the 11 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR have been \ndeleted or no longer appear on her credit report, implying that she is not responsible for \nthem. In order to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant must provide evidence \nthat she had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts or \notherwise took actions to resolve the issues. The fact that a creditor has charged off or \ndeleted a debt is not a valid basis to mitigate a debt under AG \u00b6 20(e). \u201cMere evidence \nthat debts no longer appear on credit reports is not reason to believe that they are not \nlegitimate or that they have been satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, \n2015)). Applicant failed to establish mitigation under this guideline for security concerns \narising from any of the debts.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old woman who has worked for defense contractors since \n2006, and held a security clearance since 2008. Her employer commends her work \nperformance. During 2011 and 2012, she accumulated 11 delinquent medical debts that \nwere sent to collection agencies in 2015, as reflected on a later credit report. In 2016, 10 \nof those debts were deleted from her credit report or no longer appear on it. As a result, \nshe asserts no responsibility for their resolution and provides no explanation for the \ncircumstances underlying them or basis for filing disputes. Those alleged debts totaled \nover $19,000 and remain relevant in evaluating her eligibility to hold a security clearance. \nApplicant said she was resolving a $2,900 debt, but did not provide documentation \nconfirming payments on it. Overall, she did not provide sufficient evidence of debt \nresolution.  \n   \nThe record evidence leaves me with doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k:    \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He has held a security clearance, at varying levels of access, since 1996. He completed his most recent security clearance application in August 2017, while being sponsored by another company. The ensuing background investigation revealed several delinquent debts. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $50,911 in delinquent accounts, including a $301,000 mortgage that was $7,000 in arrears at the time the SOR was issued.

Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 6, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for a determination whether to deny \nhis security clearance.  \n                                                          \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as \namended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, implemented on June 8, 2017.   \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing.

Concerned that he did not receive a copy of \nthe transcript as required pursuant to Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.24, I sent the parties an \nelectronic copy of the transcript to their respective email addresses of record on April 5, 2019. I also \nreopened the record to allow Applicant to submit the items as requested in the transcript. In his \nconformation of receipt of the transcript, Applicant indicated he attempted to submit his post hearing \nsubmission to Department Counsel and me on December 4, and again on December 28, 2018. Neither \nDepartment counsel nor I received the emails, which were likely blocked by the security features of the \nDOHA email system. On April 9, 2019, Applicant provided a copy of his December 28, 2018 post-hearing \nsubmission email and the attached documents.

He was unable to find comparable employment in City 2. He worked \ntemporary jobs as they became available and helped his wife with her business. He \nestimates their household income for 2017 at $65,000, consisting of $10,000 in income \nfrom the business and $55,000 withdrawn from their retirement accounts. They also \nrelied on credit cards to cover their living expenses. Their mortgage became delinquent \nand the mortgage holder initiated foreclosure proceedings. The nine credit cards alleged \nin the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.j), also became delinquent during 2017.6 \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant learned about a federal government facility in City 3, \nabout 90 miles from his home. He secured a position earning $87,000. As of the \nhearing, his wife\u2019s business generated approximately $30,000 in revenue for 2018. She \nalso returned to full-time employment in November 2018, earing $20 per hour. Since \nJanuary 2018, Applicant has paid the $7,000 past-due balance on his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and the $2,000 past-due amount on his car loan, which is not alleged in the SOR. \nBoth accounts are current. He has also resolved the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,071). \nIn February 2018, he established a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d \n($7,649) for $230 each month. He has paid $2,300 toward this debt. In October 2018, \nhe established a payment plan or the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,325) for $55.23 per \nmonth and has reduced this debt by $110. Applicant has also paid $300 toward the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($2,087). The debts alleged in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f,  \nremain unresolved. Applicant contacted the creditor holding SOR \u00b6 1.k ($110), but the \ncreditor did not have any record of the account.7  \n \nBefore 2017, Applicant enjoyed a favorable financial history. He does not have a \nhistory of delinquent debt or financial problems.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 23 \u2013 26, 29 \u2013 32. \n \n7 Tr. 27, 34 \u2013 44, 64; AE A \u2013 I.   \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.8 The SOR alleges that Applicant owed $50,911 in delinquent \ndebt. The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a \nbrief history of not paying his bills and that he had an inability to do so.9 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems  were not caused by events beyond his control, but \na series of personal choices that he and his wife made between 2014 and 2016. They \ndecided to move to another city, which required his wife to resign from federal \nemployment, reducing their household income by half. When the facility where Applicant \nworked closed in December 2016, he chose to resign from federal employment instead \nof maintaining his position with a long commute. He resigned without other employment \nand was underemployed for more than a year. However, since returning to full-time \n                                                          \n8 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n9 AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \n\n \n5 \n \nemployment in January 2018, Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay his \ndelinquent accounts.10 He has paid almost $12,000 toward his delinquent accounts. \nThis includes rehabilitating his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a car loan and making \npayments on the credit card accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.i. Applicant made a \ngood-faith, but unsuccessful effort to identify and resolve the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k. However, the $111 medical debt is not material to a determination of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness.  \n \nAlthough, four of the SOR debts, \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e. and 1.f, totaling $28,965 remain \nunresolved, this is not dispositive of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. The Appeal Board \nhas held that, \u201can applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for \npaying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. All that is required is that an \napplicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.11 Here, Applicant\u2019s actions thus far are enough to \nshow a track record of debt repayment.  \n \n \nBased on a consideration of the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability \nto properly handle and safeguard classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nhave also considered the whole-person factors detailed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is a \nlong-time clearance holder. He has a favorable financial history and his financial \nproblems are limited to a period of one year when he and his wife were underemployed. \nHe and has taken sufficient steps to rehabilitate his finances.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L.

He \nresolved the delinquent accounts alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR) and he is \nin control of his finances. He mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nClearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 6, 2016. \nHe was interviewed by a government investigator on January 10, 2018. After reviewing \nthe information gathered during the background investigation, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) issued an SOR on May 18, 2018, alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on June 7, 2018, \nand requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nFebruary 8, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on February 14, 2019. He was granted \na period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the FORM \n\n \n2 \n \n \nand to provide material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns. Applicant \nresponded to the FORM on March 7, 2019. He submitted a one-page statement with \neight pages of documents proving most of the student loans alleged against him were \nresolved, and raised no objections to the Government\u2019s proffered evidence. The case \nwas assigned to me on April 12, 2019. Absent any objections, I admitted and \nconsidered the Government\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s proposed evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the five SOR financial allegations (that he \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011, and had four charged-off student loans). (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e) He also submitted comments in mitigation and explanation. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982, and has \ncompleted some college courses. He has been married three times and divorced twice. \nHis most recent marriage was in 2005. He has four children ages 33, 31, 27, and 23, \nand a stepdaughter age 20.  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the Air Force and served on active duty between May 1983 \nand April 1987. He then served in the Reserve between March 1988 and May 1991. He \nreceived honorable discharges for both periods of service. He has held a security \nclearance since 1983. Applicant\u2019s sponsor, a federal contractor, hired him as a \nmechanic technician in June 2012. He has worked for his employer since June 2012.  \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2016 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011, which was discharged in 2012, \nand that he had delinquent student loans that he cosigned for his son. Applicant \nexplained to the government investigator during his 2018 interview that his financial \nproblems resulted from a period of unemployment between June 2011 and February \n2012, a failed personal business, his son\u2019s health problems that caused him to default \non his student loans and he was unable to repay them, a couple of judgments filed \nagainst him by his ex-wife and her mother, and his use of credit cards to pay for his \nliving expenses. He implied that all these factors came together at about the same time \nand he was advised by an attorney to file for bankruptcy.  \n \nApplicant noted that as a result of his employment with a federal contractor \nsupporting deployed U.S. forces in South-Central Asia, he has been deployed five times \nduring the last 10 years for extended periods of at least a year. His deployments to \nremote areas have made it more difficult for him to manage his finances and to resolve \nhis debts. \n \nApplicant highlighted that it has been more than seven years since he filed for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. He stated that his financial situation is currently good. He \nbelieves that he has learned a hard lesson as a result of his financial problems and no \n\n \n3 \n \n \nlonger uses credit cards to pay for his living expenses. He stated that he received \nfinancial counseling, is living within his financial means, and has acquired no new debt \nor additional delinquent accounts. He paid off his car, and has a steady job that allows \nhim to meet his financial obligations and living expenses. \n \nConcerning the student loans, Applicant explained that he did not address them \nsooner because he believed some of the loans had been forgiven by the creditors \nbecause of his son\u2019s medical condition, and that other loans has been paid off or were \nbeing paid by his son. He stated he was unsure of the status of the loans because he \nand his son had drifted apart and were not communicating. \n \nApplicant presented documentary evidence showing that the creditor of the \nstudent loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b cancelled the $21,828 debt in December 2018. (AE \n3) Applicant settled the student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $1,008, and paid it off in \nFebruary 21, 2019. (AE 3) The creditor of the student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d issued \nan IRS Form 1099-C (showing the debt was canceled, forgiven or discharged, and the \nperson must include the canceled amount in his/her gross income and pay taxes on that \nincome) to Applicant\u2019s son on December 31, 2018. (AE 3)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a charged-off student loan without an amount or account \nnumber. Applicant believed that three loans were discharged by the creditors and that \nhe settled the fourth loan. I note that during the 2018 interview, the investigator noted \ntwo other student loans that had been paid off and were not alleged in the SOR. I find \nSOR \u00b6 1.e resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He was \nunemployed for a significant period and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011. He also \ncosigned at least four student loans for his son that became delinquent and were \ncharged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are partially or fully \nraised by the facts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant developed \nfinancial problems, in part, because of his unemployment period, failed personal \nbusiness, and his son\u2019s medical problems. Thus, Applicant\u2019s financial problems could \nbe attributed to circumstances beyond his control. \n \n \nFollowing his bankruptcy discharge, Applicant maintained his financial \nresponsibility and has acquired no additional delinquencies. More importantly, he \npresented sufficient evidence to corroborate that some of the student loans were \ncancelled, discharged, settled, or paid off. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that \nthree of the loans alleged in the SOR were resolved. The investigator also discovered \ntwo other loans not alleged in the SOR that were paid off before the SOR was issued.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant could have been more diligent addressing his delinquent \nloans, I find that he has been financially responsible under his circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to demonstrate his current financial responsibility, and \nthat his financial problems are resolved. The financial considerations security concerns \nare mitigated.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 54, honorably served in the Air Force on active duty for about five \nyears and four years in the Reserve. He has held a clearance since 1983 without \nconcerns, expect for those in the SOR. He has been employed with a federal contractor \nsince 2012.

A naturalized U.S. citizen since 1992, Applicant mitigated the foreign \ninfluence concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the foreign influence guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether to deny his security clearance.  \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n03/19/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested his case be decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on November 5, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on  \nNovember 26, 2018. The Government submitted 15 Items, which were entered into the \nrecord without objection. Applicant responded to the FORM, which was marked as AE A \nand entered into the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 14, 2019. Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran. Without objection from Applicant, I approved the \nrequest. The relevant facts are highlighted in the Findings of Fact section, below.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 59, has worked as a linguist since January 2010 supporting the U.S. \nGovernment. He completed   security clearance applications in June 2017 and October \n2011, and during his counterintelligence (CI) screening in 2012, he disclosed his \nrelatives, and their connections to Turkey and Afghanistan. The SOR (1.a to 1.d) \nalleges that his brother and wife\u2019s family are citizens of Afghanistan and reside in Iran. \nApplicant, in his answer, denied that his relatives live in Iran. He explained that his \nbrother and one sister-in-law are refugees in Turkey; and that his mother-in-law and \nother sister-in-law are U.S. residents living in the United States. The earlier connection \nto Iran is described below.3 He was granted a security clearance in approximately 2009. \nHe was given a warning about financial issues in 2012. (Items 7, 8) \n \n  \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan and entered the United States in March 1986. \nHe was sponsored by his brother who was under special U.S. immigrant status due to \nwork for the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. Applicant reports no foreign military \nexperience. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1983 from a university in \nAfghanistan. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1992.  In 1993, he \nmarried a woman from Afghanistan who was born in Iran.4 His wife is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen and as a result of the marriage, Applicant has two children who are U.S. citizens. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are now deceased, but Applicant has two brothers who reside in the \nU.S. and at least one is a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Items 3, 4) \n                                                          \n2 The Government\u2019s administrative notice summary and attached documents are admitted to the record \nas Items 13, 14, and 15. \n  \n3 In the past Applicant and his wife travelled to Iran when her family was there. They \nattended her father\u2019s funeral who was a U.S. resident. Applicant has no intention of \nreturning to Iran. \n \n4 Her family lived in Iran, but fled to Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s wife has one brother in Iran who \nshe is sponsoring to come to the United States. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAs to SOR, 1.a, which alleges that Applicant\u2019s bother is a citizen of Afghanistan \nand resides in Iran, Applicant denied the statement. His answer and response to FORM \nstate that his brother is an Afghan citizen who resides in Turkey as a refugee. He lived \nin Iran for a period of time as reported by Applicant. (Item 4) He moved to Turkey so \nthat his children could receive an education in a country not at war. Applicant speaks to \nhis brother about three times per year. Applicant does not help his brother financially. \n(AE A) \n \n \n As to SOR 1.b, which alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of \nAfghanistan, Applicant admitted, but noted in his Response to FORM that his mother-in-\nlaw is a U.S. resident and lives in the United States with his family. She is a widow. She \nis not affiliated with the Afghan government and does not know the nature of Applicant\u2019s \nwork. His mother-in-law also has two sisters who live in the United States. (Item 11) \n \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.c, Applicant denied that his sister-in-law is a citizen and \nresident of Afghanistan. His wife\u2019s sister is a U.S. resident and lives with Applicant and \nhis family. She works and Applicant does not support her. She does not know the \nnature of Applicant\u2019s work. (AE A) \n \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.d, Applicant denied that his sister-in-law resides in Iran. \nShe is married to his brother is an Afghan citizen who is living in Turkey as a refugee. \nHe has limited contact with her and perhaps speaks on special holidays. She does not \nknow the nature of Applicant\u2019s work. (AE A) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is currently under a U.S. Department of \nState Travel Advisory due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict. Attacks \nhave targeted official Afghan and U.S. Government convoys and facilities, foreign \nembassies, military installations, commercial entities, non-governmental (NGO) offices, \nhospitals, residential compounds, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, airports, and \nschools. \n \n \nTerror attacks have continued into 2018, including an April 30, 2018, attack in \nKabul that killed 29 people and wounded dozens more, and a series of September 11, \n2018, attacks in Nangarhar Province that took the lives of many Afghans, including \nchildren. There are significant human rights issues including disappearances, torture, \narbitrary arrests, and violence against journalists. Afghanistan cooperates with the \nUnited States in a bilateral counterterrorism effort as part of Operation Freedom\u2019s \nSentinel (OFS), the U.S. operation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a member of the \nGlobal Coalition to Defeat ISIS. \n \n \nThe Republic of Turkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary \nsystem and a president. The U.S.-Turkey friendship dates to 1831. Turkey is an \nimportant U.S. security partner and has been a valued North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) ally since 1952. Turkey is a leader in the Alliance\u2019s Resolute \n\n \n4 \n \nSupport Mission in Afghanistan and is also a vital member of the Counter-ISIL Coalition.  \nTurkey continues to face a significant terrorist threat from both external and home-\ngrown sources. The current U.S. State Department travel warning for Turkey reflects an \nincreased risk from terrorist groups and the potential for violence against U.S. citizens \ndue to an increase in anti-American rhetoric. The U.S. State Department has also \nreported a number of significant human rights problems in Turkey, including inconsistent \naccess to due process following the July 15, 2016 coup attempt.5  \n \nThe U. S. Government states Iran is the most prominent State sponsor of \nterrorism in the world. The United States has no diplomatic or consular relations with \nIran, and the United States warns citizens not to travel to Iran, due to the high risk of \narbitrary arrests and imprisonment of U.S. citizens. \n  \n \nApplicant works as a linguist, embedded with a military unit. He serves as a \nliaison between his unit and the Afghan military. He also serves as a cultural guide \nwhen needed. Given the daily contact with his unit, Applicant has come to see the \nmilitary members he supports as his family. He considers it a vital part of his job to help \nkeep them all safe. Applicant and his family are proud citizens of the United States. He \nhas his immediate family in the United States. He has no financial interests in \nAfghanistan or Turkey. \n \n \nApplicant is held in high esteem by the U.S. military. The record contains six \ncertificates of appreciation and awards for his work since 2010. A letter of \nrecommendation touts Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability while working in a \nchallenging and ever-changing environment. The letter also discusses the invaluable \nnature of Applicant\u2019s translation skills and cultural knowledge, especially with locals in \nchallenging situations. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n5 Item 13 \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n  Foreign Influence \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interest may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d6 Although Turkey has \nhistorically been an ally of the United States, the recent political instability in the country \nand region has become a potential threat to U.S. interests operating there. Accordingly, \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his brother and sister-in-law who are refugees in Turkey  \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.7  \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s interactions with his family members in Turkey and \nAfghanistan may be infrequent, the relationships cannot be considered casual. \n                                                          \n6 AG \u00b6 6.  \n \n7 AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \n\n \n6 \n \nHowever, given the position and activities of Applicant\u2019s relatives in Turkey, it is unlikely \nthat Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the foreign \ninterests and those of the United States.8  The other relatives mentioned in the SOR are \nliving in the United States, but some are Afghan citizens and U.S. citizens. Furthermore, \nthese relationships do not present a conflict of interest because the ties that Applicant \nhas developed in his current position are so deeply intertwined with his own safety and \nself-interest, it is likely that Applicant will resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor \nof U.S. interests.9  \n \n \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect and \nhandle classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). For the past years, Applicant has been embedded \nwith a military unit. He has supported the U.S. mission at his own peril. He has \ndemonstrated that he takes his responsibilities very seriously, as echoed by the many \ncharacter letters he received in support of his application for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s work and conduct in his position as a linguist for the past nine \nyears is direct evidence of his ability to operate in a sensitive environment with direct \nnational security implications.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1 Foreign Influence: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d \n \n \n \nFor Applicant   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 30, 2012, and again on August 13, 2015, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nversions of a Security Clearance Application. On June 20, 2018, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n02/13/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and \nF (Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated July 17, 2018, supplemented by an e-mail message, \ndated August 12, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) on September 26, 2018, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on October 2, 2018. Applicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, \nfor as of November 29, 2018, he had not done so. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 25, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer and Supplemental Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without \ncomments, both of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.), and nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial \nconsiderations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. through 2.i.), although he disputed the amount \nset forth in SOR \u00b6 2.f. He failed to respond with an \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d to SOR \u00b6 2.a., so a \ndenial was registered for him. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. The record is silent \nas to the position that he now holds, and when he joined his new employer. A 1999 high \nschool graduate, Applicant received some college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army in July 1999, and served on active duty until August 2003, when he was \nadministratively discharged, and issued a General Discharge Under Honorable \nConditions. He stated that he was granted access to sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI) in 2000 and 2008, but did not identify the level of the clearances granted, and a \nsubsequent application for a security clearance was denied. Applicant has never been \nmarried, and he reports no children.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance was denied by \nanother government agency when it was determined that he had 20 delinquent accounts, \ntotaling more than $18,000 ; because he had misused corporate credit cards issued to \nhim by two former employers (in March 2005, when he charged $3,000; and in 2008-\n2009, when he charged $29,000); and because he had received a General Discharge \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nUnder Honorable Conditions from the U.S. Army, in part because he wrote checks with \ninsufficient funds.1  \n \n \nOn October 12, 2017, Applicant was terminated by his employer for willful misuse \nof company assets, by continuously charging non-business related expenses on his \ncompany credit card in violation of company policies. A review of his credit card usage \nrevealed over $7,500 in personal charges, including more than $4,000 in rental car \ntransactions; $1,200 on Uber transactions; $623 on cable television costs; and over $800 \nat a sports bar with billiards. In addition, Applicant allowed the account to become over \n130 days delinquent, resulting in the card being cancelled and the balance of over $7,500 \nbeing charged to the company.2 \n \nFinancial Considerations3 \nIt is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, and he did not \nidentify any factors that contributed to them. The record does refer to three periods of \nunemployment: August 2003 until September 2003; September 2006, for less than a \nmonth when he was fired because he repeatedly failed to come to work on time; and \nNovember 2006 until May 2007. Because of his financial difficulties Applicant apparently \nhad insufficient funds to cover all of his monthly bills, and corporate credit cards were \nsometimes used by him. Accounts became delinquent, some accounts were charged off, \njudgments were filed against him, and one vehicle was repossessed. Some of those \ndelinquent debts were not alleged in the SOR.4 Applicant never received financial \ncounseling. \nIn addition to the three company credit-card accounts described above, the SOR \nidentified eight delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off as \n                                                          \n1 Item 3 (e-QIP, dated March 30, 2012), at 41-42; Item 4 (e-QIP, dated August 13, 2015), at 44-46; \nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated July 17, 2018), at 1; Item 5 (Personal Subject Interview, dated \nJune 6, 2012), at 1, 7. \n \n2 Item 8 (Employment Records \u2013 Termination of Employment, dated October 12, 2017). \n \n3 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 9 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August \n20, 2015); Item 10 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 12, 2018); Item 8, supra note 2; Item 5, supra note \n1); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 20, 2017); Item 6 (Subject Contact, dated August 10, \n2017); Item 3, supra note 1; Item 4, supra note 1; and Item 2, supra note 1. \n \n4 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

There is no evidence of a \nbudget. Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation is now under \ncontrol.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d5 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d6   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n                                                          \n5 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n6 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d7 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.8  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d9  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d10 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n7 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. \nBd.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes some conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16:  \n \n(d) Credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information; . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of [the] employer\u2019s time or \nresources;  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . .; and   \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s poor military performance and rule violations resulted in his being \ndischarged and issued a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions. He misused \ncorporate credit cards issued to him by several employers, in one instance improperly \ncharging over $7,500 in personal charges, including more than $4,000 in rental car \ntransactions; $1,200 on Uber transactions; $623 on cable television costs; and over $800 \nat a sports bar with billiards. His conduct over a number of years established a clear \npattern of dishonesty and rule violations, as well a significant misuse of his employers\u2019 \nresources. He was fired from employment as recently as October 2017 for willful his \nmisuse of company assets in violation of company policies. In addition, Another \nGovernment Agency denied his eligibility for a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) \nhave been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s pattern of behavior, whether it \nrefers to routinely ignoring military rules and regulations or to violating corporate policies, \nis a common theme that is frequent and generally recurs, regardless of his employment \nenvironment. Recognizing that Applicant was previously denied a security clearance, he \noffered no evidence to indicate that he has taken positive steps to alleviate the factors \nthat contributed to his unreliable and inappropriate behavior since that denial action. \nApplicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nIn addition to the three company credit-card accounts that Applicant misused over \nseveral years, the SOR identified eight delinquent accounts that had been placed for \ncollection or charged off, totaling approximately $27,364. Those accounts remain \nunaddressed and delinquent. Because of the absence of information regarding \nApplicant\u2019s finances over the past few years, it is difficult to determine if he was unwilling, \nbut able, to address his debts, or simply unable to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) \nhave been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;11 \n                                                          \n11 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;12 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant failed to explain why or how he got into debt. He did not \nspecifically attribute his financial difficulties to any identified factors. He offered no \nstatements or documentation to reflect that he had made any efforts, before or after he \nwas interviewed by OPM, or before or after the SOR was issued in June 2018, to: obtain \nfinancial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service; dispute his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies or \nthe creditors themselves; contact his creditors to set up repayment plans; or indicate that \npayments had been made to his creditors.13 An applicant who begins to resolve his \n                                                          \n \n12 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n13 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is \nin jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.14  \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, to date, there is no evidence \nthat any corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.15 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.16   \n                                                          \n14 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n15 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n16 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 37-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. He is a 1999 high school graduate, and he received \nsome college credits, but no degree.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. He was administratively discharged by the U.S. Army, and issued a General \nDischarge Under Honorable Conditions, due in part to writing checks with insufficient \nfunds; he misused company credit cards with different employers, and he was either \ndisciplined or terminated; and he was previously denied a security clearance. Although \nnot alleged in the SOR, he also had alcohol-related issues and used marijuana. It is now \nmid-February 2019, and Applicant has not shown any voluntary effort to address his \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is unknown. Considering the lack \nof evidence regarding his current finances, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion \npertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:17 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, failing to take any corrective actions with respect to his delinquent \ndebts. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

White, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n05/30/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case,1 I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance. \nOn 31 October 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. 2 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 7 \nMarch 2019 and I convened a hearing 9 April 2019. DOHA received the transcript 19 \nApril  2019, and the record closed. \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A. AE A was timely received post hearing. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on 8 June \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 54-year-old senior configuration \n3 \nmanager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2017. He served in the\nU.S. military for four years in the late 1980's\u2014during which time he held a \nclearance\u2014and was honorably discharged. He claims to have held an industrial \nclearance since 2005 (GE 1). \nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits four \ndelinquent debts totaling over $131,000. The debts comprise $128,110 of a charged-off \nhome equity line of credit and two charged-off credit cards (SOR 1.a-1.c)4 held by the \nsame creditor, and $2,627 of a charged-off store credit card (SOR 1.d). \nAlthough Applicant did not report any financial problems on his January 2017 \nclearance application (GE 1), he volunteered his financial problems\u2014including the SOR \ndebts\u2014during a February 2018 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), based \non his June 2017 credit report (GE 3). He told the investigator that he thought he had \nreceived a Form 1099-C covering SOR debt 1.a. \nAE A shows that the SOR 1.a creditor issued Applicant an Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) for the SOR amount for tax year \n2016; issued Applicant a Form 1099-C for the SOR 1.b amount for tax year 2017; and \nissued Applicant a Form 1099-C for the SOR 1.c amount for tax year 2018. The SOR \n1.d creditor did not issue Applicant a Form 1099-C. The Form 1099-Cs do not state \nwhen the forms were issued, only the tax year covered. \nApplicant claims, without corroboration, that he tried to work out a payment plan \nwith the creditor for SOR debts 1.a-1.c, but was unsuccessful because once the \naccounts were charged off, the creditor insisted on a full, lump sum, payment. He \nclaims, also without corroboration, to have reported the debt cancellations as income in \nthe noted years, as required. However, applicant did not submit copies of his income tax \nreturns to corroborate that claim; 5 the 2016 tax transcript Applicant submitted did not \nreport a gross income figure, and the adjusted gross income figure the transcript reports \nis less than the $100,000 amount of forgiven debt. Moreover, Applicant discovered that \n3Previously, he worked for a different vendor in support of the same user agency from October 2016 to March \n2017, and with yet another vendor for the same user agency from April-September 2016. He had previously \nbeen employed with yet a third vendor for the same user agency from May 2005 to July 2013, when he was \nlaid off. \n4The line of credit and two credit cards are Applicant\u2019s individual debts; the store credit card is a joint account \nwith his wife (GE 3). \n5Moreover, Applicant\u2019s September 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2) included a July 2018 IRS \ntax account transcript for tax year 2016 that records an adjusted gross income that is too low to include the \namount of debt forgiven. Applicant did not submit tax account transcripts for 2017 or 2018, so there is no \nevidence to show whether Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income for those years reflects the amounts of forgiven \ndebt. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe cancellation of debt applies only to his tax calculations; it does not relieve him of his \nlegal obligation to pay. Yet, while the creditor has apparently not taken any action to \nrecover the debts, Applicant appears to have undertaken no efforts to have the creditor \nformally commit to not pursue the debts further. Applicant has taken no action to \naddress the delinquent store credit card. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his unemployment and \nunderemployment between about July 2013 and May 2014. While this may explain the \ndelinquencies of SOR debts 1.a-1.c, each of which was last acted upon February-March \n2014, this does not explain the delinquent store credit card, which was last acted upon \nin December 2011 (GE 3). \nIn addition to not providing any evidence of efforts to deal with the specific debts, \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling. He submitted no budget. He \nsubmitted no work or character references, or any evidence of civic or community \ninvolvement. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n6 See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant had three charged-off debts \nfrom the same creditor reduced to Form 1099-Cs. Applicant did not corroborate his \nclaim that he included these debts as income in the required year. He provided no \nevidence of efforts to resolve the debts, either before or after the forms were issued. He \ndocumented no investigation of SOR debt 1.d.7 \nThe mitigating conditions for financial considerations provide insufficient help to \nApplicant. The conduct was recent, frequent, although the circumstances might now be \nconsidered to be unlikely to recur. 8 The circumstances of his financial problems were \ncertainly largely beyond his control for SOR debts 1.a-1.c, but are unexplained for SOR \ndebt 1.d. However, he has not documented that he attempted any responsible \nresolution of his debts.9 \nApplicant has not documented credit and financial counseling, and submitted no \nbudget. There is no evidence that his financial problems have been resolved or are \nunder control.10 This failure of evidence precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made \na good-faith effort to address his debts because he cannot show substantial evidence \nthat he is adhering to his effort. 11 Moreover, he provided no work or character \nreferences, or any evidence of civic or community involvement to support a whole-\nperson assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his current financial \nsituation. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs a-d: \nAgainst Applicant \n7\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history \nof not meeting financial obligations; \n8\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n9\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n10\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n11\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n                                             \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.

She further emphasized long-standing DOHA case law that it is necessary for \n                                                          \n1 The limited background information regarding Applicant was derived from the FORM and was the most \ncurrent information available. \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \napplicants to provide mitigating documentation. As noted, Applicant did not submit any \nadditional information within the 30-day period following receipt of his FORM. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Based on the information in the SOR, the record \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nIn summary, no mitigating conditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the \nfacts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of his adult life, and he is \npresumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information \nsuggesting his long-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts remain \nabout his suitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications. According, those doubts must be \nresolved against Applicant. \n \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. He failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nregarding his past efforts to address his delinquent debt. By failing to provide such \ninformation, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to fully establish \nmitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

He had several alcohol incidents, while holding a security clearance, and \nfailed to notify his security officer. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 15, 2016. On \nAugust 24, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption and \nGuideline E, personal conduct. Applicant answered the SOR on September 8, 2018, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The Government was \nready to proceed on October 19, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on December \n4, 2018. On December 13, 2018, I issued an order to both parties to produce their \nevidence by December 26, 2018, and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for January 10, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted, without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C were admitted, without \nobjection. I received the completed transcript (Tr.) on January 23, 2019. I held the \nrecord open until January 17, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. He timely submitted AE D, which I admit without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old senior consultant who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since August 2012. He requires a security clearance for this \nemployment. He was previously granted an interim secret clearance in 2012, which was \napproved in 2014. Applicant is single and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2009. (Tr. 9-10, 16-17) \n \nIn February 2012, Applicant went to New Orleans for a vacation during Mardi \nGras. Over the course of the day, he consumed several alcoholic drinks with his friends. \nApplicant continued to drink that night, he became intoxicated, but could not find a \npublic restroom. While Applicant was urinating outdoors in a public area, a police officer \napproached him, and gave him a citation for lewd conduct. Applicant hired a local \nattorney to represent him in absentia at his court hearing, and the citation was \ndismissed. (GE 1 at 41; GE 2 at 13; GE 5 at 5; Tr. 17-20, 42-43) \n \nApplicant disclosed the 2012 incident in his 2012 and 2016 SCAs, because he \nwas advised to \u201cinclude anything and everything.\u201d The incident above occurred shortly \nbefore he completed his first SCA; however, Applicant did not disclose the incident to \nhis facility security officer (FSO) or program manager.1 (GE 1 at 41; GE 2 at 13; Tr. 42-\n43) \n \nIn March 2013, Applicant had plans to attend a National Hockey League (NHL) \ngame after work with a coworker, during the middle of the week. That morning when he \nwent to work, he left his vehicle outside of a public transportation center in anticipation \nof his evening plans. Applicant consumed three beers at the game, he went to at least \none bar after the game, and consumed two liquor drinks. (GE 1 at 42; GE 2 at 3, 13-14; \nTr. 20-23, 44-45) \n \nAt the end of the night, Applicant took public transportation to his car and drove \nfor approximately five to seven minutes. While he was driving, he felt intoxicated, and \ndecided to pull his vehicle over to the side of the road and sleep. He slept for \napproximately an hour, when a police officer knocked on the window of Applicant\u2019s car \nand woke him up. Applicant was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and the keys were in the \nignition. Applicant failed the field sobriety tests. He was given a breathalyzer, and his \nblood alcohol content (BAC) was .13%. He was arrested and charged with \ndriving/attempting to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). \nApplicant\u2019s license was suspended for a period prior to the court hearing. The arresting \n                                                          \n1 During his October 2017 government interview, Applicant told the investigator that he had not told his \nparents or coworkers about the 2012 lewd conduct citation. (GE 2 at 13) \n\n \n3 \n \nofficer did not appear at Applicant\u2019s court hearing, and the charges were dismissed.2 \n(GE 2 at 3, 13-14; GE 3; Tr. 20-23, 44-46) \n \nApplicant testified that after the 2013 arrest, he did not seek counseling or \ntreatment, but he changed his behavior for a period of time. He used ride shares and \nstopped drinking for a few months before his court hearing. After the charges were \ndismissed, he resumed the consumption of alcohol. (GE 2 at 14; Tr. 23-24)  \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant went out for dinner on a work night with a friend and \nconsumed a couple of drinks. After dinner they went to the friend\u2019s parents\u2019 house and \nhe had approximately two more drinks. He testified that did not intend to drink alcohol, \nbut consumed approximately four drinks in four to five hours, and he thought he was \nsober enough to drive. He left the house, drove five minutes, and then pulled over to \nrest. After sleeping for approximately 45 minutes, a police officer approached his vehicle \nand woke him. Applicant was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with the keys in the ignition. \nApplicant failed the field sobriety tests, and his BAC results were .14%. He was arrested \nand charged with (DUI). The arresting officer did not come to his court hearing, and the \ncharges were dismissed in December 2017. (GE 2 at 3, 14-15, 17; GE 4; Tr. 24-29, 48) \n \nApplicant did not seek treatment or counseling after his third alcohol-related \narrest. He testified that he was relieved that the charges were dropped, he reflected on \nthe incident, stopped drinking for a few weeks, but did not believe that alcohol classes \nwould have been \u201cbeneficial.\u201d Applicant resumed drinking after the 2017 DUI charges \nwere dismissed in late 2017. (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 28-31, 33-34, 47, 49)  \n \nIn his September 2018 Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated he intended to \nseek an alcohol evaluation, and he was abstaining from the consumption of alcohol. On \nJanuary 1, 2019, he paid for an alcohol and drug evaluation from a private facility. The \nassessment found that Applicant does not need treatment. (Answer; AE A; AE D) \n \nApplicant testified that he continued to drink after the SOR was issued, and he \nlast consumed alcohol a few weeks before the hearing. After each of the incidents \nalleged in the SOR, Applicant told government investigators that he intended to modify \nhis consumption of alcohol. (Answer; GE 5 at 5; GE 2; AE A; AE C; AE D; Tr. 15, 32-33, \n35-37) \n \nApplicant\u2019s two DUI arrests occurred on work nights. He testified that on both \noccasions, he drove, in part, because it was a work night, and he wanted to get home to \nbe responsible, sleep, and then go to work the next day. Following both arrests, \nApplicant was taken into custody, and his vehicle was towed. He was released early in \nthe morning on both occasions and called into work as sick, and did not disclose the \narrests to his FSO. In his notes that he prepared for the hearing, Applicant stated that \nhe \u201cwasn\u2019t really driving\u201d before the 2013 and 2017 arrests. (AE C at 1; Tr. 21, 25; 62-\n63) \n                                                          \n2 During his October 2017 government interview, Applicant told the investigator that he had not told his \nparents or coworkers about the 2013 arrest. (GE 2 at 14) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThroughout his six and half years of employment for his company, Applicant has \nattended yearly security clearance training. He was aware that he had a duty to report \nderogatory or adverse information to his employer. Applicant testified that he was \nunsure if he was required to report information prior to a final determination and if he \nwas required to report the two DUI arrests despite the dismissal of the charges. There is \nno evidence that Applicant sought clarification on this issue. (AE C; Tr. 37-39)  \n \nApplicant did not report either of the DUI arrests to his FSO when the arrests \noccurred. He testified that the arrests were embarrassing, and he was worried about his \njob. Applicant did disclose the 2013 and 2017 arrests to the government investigator \nduring his interview in October 2017. (GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 39-41, 46-47, 50-56)  \n \nApplicant presented a reference letter from his program manager. She found him \nto be reliable and effective in his role at the company. (AE B; Tr. 15)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n\n \n6 \n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents between February 2012 and August \n2017. The last two incidents were arrests for DUI, and they occurred while he held a \nsecurity clearance.  All three of the arrests were dismissed, as a result Applicant did not \nface any legal consequences for his behavior. His multiple claims over the years that he \nchanged his behavior and consumption of alcohol are unconvincing, due to the \nfrequency and number of arrests. The passage of time since the 2017 alcohol incident \nis insufficient to mitigate the underlying concerns.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s argument that he was not really driving before the 2013 and 2017 \narrests, demonstrate that he has not acknowledged the magnitude of his bad choices. \nHis brief periods of abstinence in preparation for his court cases do not mitigate his \nbehavior as well. Finally, due to the recency of Applicant\u2019s 2017 arrest, he has not yet \nestablished a pattern of responsible use of alcohol.  \n \n \nPrior to Applicant\u2019s hearing, he sought an alcohol assessment, which determined \nthat no treatment was recommended. He did not seek counseling or treatment after \neither of the DUI arrests. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \n\n \n7 \n \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \n \nIn this case, Applicant claimed he was unaware that he had a duty to report his \narrests to his FSO when they occurred, regardless of the final determination. Given \nApplicant\u2019s educational and professional background and his expressed concern about \nhis employment due to the arrests, Applicant deliberately did not disclose his multiple \nalcohol-related incidents to his FSO. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \nmitigating. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose derogatory information regarding his alcohol-related \nincidents to his FSO. Applicant admitted that he was embarrassed by his behavior and \nconcerned about his employment. Although, he disclosed his arrest to the government \ninvestigator, his failure to be forthright to his employer is concerning. There is no \nevidence that the government was aware of the 2013 arrest before Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance was granted in 2014.  \n \nApplicant made deliberate choices to keep his employer in the dark regarding his \nbehavior, raising the concern that he is unreliable and untrustworthy and calling into \nquestion his judgment and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. This \n\n \n8 \n \nconcern has not been mitigated by the passage of time. Neither of the mitigating \nconditions apply in this case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \n \n \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant used marijuana between June 2002 and August 2017, including after he \nhad been granted a Department of Defense (DOD) security clearance in May 2009 and \nafter he had denied any intention of using marijuana in the future. A longer period of \nabstention is required to conclude that his marijuana use is safely in the past. Clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, which explained why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, to all \nadjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n11/28/2018\n\n2 \n \nOn June 15, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On August 1, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for September \n17, 2018. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and ten \nApplicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were admitted into evidence without objection. A July 18, 2018 \nletter forwarding discovery of the then proposed GEs to Applicant was incorporated in the \nrecord as a hearing exhibit (HE I), but not admitted as evidence. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on September 27, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is alleged under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and cross-alleged under \nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) to have used marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately June 2002 to August 2017, to include a period while holding a DOD security \nclearance granted to him on May 13, 2009. Applicant is also alleged under Guideline H \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) to have failed to commit to discontinue his use of marijuana despite stating on \nApril 29, 2009, and on January 24, 2017, that he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. After considering his response to the SOR (AE I), other exhibits, and the hearing \ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old principle systems engineer. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in \naeronautical engineering awarded in May 2009. He has been married since February 2016, \nand purchased his current residence in approximately March 2014. Applicant holds a DOD \nsecret security clearance, which was granted to him in May 2009 for his duties with a \nprevious defense-contractor employer (company X). He has worked for his current \ndefense-contractor employer since August 2016. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant began using marijuana as a sophomore in high school because of peer \npressure in approximately June 2002. He continued to use marijuana with varying \nfrequency, on average three times a month in high school and then in college from August \n2005 to January 2009. His use peaked between August 2006 and May 2008 during his \nsophomore and junior years of college. (GE 1.) During the summer of 2008, Applicant had \nan internship with company X. During his last semester of college, he was offered \npermanent employment with the defense contractor. On March 24, 2009, Applicant \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) for that employment. In response to an inquiry concerning any illegal use of a \ncontrolled substance in the last seven years, Applicant disclosed that he had used \nmarijuana several times a month between June 2002 and January 2009. He estimated that \nhe used marijuana 234 times total during that period and indicated that he ceased his use \nof marijuana when he began his search for post-college employment. Applicant also \ndisclosed that he had used approximately two grams of a hallucinogen before a concert in \n\n3 \n \nJuly 2007 and that he had tried cocaine twice over the course of one weekend in January \n2004. (GE 3.) \n \nOn April 21, 2009, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about his drug use. He explained that his \nmarijuana use peaked in college because he wanted to impress upper classmen. He \nindicated that he smoked marijuana from a glass pipe passed around with three former \nfriends from his fraternity, who had since graduated and moved away. He named the three \nfriends.1 Applicant indicated that he purchased marijuana on occasion and sold marijuana \nto friends in his fraternity if he had some available. His drug involvement did not adversely \naffect his academic studies, as he maintained a grade point average of 3.4 or higher. \nApplicant stated that he did not use marijuana during his final examinations or during his \nsummer internship with company X. He had passed a drug screen for that internship. \nApplicant denied any future intention of using marijuana because he did not want \nmarijuana to interfere with his career ambitions. As for his use of a hallucinogen in July \n2007, Applicant obtained hallucinogenic mushrooms from a friend prior to a concert. He \nexperienced effects of nausea, disorientation, and edginess. About his disclosed cocaine \nuse, Applicant explained that he tried cocaine two times with friends on December 31, \n2003, when the drug was offered to him. He disliked the effects of both the hallucinogen \nand cocaine and expressed no intention to use either drug in the future. (GE 1.) Applicant \nwas granted a DOD secret clearance in May 2009. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant graduated from college in May 2009, and he started working for company \nX in July 2009. In December 2009, he resumed using marijuana on an infrequent basis, \napproximately three to four times a year, at social gatherings with two close fraternity \nbrothers from college (friends #1 and #2). (GE 2.) He described his lifestyle as \u201cwork-\ncentric.\u201d He had relocated to a new state for work where he did not know anyone, but when \nhe had the opportunity to return home or see friends, \u201cthese get-togethers had a \ncelebratory, cut loose type of nature.\u201d (Tr. 42.) Applicant moved to his current area in \nMarch 2014 and worked remotely for company X through July 2016, when he left the job \nfor his current employment. (GE 2.) Applicant used marijuana in March 2016 with friend #2, \nwho then resided in a distant state and had flown in to serve as his best man. Applicant \nbelieved it would be some time before he would see friend #2 again, and it felt like a \nspecial occasion. (Tr. 43.) \n \n On January 24, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a SF 86 \nto renew his security clearance eligibility. In response to an inquiry concerning any illegal \nuse of drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, Applicant disclosed that he \nhad used marijuana recreationally during social gatherings, approximately three to four \ntimes per year from December 2009 to March 2016. He admitted that he had used \nmarijuana while possessing a security clearance. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he \nintended to use the drug in the future and stated: \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant discrepantly testified that two other friends (friends #1 and #2) were the persons with whom he \nprimarily used marijuana in college. (Tr. 73.) \n\n4 \n \nMy use of marijuana during the past 7 years was an extension of habits \ndeveloped during college, and occurred with college acquaintances. I \nconsider it a \u201cphase\u201d from which I have grown out of. My last use was almost \n1 year ago, and I have no intentions of revisiting this behavior. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAfter abstaining from marijuana since March 2016, Applicant used the drug with \nfriends #1 and #2 in August 2017. Applicant, his wife, and friend #1 traveled to see friend \n#2, who lived at that time in a state in the path of a solar eclipse. Applicant and friends #1 \nand #2 were in a mood to celebrate, which apparently \u201cled to a momentary dropping of \n[Applicant\u2019s] guard.\u201d (Tr. 43-44.) Applicant spent about $40 for the marijuana that he used. \n(GE 1; Tr. 74.) \n \n \nOn February 28, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. About his \nmarijuana use three to four times yearly from December 2009 to March 2016, he admitted \nthat he used the drug with friends #1 and #2 while possessing a security clearance and \nknowing that his employer at the time (company X) had policies prohibiting illegal drug use. \nHe was aware that if he had been caught, he would have been subject to possible \ndisciplinary action. He indicated that his friends provided him the drug, and that he typically \nused three or four joints at a time on the weekends with them. While he did not always use \nmarijuana when associating with them, marijuana use was a common activity with them. \nApplicant volunteered that he used marijuana after March 2016 on one occasion. In August \n2017, he and friends #1 and #2 shared two or three grams of marijuana, which he \nindicated was purchased legally by his friends, but then transported across state lines and \nused illegally.2 Applicant acknowledged the conflict between using an illegal drug and \nholding a security clearance. He expressed some concern should his current employer find \nout about his use of marijuana, but he indicated that he would inform his employer about \nhis drug use if someone threatened blackmail. When asked about his future intentions, \nApplicant responded that he could not say that he would not use marijuana again because \nsmoking the drug with these two friends is something they do together and have done so \nfor a decade. (GE 1.)  \n \n \nOn March 2, 2018, Applicant was re-contacted by the investigator about why he had \nindicated on his SF 86 that he had no intention to use marijuana again, given he had used \nmarijuana approximately seven months later and was unable to commit to no future use as \nof his February 2018 interview. Applicant explained that he had no plan to use marijuana \nagain as of his January 2017 SF 86 and that marijuana was not an active part of his \nlifestyle. He acknowledged that he might use marijuana in the future, but he had no \nconcrete plan to use marijuana again. (GE 1.) At his hearing, he clarified that he did not \n                                                 \n2 Applicant admitted at his hearing that he purchased some marijuana on that occasion as well and \ntransported it across state lines for use in a state where marijuana is illegal. As to why he would take the risk, \nApplicant indicated that he was curious about the experience of legally purchasing marijuana. He \nacknowledged knowing that it was a crime to bring a controlled substance across state lines, but added: \n \nI can\u2019t defend the action. I can only state at the time it did not trip a mental threshold for me. \nAnd I attribute that in part to the quantity that we had. Again, it was very minimal in nature. I \nguess I would describe it as a minor offense that I did not necessarily\u2014that did not \nnecessarily influence me against participating in the experience. (Tr. 74-76.) \n\n5 \n \nmean to suggest that he would use marijuana. Rather, he \u201cconservatively postulate[d] that \na hypothetical scenario could exist.\u201d (Tr. 70.) \n \n \nApplicant listed his college friends #1 and #2 as references on his January 2017 SF \n86. (GE 1.) An OPM investigator interviewed Applicant\u2019s college friend #2 on March 22, \n2018, as part of Applicant\u2019s background investigation. Friend #2 indicated that he and \nApplicant engaged in recreational use of marijuana together in college from 2006 to 2009. \nAfter graduation, they had in-person contact annually and smoked a joint together on those \noccasions. Friend #2 indicated that Applicant was aware that using marijuana had \nramifications for his job and security clearance, but that Applicant was not going to use \nmarijuana in the future. Friend #2 added that they were both growing older and the desire \nto smoke marijuana did not exist. (AE J.) Applicant recalls telling his friends in September \n2017 that he did not intend to use any marijuana in the future. (Tr. 79.) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant executed a statement on June 14, 2018, \naffirming his commitment to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse in the \nfuture with an acknowledgement that any future drug involvement or misuse would be \ngrounds for immediate revocation of his security clearance eligibility. Citing his candor \nabout his illegal drug involvement, he indicated that he has \u201ccome to better appreciate the \nperceptions and expectations of others as [he has] matured.\u201d He added that his interest in \nmarijuana and the frequency of his use has diminished over time, and he expressed \nconfidence in his ability to refrain from any future illegal drug use. Concerning his previous \nreluctance to commit to discontinuing future drug use, Applicant explained that it \u201cwas \ngrounded in [his] desire to be truthful and open about a hypothetical future that could put \n[him] in a position where [he] may be perceived as dishonest.\u201d He added that he had no \nreservations about his ability to abstain from using marijuana. (AE I.)  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant reiterated that he had no intention of using marijuana in the \nfuture and that he was confident in his ability to adhere to this commitment. (Tr. 33.) He \nacknowledged that he had \u201cnot expertly executed prior commitments\u201d to abstain from \nmarijuana, but that his signed statement agreeing to revocation of his security clearance for \nany future drug use is something that he takes very seriously. (Tr. 69.) He expressed a \nwillingness to submit to random drug screening. (Tr. 35.) Regarding actions taken to \nchange or avoid environments conducive to drug use, Applicant asserted that his use since \ncollege \u201chas been restricted to close friends and family members whom [he] trust[s] \nexplicitly.\u201d (Tr. 40.) He testified that it would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for him to fully \ndisassociate himself from friends #1 and #2, but they no longer use marijuana together. \n(Tr. 51-53.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse does not use marijuana. Applicant has known of her disapproval \nof his marijuana use, which he submits has been another motivating factor in his decision \nto stop using the drug. (Tr. 78.) \n \n \nApplicant is active in some community activities. He served as a robot design judge \nin his state\u2019s high school championship held in December 2017. (AE D.) In July 2018, he \n\n6 \n \nwas selected for and participated in a 5K race to benefit a charitable cause that benefits \nveterans, military service members, and their families. (AE E; Tr. 60.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s close fraternity friends #1 and #2 from college provided character \nreferences for him. Friend #1 owns a small electric contracting and consulting business. \nThey lived together in college from spring 2007 to spring 2009 and remained close after \ncollege. They have telephone contact once a month and take backpacking trips or other \noutings together at least twice a year. Friend #1 holds Applicant in high esteem and \n\u201cconsiders his words to have great value.\u201d Applicant can be counted on to provide well \nthought-out advice. In his experience, Applicant is a person who does what he says he will \ndo. Applicant informed friend #1 that it is inappropriate for him to continue to use \nmarijuana, and friend #1 indicates that he is fully supportive of him in that regard. He \nbelieves Applicant is an asset to national security, dedicated to his work, and \u201ca man of \nhonor and trustworthiness.\u201d (AE H.) \n \n \nFriend #2 has known Applicant since the fall of 2006 in college and considers him to \nbe one of his closest and most trusted friends. They have kept in regular contact since \ncollege, approximately twice monthly by telephone and almost weekly by text messaging. \nApplicant and friend #2 now live in relatively close proximity, and they engage in outdoor \nrecreational activities or home-improvement projects together several times a year. \nApplicant has always been honest with friend #2, who has grown to appreciate Applicant\u2019s \n\u201csage feedback.\u201d Friend #2 would trust Applicant with his daughter\u2019s well-being. Applicant \nhas displayed passion about his work for a defense contractor and has informed friend # 2 \nabout his intention to abstain from recreational marijuana use. Friend #2 is supportive of \nthe decision and is confident Applicant will adhere to his convictions. He regards Applicant \nas an asset to national security because of the values, ethics, and passion Applicant has \nexhibited over the course of their 12-year friendship. (AE G.) \n \n \nApplicant is passionate about his work. Four months into his current job, Applicant\u2019s \njob performance was rated as high in some aspects, good in others, and exceptional in \nproviding support. Regarding the company\u2019s code of conduct and compliance with ethical \nprinciples, Applicant had demonstrated to his rating manager that he could be \u201ctrusted to \ndo what is right.\u201d (AE C.)  He had a very successful first year with his current employer. He \nwas singled out for his \u201cgreat performance so far\u201d and his outstanding support. His \nmanager and others recognized him as someone with \u201cgreat growth potential as both an \nindividual contributor and as a leader.\u201d Applicant\u2019s efforts in completing qualification testing \nled to his employer receiving several million dollars in progress payments during the 2017 \ncalendar year. He consistently displayed company-ethics principles in all of his interactions \nwith co-workers and was accountable for his actions at work. (AE B.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work supervisor since April 2018 first became acquainted with him in \nDecember 2016. They have worked on the same project since January 2018. One of his \nmany tasks requires a high level of attention to detail, and he is able to convey information \nclearly and concisely. She considers Applicant to be one of her highest performers and an \nasset to national security. He is sought after by multiple teams because of his ability to \nwork well with any group. He completes his work on time and has been willing to work \n\n7 \n \nextended hours to solve complex problems. (AE F.) At his mid-year performance review in \nAugust 2018, she described Applicant as an \u201cexcellent example of a model systems \nengineering employee.\u201d (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant asserts that he told his current supervisor that he was being investigated \nfor marijuana use. (Tr. 49.) No other co-workers are aware of his drug use, although he \nnow indicates that he would acknowledge his drug use if asked. He does not intend to \nvolunteer the information unless the circumstances warrant it. He is not ashamed of his \nmarijuana involvement, but \u201cthere are obvious professional consequences of that \nreputation growing beyond what is necessary.\u201d (Tr. 62.) Applicant did not inform his facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) about his drug use while holding a security clearance because it has \nnot impacted his ability to serve in his professional capacity. He used marijuana only one \ntime during his present employment. (Tr. 63.) When asked whether he felt that his breach \nof his employer\u2019s drug policy should have been disclosed to his FSO at his previous and \ncurrent defense-contractor employments, Applicant responded that he had never denied \nhis use and would have informed his security officer in the case of an arrest. (Tr. 64.) \nApplicant acknowledged that he had received training at work about substance abuse, but \nhe did not consider his behavior as abuse. Marijuana never served as a crutch for him, and \nhe was not dependent on the drug. (Tr. 80.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n8 \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, approximately 234 times total, \nfrom June 2002 to January 2009. After telling an OPM investigator in April 2009 that he did \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future, he was granted a DOD secret clearance in May \n2009. While working for a defense contractor and possessing a security clearance, he \nresumed using marijuana in December 2009. Thereafter, he used marijuana three to four \ntimes a year with two college friends until March 2016. Applicant indicated in January 2017 \nthat he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, but he used it with the same two \nfriends in August 2017. When interviewed in February 2018 for his latest background \ninvestigation, he could not commit to discontinuing his marijuana use because smoking the \ndrug with these two friends is something they do together and have done so for a decade. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition),\u201d AG \u00b6 \n25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and \n\n9 \n \nsubstance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such use,\u201d \napply. Applicant admitted during an April 2009 personal subject interview that he \npurchased and sold marijuana on occasion to friends while in college. Whereas his illegal \npurchases and sales of marijuana were not alleged in the SOR, they cannot be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d applies in that he had possession of marijuana when he \nused it, however. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was part of his recreational \nlifestyle in college and, by his own admission, something that he and friends #1 and #2 did \ntogether while socializing from December 2009 to March 2016 and again in August 2017. It \nwas too recurrent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides for mitigation when an individual acknowledges his or her drug \ninvolvement and has no intention of future drug activity: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant executed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug use \nin the future, which is required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). His candor about his \ndrug involvement allows me to accept as credible his statement of intent to completely \nabstain from marijuana in the future and his claim of no marijuana use since August 2017. \nEven so, I cannot ignore that he has not abided by his previous assertions that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. In April 2009, he told an OPM investigator that his \nmarijuana use would not carry over after he graduated from college because he did not \nwant marijuana to affect his career. On his January 2017 SF 86, he indicated that his use \nof marijuana was \u201ca phase\u201d that he had outgrown, and that he had no intentions of \nrevisiting that behavior. Applicant continues to associate with friends #1 and #2 from \ncollege with whom he used marijuana from December 2009 to March 2016 and again in \nAugust 2017. As recently as February 2018, Applicant could not say that he would not use \nmarijuana again with friends #1 and #2. While acknowledging the reduced frequency of his \nmarijuana use since college, a \u201ctrend\u201d away from marijuana which he submits has instilled \n\n10 \n \nconfidence in his ability to abstain, Applicant was well aware that marijuana use was \nprohibited of defense contractor employees holding a security clearance. Both friends #1 \nand #2 indicate that Applicant has told them that he intends to abstain from recreational \nmarijuana use, and they expressed their support of that decision. However, under the \ncircumstances, a longer period of abstention is required before I can conclude with \nconfidence that his marijuana use is behind him and will not reoccur. The drug involvement \nsecurity concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nConcerning the Government\u2019s case for disqualification under the personal conduct \nguideline because of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while he held an active security clearance \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), the Appeal Board has held that security-related conduct can be considered \nunder more than one guideline, and in an appropriate case, be given independent weight \nunder each. See ISCR Case No. 11-06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). Applicant exercised \n\u201cquestionable judgment\u201d within the general security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15 when he \nrepeatedly used marijuana while holding a secret clearance. Separate from the risk of \nphysiological impairment associated with the use of a mood-altering substance, which is a \nGuideline H concern, Applicant had an obligation as a clearance holder to comply with the \nDOD\u2019s and his employer\u2019s policies prohibiting illegal drug use. AG \u00b6 16(d) provides:  \n  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself of an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of:  \n  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  \n  \nApplicant was granted a DOD secret clearance in May 2009 after he had indicated \nthat his marijuana use would not continue after college. He knew when he resumed his \nmarijuana use in December 2009 that it was illegal as well as contrary to his obligations as \na clearance holder employed by a defense contractor. It is no justification that he used \nmarijuana only three to four times a year while working for his previous employer and only \n\n11 \n \none time in his present job. He admitted to an OPM investigator in February 2018 that he \nwas aware that his marijuana use in August 2017 was contrary to his employer\u2019s policies \nand that he could face disciplinary action if his employer learned about his marijuana use. \nNothing about the circumstances of his recreational marijuana use mitigates or justifies his \ndeliberate noncompliance with the DOD\u2019s and defense-contractor employers\u2019 policies. \nCuriosity about legal purchase and his celebratory mood do not adequately mitigate the \npoor judgment he exhibited in August 2017 when he and his friends illegally transported \nmarijuana across state lines and then illegally used it.  \n \nApplicant exhibited some reform under AG \u00b6 17(d) by admitting his marijuana use \nwhile holding a DOD clearance and by resolving not to use any illegal drug in the future. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) provides: \n  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nHowever, Applicant had expressed an intention in April 2009 to put his marijuana \nuse behind him. The Government relied on that intention and granted him a clearance. He \nbetrayed the Government\u2019s trust each time that he used marijuana thereafter, rationalizing \nthat it was not serious because it was limited in frequency and only with persons he \ntrusted. After several years of putting his self-interest ahead of his obligations as a \nclearance holder, he contends that he now can be counted on to abide by his commitment \nbecause of his signed statement to abstain, which he takes especially seriously. His \nJanuary 2017 SF 86 denial of any future intention to use marijuana was under the \nadvisement of Title 18, Section 1001, of the United States Code, which makes punishable \nas a felony offense any false statement. Assuming he did not then intend any future \nmarijuana use, he was on notice that future marijuana use was incompatible with his \nsecurity clearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to give due consideration to his obligations as a \ncleared individual continues to reflect adversely on his judgment and reliability. The \npersonal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).3 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(c), \n                                                 \n3 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \n\n12 \n \nApplicant\u2019s contributions to his employer weigh in his favor. Applicant\u2019s supervisor \nconsiders him to be one of her highest performers and an asset to national security. \nDedicated to his work, he is sought after by multiple teams because of his ability to work \nwell with any group. He completes his work on time and has been willing to work extended \nhours to solve complex problems. However, neither his work contributions nor his candid \ndisclosures about his marijuana use, including his admissions in 2018 that he could not \nrule out future marijuana use with his friends, entitle him to maintain his security clearance. \nThe Government can reasonably expect persons granted a security clearance to comply \nwith their obligations. Applicant was entrusted with a security clearance based on certain \ncriteria and conditions, including that he abide by the drug laws and remain abstinent from \nillegal drugs while maintaining his security clearance. Applicant was also obligated to report \nany transgressions as soon as practicable. See ISCR Case No. 11-12165 (App. Bd. Jan. \n29, 2014). Applicant has yet to advise any security personnel about his marijuana use \nbecause he regards his drug use as minimal, and it did not affect his work. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions. Yet it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The \nGovernment must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to \nfulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard \nto their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt \nin that regard to where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n13 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 8, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 5, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on December 5, \n2018. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant submitted a timely response and \nhis exhibits are marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. There were no \nobjections by Applicant or Department Counsel and all Items and exhibits are admitted \ninto evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 65 years old. He is married and has two adult children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2016. He has also earned several \ntechnical certificates.  \n \nApplicant disclosed on his August 2016 security clearance application (SCA) his \nemployment history as follows:  \n \nFrom May 2006-August 2007-employed in construction business; \nFrom August 2007 to June 2008-unemployed; \nFrom June 2008 to September 2009-employed;1 \nFrom September 2009 to February 2011-employed; \nFrom February 2011 to May 2015-unemployed-attending school, attempting to \nacquire clients for self-employment; and \nFrom May 2015 to the present-self-employed.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts. Five are judgments entered from 2009 \nto 2013; including 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$4,005); 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b-$3,619); 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.c-\n$21,810); 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.d-$2,858); and 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.e-$13,472). It also alleges a \ncollection account debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f with a balance of $5,306 for a credit card, and a \ndelinquent state tax debt from 2005 in the amount of $18,160 in SOR \u00b6 1.g. All of the \nalleged debts total $69,230. Applicant\u2019s admissions and a September 2016 credit report \ncorroborate the debts alleged in the SOR.3  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to the economic downturn in 2007-\n2008. He worked in the construction business at the time and this impacted his \nemployment. In his SOR answer, he stated that in 2006 he planned to purchase property \nand build a new house. He intended to use the equity in his old house to pay down a \nconstruction loan and reduce his mortgage payments. When the construction of the new \nhouse was completed, his old house had been on the market for a year and had not sold. \n                                                          \n1 Item 3. Applicant also listed that from February 2009 to September 2009 he was unemployed. This is \ninconsistent with his other entry.  \n \n2 Item 3. \n \n3 Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A, B, C. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe converted his construction loan into a second mortgage. He stated that after two years \nand only one income, presumably his wife\u2019s, he had to do a short sale on the old house \nto sell it. He stated that by then, he had depleted his cash savings and pension.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that another factor impacting his \nfinances \u201cwas the loss of our records and return for the tax year 2005-2006.\u201d4 He stated:  \n \nNever before this particular year, or since, had we failed to file a return, and \nrarely did we owe taxes. Nevertheless, the return was apparently never filed \nand by the time we found out about it, the interest and penalties were high. \nWe could only pay for either the federal or the state taxes at one time so we \nopted to pay the federal debt first, which was recently satisfied. We currently \nhave an agreement to make payments on the state taxes.5 \n \nApplicant did not provide specific information as to when he learned his income \ntax filing for 2005 was delinquent or an explanation for why he did not address the \ndelinquent state tax debt for 12 years. He provided a document from the state tax office \nshowing in February 2017, he entered into an installment agreement to pay $341 a month \nfor 60 months beginning in March 2017. In his response to the SOR, he provided a \ndocument from the state tax office that shows he has reduced the balance owed on the \n$18,160 debt to $9,502 as of December 2018.6  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that due to his age and eyesight, employment \nin the housing industry is not feasible even if a position was available. He is self-employed \nand his income is much lower than it was in 2006.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he explained that his strategy to resolve his \ndebts was to negotiate lower payments and temporarily suspend paying some creditors \nwhile paying his main obligations. This became untenable, and he suspended paying \ncreditors with unsecured debts, such as those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f. He \nexplained that his financial problems are not due to lack of self-control or poor judgment. \nHe has not sought bankruptcy protection. He intends to satisfy all of his debts when he \nhas the means.7 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he noted that the creditors alleged in the \nSOR are not the original creditors because the delinquent debts were sold. He believes \nthe balances are inflated. He stated he will continue to negotiate payment of the debts. \nApplicant did not provide any documentary evidence of actions he has taken to negotiate, \nresolve, settle, or pay the judgments and collection debt alleged in the SOR. He did not \n                                                          \n4 Item 2. \n \n5 Item 2.  \n \n6 Item 6; AE B, C. \n  \n7 Item 2.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nindicate if he has contacted any of the creditors. Applicant did not provide specific details \nabout his income. He did not provide information about whether his wife is employed, her \nincome, or if he provides support to others. He did not provide information about whether \nhe has a budget and his current expenses. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report from April \n2018 reports he has approximately 13 revolving accounts to which he is making current \nmonthly payments with a total cumulative balance of approximately $37,572. In addition, \nhe is making payments on three student loans totaling approximately $21,481, and a \nmonthly mortgage payment of approximately $2,849.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n                                                          \n8 Item 4; AE A. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation.10 \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n                                                          \n10 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App.Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has five unpaid judgments from 2009 to 2013 and a collection account \ntotaling approximately $51,068. He has a delinquent tax debt from tax year 2005 in the \namount of $18,160. He has a history of being unable to pay or manage his debts. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant has unpaid judgments and a collection account. He has an installment \nagreement to pay his delinquent state tax debt. His delinquent financial obligations are \nrecent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the economic downturn that impacted \nthe construction industry in 2007-2008. He also attributes it to being underemployed. \nThese factors were beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly under the circumstances. It has been more than 10 years \nsince the economic downturn. Applicant has a tax debt from 2005 and judgments that \nwere entered beginning in 2009. He did not provide evidence of any action he may have \ntaken to pay, settle, or resolve any of the judgments or the collection account alleged in \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe SOR. He did not provide an explanation for why he did not arrange an installment \nagreement with his state tax authority for his 2005 state income taxes until 2017. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has minimal application.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling and that his \ndebts are under control. There is no evidence he has made a good-faith effort to repay \nthe judgments or otherwise resolve his delinquent collection debts. His delayed action in \naddressing his delinquent 2005 state income tax debt does not constitute a good-faith \neffort. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to Applicant\u2019s state tax \ndebt. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 65 years old. His financial problems began in 2007-2008 when the \neconomy impacted the construction industry. Applicant had periods of underemployment. \nIt was not until February 2017 that he entered an installment agreement to pay delinquent \nstate taxes from 2005. He has five judgments entered from 2009 to 2013. He did not \nprovide evidence that he has contacted his creditors and made efforts to resolve his \ndebts. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.
