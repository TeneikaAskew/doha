Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 2, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct) and Guideline I (Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2 and 4-8 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A-S were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant objected to GE \n3, which is a July 2021 summary of psychological evaluation conducted by a licensed \npsychologist at the referral of the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF). He \nargued that he did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the psychologist because \nDepartment Counsel did not produce her as a witness at the hearing. I overruled \nApplicant\u2019s objection and admitted GE 3 in evidence. Applicant testified. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I kept the record open until September 25, 2023, to allow him to submit additional \ndocumentation. By that date, he submitted documentation that I collectively marked as \nAE T and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 22, 2023.

He graduated from high school in 1985, and he \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990 and a master\u2019s degree in 2018. He married in 1995, \ndivorced in 2020, and remarried in 2022.

On the night of his bachelor \nparty, he got into a physical altercation with a fraternity brother. They resolved their \nconflict and remained friends. Unbeknownst to them, the charge remained pending in the \ncourt system until Applicant\u2019s friend requested its dismissal in 2012.

The soldier pushed him, and he choked the soldier to get the soldier out \nof his way. He reported the incident to his superior, and he was not disciplined for this \nincident. (Tr. 140-144; AE J) \nIn August 2002, while deployed to Bosnia, Applicant was the subject of an \ninvestigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division for aggravated assault. He was \non patrol with his team as the communications officer when some of the communications \nfailed. He returned to the military base and immediately approached the desk of the \ncivilian contractor, who was the lead communications help desk technician, to try to \ntroubleshoot the issues. He denied pulling his weapon from his holster, pointing it at, and \nverbally threatening this individual. Because he breached protocol by not properly \ndisarming his weapon upon returning to the base and approaching this individual\u2019s desk, \nhe disassembled it on the \u201chelp desk ledge.\u201d He did so while he was having a heated \nconversation with this individual wherein profanity was exchanged, and he warned that \nhe would elevate the communications failures to the individual\u2019s supervisor. (SOR \u00b6 1.d; \nTr. 41-50, 131-140, 158-163, 170-172; GE 2-3, 6, 8; AE J) \nApplicant testified that he recognized how his act of disassembling his weapon on \nthe help desk technician\u2019s ledge while they were having a heated conversation could have \nbeen perceived by this individual as an intimidation tactic or threat, but he stated that such \nwas not his intention. He and this individual had previous and reoccurring conflict with \neach other. He recalled later apologizing to this individual and voluntarily surrendering his \nweapon during the remaining two to three weeks of his deployment as an act of good \nfaith. He was not court-martialed, he did not receive an Article 15 non-judicial punishment, \nhe was not administratively reprimanded or counseled, and this incident did not have a \nnegative impact on his military career. (Tr. 41-50, 131-140, 158-163, 170-172; GE 2-3, 6, \n8; AE J) \nIn February 2015, Applicant was arrested in state C and charged with felony gun \npossession on education property, misdemeanor assault by pointing a gun, and \nmisdemeanor communicating threats. Between 2003 and 2005, he had purchased from \nthe military post exchange several firearms for which he had a non-residence conceal \nand carry permit from state B. The morning of his arrest in 2015, he intended to go to the \nfiring range with one of his firearms, so he disassembled it and put it, along with one \nmagazine, in a case that he then put in the trunk of his car. He also put a separate \nmagazine and ammunition in the trunk of his car, as they would not fit in his case. When \nhe went back inside his home to say good-bye to his then spouse, she was crying on the \nphone with his stepdaughter, who was attending college in state C. Concerned about \nreports that his stepdaughter was having loud parties, drinking excessively, and using \ndrugs, he changed his plans at his then spouse\u2019s request and drove from state A to state \nC to bring his stepdaughter home. He mistakenly did not think to remove his firearm from \nthe trunk of his car beforehand. (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-\n3, 5-6; AE E-H, J) \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter refused to cooperate with him when he arrived at her \napartment in state C.

As he was putting her \nbelongings in his car, her girlfriend saw his firearm, which had fallen out of its case that \nopened during his drive from state A to state C, as he was attempting to put it back in its \ncase. They got into a heated exchange, and he decided to leave and drive to his friend\u2019s \nhouse. (Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-3, 5-6; AE E-H, J) \nAs Applicant drove to his friend\u2019s house, his then spouse called and told him that \nthe police were looking for him. His stepdaughter\u2019s girlfriend reported that he \u201chad \nthreatened her by pointing a firearm at her and saying I was going to blow her head off or \nsomething to that extent,\u201d which he denied. He reacted to this news \u201cvery poorly.\u201d He did \nnot want to have any issues with the police, and although he had a firearm permit for state \nB, he did not remember that state C had reciprocity with state B for concealed handguns. \nHe drove into a parking lot that he did not know was on educational property, he loaded \nhis firearm with one of the magazines, and he hid it along with the additional magazine \nand ammunition under a bush. He stated that he loaded the firearm because he \u201cwas just \nputting it all together just to get all the evidence out of the car.\u201d The police pulled him over \nas he was driving to his friend\u2019s house, and when they questioned him about whether he \nhad a firearm, he replied that he did not. They put him in the police car, searched his car, \nand drove him to his stepdaughter\u2019s apartment for identification. There, they asked him \nwhere his gun was, and he cooperated and took them to the location where he had it \nhidden. The police recovered his gun, arrested and charged him, and he was released \non bail. The charges were voluntarily dismissed in March 2015 and expunged in February \n2016. (Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-3, 5-6; AE E-H, J) \nIn April 2017, Applicant was in a physical altercation with his then spouse. They \nconsumed alcohol at a friend\u2019s home earlier that evening and got into an argument upon \ntheir arrival at home. When their argument escalated, she struck him across his chest, \nthrew her cell phone at him, and hit him in the back as he walked away. He turned and \npunched her in the face, causing her to suffer an orbital fracture. No criminal charges \nwere filed against him. (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 62-67, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 155, 170-172; \nGE 2-3, 5-6; AE C, D, J, K, M, T) He testified: \n[U]nder no circumstances should a man ever hit a woman, no matter what \nthe situation is. No mater what the situation, you still have the choice to walk \naway. I did not exercise my choice to do so. I\u2019m extremely remorseful for \nwhat I did. (Tr. 64) \nThis incident led to a two-to-three-week period of separation between Applicant \nand his then spouse. He voluntarily took a 16-hour anger management class in April 2017, \nthrough which he learned coping skills and methods to de-escalate a situation. At his then \nspouse\u2019s request, he surrendered his firearms to the police and sought an evaluation from \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to determine if he suffered from PTSD. He \nsaw a VA doctor once, and he was not given a diagnosis. He also obtained a referral from \nhis general practitioner for a psychiatrist, whom he saw six to seven times over the course \nof four to five weeks in June or July 2017. This psychiatrist also did not give him a \ndiagnosis. He and his then spouse also attended marriage counseling, which he found \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nuseful.

(Tr. 65) \nIn approximately 2018, Applicant and his then spouse had multiple occasions \nwhere their son was \u201c. . . very disrespectful, using profanity, and . . . yelling,\u201d having \nremoved him from college because of poor grades, alcohol consumption, and drug use. \n(Tr. 146) Applicant recalled one incident where his son \u201cstruck me in the face with a closed \nfist,\u201d and another incident where his son \u201cpulled knife out on me asking to fight. So, I took \nhim and pushed him against a wall, and I asked him to . . . leave the house.\u201d His then \nspouse took their son and stayed with him at her daughter\u2019s apartment for a couple of \ndays. His son was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2021 or 2022. (Tr. 73, 146-147, 155-\n157) \nIn July 2019, Applicant engaged in another altercation with his then spouse. In \n2018, he replaced the firearms that he had previously surrendered, and on the morning \nof July 2019, he worked on one of his firearms in his garage. He subsequently placed the \nfirearm on a counter inside the home. When his then spouse finished preparing dinner \nthat evening, he secured the firearm in an upstairs safe. He denied having left the firearm \nin his garage and stated that his then spouse saw him take the firearm upstairs to secure \nit. Over dinner, they argued about an invitation to attend a neighbor\u2019s cookout. She \nwanted to attend but he did not, as he no longer desired that kind of environment and did \nnot like that this neighbor had previously made disparaging comments about her. Their \nargument continued as she followed him when he returned to his garage to work on one \nof his cars. (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 66-71, 100-119, 122-123, 155-156, 167-172; GE 2-3, 6-7; AE \nB, J) He testified: \nWe were in the garage initially. I did break the antenna off of a joint on the \ncar that we both owned, and I threw it out the garage. And I did kick the car \ntire, the actual rubber that touches the road. Both are very immature actions. \n(Tr. 69) \nApplicant\u2019s then spouse called the police and reported that he struck her with an \nantenna and pointed a firearm at her, which he denied. He was not arrested, and no \ncriminal charges were filed against him. Early the next morning, the sheriff\u2019s department \nserved him with a temporary 48-hour restraining order that was subsequently extended \nfor an additional week. He surrendered his firearms as required by the order. His then \nspouse also filed for divorce, at which point she pressed charges against him for second-\ndegree assault and malicious destruction of property and obtained a one-year protective \norder against him. He was ordered to pay for the property damage, the charges were \ndropped, and the records pertaining to this incident were expunged in August 2020. After \ntheir requisite one-year period of separation, their divorce was finalized in 2020.

He has a limited relationship with \nhis stepdaughter, due to her unfounded rape allegations against him during the divorce \nproceedings. Although Applicant and his spouse have disagreements, he stated that they \ndo not compare to those he had with his ex-spouse, to which he credits his spouse\u2019s calm \ndemeanor, their marriage, and his spirituality.

(SOR \u00b6 2.a; Tr. 148-149; GE 3) PSYCH 1 conducted her evaluation on July \n8, 2021, and she reported her findings on July 18, 2021. PSYCH 1 stated, as the basis \nfor her opinion, that \u201c[Applicant] has an extensive history of criminal behavior and legal \ninvolvement since the 1990s. Additionally, there is evidence that he has a pattern of \nbrandishing guns and becoming violent [and] aggressive when he is upset.\u201d (GE 3) \nPSYCH 1 also stated that her evaluation included \u201creview of background information, \nincluding medical and mental health treatment records provided by the DOD CAF\u201d and \n\u201c[a]dditional data was collected via clinical interview, testing observations, and \nadministration of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).\u201d (Tr. 148-149; GE 3) \nPSYCH 1 provided the following diagnostic impressions and prognosis: \nBased solely on [Applicant\u2019s] self-report, it would seem that he does not \ncurrently meet criteria for any diagnosable mental health conditions. \nHowever, when considering background information, clinical interview and \nobservations, and objective personality assessment, his diagnostic profile \nis as follows: \n309.81 \n[PTSD] \nV62.22 \nPersonal history of Military Deployment \nV62.5  \nProblems Related to Other Legal Circumstances \nWhile it is challenging to conclusively diagnose PTSD in a one-time \nevaluation, particularly if there is no supporting medical history, [Applicant\u2019s] \nbackground history is noteworthy for extensive criminal conduct and violent \nbehavior. Since the 1990s, he has demonstrated 1) irritable behavior and \nangry outbursts; 2) reckless behaviors; and 3) dissociative reactions in \nwhich he acts as if the traumatic event were recurring. These behaviors are \nsymptomatic of PTSD and have clearly negatively impacted his social and \noccupational functioning. (GE 3) \nPSYCH 1 concluded: \n[Applicant\u2019s] behavioral health history suggests several behaviors, which \ncast doubt on his judgment, reliability and/or trustworthiness. His history of \ninterpersonal volatility and legal involvement is concerning, and his limited \ninsight and pattern of grandiosity (in speech, thought, and behavior) may \nindicate a poor prognosis. Despite claims that he and his ex-spouse are on \namicable terms and a judge awarded him physical custody of their son, \nthese claims could not be independently verified and court records indicate \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat his [ex-]wife extended the no-contact protective order through at least \nJuly 2020.

(GE 3) \nApplicant was evaluated by another licensed psychologist (PSYCH 2) in January \n2023, on the advice of his attorney. PSYCH 2 stated that her evaluation included review \nof the SOR; PSYCH 1\u2019s July 18, 2021 summary of psychological evaluation; Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 19, 2022 response to interrogatories; and \u201c[m]iscellaneous records from \n[Applicant\u2019s] background investigation.\u201d (Tr. 123-131, 134-139, 152-154; AE I-J) PSYCH \n2 also stated that additional data was collected via \u201csemi-structured clinical interview, \nobservations, and administration of objective personality measure, the . . . [PAI] , and \nsubjective report of symptoms . . . .\u201d (Tr. 123-131, 134-139, 152-154; AE J) Applicant \nacknowledged that PSYCH 2 did not speak with any of his family or friends, to include his \nex-spouse. (Tr. 153-154) \nPSYCH 2 stated that Applicant \u201cdoes not appear to meet diagnostic criteria for any \nmental health conditions at this time,\u201d and she concluded that Applicant does not currently \nhave a mental health diagnosis that could cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \njudgment, or ability to safeguard sensitive or classified information. (Tr. 123-131, 134-\n139; AE J) PSYCH 2 stated: \nI did not find evidence to support a diagnosis of [PTSD]. While [Applicant] \nhas a history of military deployment, this does not independently cause a \nmental health condition. Additionally, although Applicant did endorse a \nnumber of individual items within his PAI that elevated a subscale \ncommensurate with traumatic events, upon further evaluation of those items \none finds reflection of reactions commensurate with frustration noted above \nrelated to his relationship with his ex-wife and the process that led to him \nlosing his security clearance. . . . (AE J) \nApplicant\u2019s 1995 simple assault charge, 2002 verbal and physical altercation with \na soldier, 2011 adjustment disorder diagnosis by the VA, and 2018 physical altercation \nwith his son were not alleged in the SOR, so they may not be an independent basis for \nrevoking Applicant\u2019s clearance. However, I may consider them to evaluate his credibility; \nto evaluate his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to decide \nwhether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide \nevidence for the whole-person analysis. I have considered these unalleged events for \nthese limited purposes. \nApplicant received numerous certificates and medals, to include a Meritorious \nService Medal for his service in Bosnia, a Bronze Star Medal for his service in \nAfghanistan, and a Legion of Merit medal upon his military retirement for exceptionally \nmeritorious service.

(Tr. 49-50; AE R) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard\nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to . . . ; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; . . . . \nApplicant engaged in personal conduct between 2002 and 2019, as discussed \nabove, which raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), 16(d)(1), and 16(d)(2) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following relevant conditions that could mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant engaged in problematic conduct between 1995 and 2019. He was in a \nphysical altercation with his fraternity brother in 1995. He choked another soldier in 2002, \nand he was in a heated exchange with a help desk technician while disassembling his \nweapon in Bosnia, which he acknowledged could have been perceived as an intimidation \ntactic or a threat. In 2015, he was in a heated exchange with his stepdaughter\u2019s girlfriend \nafter she saw his firearm in the trunk of his car, and he hid his loaded firearm, a separate \nmagazine, and additional ammunition, in a parking lot bush when he learned the police \nwere looking for him. In 2017, he was in a physical altercation with his then spouse and \nfractured her orbital bone. In 2018, he pushed his son against a wall. In 2019, he was in \na verbal altercation with his then spouse when he broke and threw a car\u2019s antenna and \nkicked its tires. His conduct over the past 24 years is not overcome by the fact that he \nhas not engaged in any such similar conduct since 2019, and it continues to raise doubts \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions   \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nIn July 2021, PSYCH 1 diagnosed Applicant with PTSD and concluded that his \nbehavioral health history cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(b) are established. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially relevant: \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nWhen the VA evaluated Applicant in 2010 and 2018, he was diagnosed only with \nan adjustment disorder in 2011. He was not diagnosed with PTSD. Since 2021, his 100% \ndisability rating from the VA has not been based on any mental health condition. In \nJanuary 2023, when PSYCH 2 evaluated him, she did not find evidence to support a \nPTSD or other mental health diagnosis that could cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. Although she did not speak with any of his family or friends, to \ninclude his ex-spouse, her evaluation included a review of the summary of psychological \nevaluation reported by PSYCH 1 as well as records pertaining to Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c), 29(d), and 29(e) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline E and \nGuideline I in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military \nservice and his favorable character references. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the psychological conditions security concerns, \nbut he failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After they broke up in October 2016, she bought him out in \nJanuary 2020. Since October 2016, he has lived with a cohabitant. Since March 2018, he \nhas worked for a federal contractor. He has been employed full time by federal contractors \nsince October 2001. (Items 3 and 5.)  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) is delinquent on eight \nconsumer debts totaling $45,655; (2) is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nfor $21,768 in unpaid taxes for tax years 2012 through 2015; (3) is indebted to his state \nfor $3,607 in unpaid taxes for tax year 2016; (4) failed to file federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2016 through 2021, and; (5) failed to file his state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2016 through 2021. (Item 1.) He admitted all allegations (except SOR \u00b6 1.g), with \nexplanations that will be discussed below. (Item 2.) \nIn his Answer, Applicant said he planned to retire some of his debts once he \nreceived a lump sum payout from his pension fund. (Item 2, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a., 1.d, 1.m, 1.n, \nand 1.o.) He did not explain when he might receive that payout. He failed to file state and \nfederal tax returns, because he knew he owed taxes and could not afford to pay them. \n(Item 2, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o.) His personal subject interview (PSI) reported that his debts \nwere not tied to events beyond his control. (Item 5 at 14.) \nHis personal financial statement (PFS) reported: total net monthly Income of \n$4,330; total monthly expenses of $1,645, and actual monthly expense payments of $573. \nHis monthly net remainder is $2,112. \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn 2016, my [fianc\u00e9e] and I ended our relationship and due to the \nextent of our bad relationship I chose to move out.

In addition to those bills, \nI was making payments to the IRS. I was concerned that if I filed my taxes \nright away and I owed money, I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to make the \npayments. My money was stretched thin, my ex-[fianc\u00e9e] successfully \napplied and was approved for a mortgage loan to solely purchase the house \n[in 2020], I no longer have to pay bills in my prior residence so I can now \nfile my taxes and pay off current debt. (Item 4 at 12.) \nConsumer Debts \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a 2020 charged off auto loan for $17,673. Applicant admitted this \ndebt, and his PSI reported that he is paying $300 per month. (Item 2; Item 5 at 12; Item \n7 at 2; Item 8 at 2.) He did not document prior payments or the current status of the debt. \nThis debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a 2020 charged off credit card for $11,250. Applicant admitted this \ndebt, and his PSI reported that he was making payments.

This debt is being resolved.   \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a 2020 charged off personal loan for $4,690. Applicant admitted this\ndebt with plans to pay it once he receives his pension payout. (Item 2.) Applicant\u2019s PSI \nreported that he was making payments on this debt. (Item 5 at 12.)  His most recent credit \nreports, however, show the same balance as previous credit reports with the last payment \nmade in October 2017. (Item 6 at 7; Item 7 at 3; Item 8 at 2.) This debt is unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a 2020 charged off personal loan for $4,681. Applicant admitted this \ndebt with plans to pay it once he receives his pension payout. (Item 2.) Applicant\u2019s PSI \nreported that he was making payments on this debt. (Item 5 at 12.)  His most recent credit \nreports, however, show the same balance as previous credit reports with the last payment \nmade in October 2017. (Item 6 at 6; Item 7 at 3; Item 8 at 2.) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a 2022 charged off account for $1,005. Applicant admitted this debt \nwith plans to pay it once he receives his pension payout. (Item 2.) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a credit card that went into collection in 2019 for $525. Applicant \ndenied this allegation and claimed it was paid in full. (Item 2.) He provided documents \nshowing payments of $50 and $75 on November 27, 2022, and December 11, 2022, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrespectively.

This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a credit card that became past due in 2022 for $714. Applicant \nadmitted this account and claimed that he has a payment arrangement to settle the full \nbalance. His most recent credit report shows a somewhat higher balance than the \nprevious credit report. (Item 6 at 9; Item 7 at 3.) He did not provide any documents \nshowing a payment arrangement. This debt is unresolved. \nThe most recent credit report shows delinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR. \nThere are two charged off accounts for $821 and $2,382. (Item 6 at 4, 8.) And there are \nthree past due accounts totaling $499. (Item 6 at 5, 9.) \nTax Delinquencies \nApplicant admitted owing federal income taxes for tax years 2012 through 2015 \nand failing to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2021. He stated \nthat he was currently making payments to the IRS (Item 2.) \nApplicant explained that in 2016, he and his then fianc\u00e9e broke up. He moved out \nof the house they owned together. He found another roommate, but that meant he had to \npay half of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s bills and half of his new roommate\u2019s bills. Money was tight. He \nfailed to file tax returns, because he knew he owed taxes and was already making \npayments to the IRS. (Item 4 at 12.)  \nApplicant provided IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2012 through 2015 in both his \ninterrogatory responses. (Item 4 at 26-31; Item 5 at 18-23.) Those show some payments \nmade, but the last payment is for tax year 2015 made on December 3, 2021 ($365). (Item \n5 at 23.) The Payment Detail he provided dated December 5, 2021, shows four payments \nfrom September 13, 2021, to September 12, 2022, with the latest payment made for tax \nyear 2014 on January 5, 2022. (Item 4 at 24.) Contrary to his Answer, there is no evidence \nhistory of timely payments being made on his federal tax debt. These debts are \nunresolved. \nApplicant admitted owing his state income taxes for tax year 2016 and failing to \nfile his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2021. (Item 2.) His \nplan is to file these returns and pay his taxes once he receives his lump sum pension \nbuyout. (Item 2.) The record shows these issues have not been addressed and are \nunresolved. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR consumer debts and tax delinquencies are established by \nApplicant's admissions, his IRS documents, and the Government's credit reports. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions \napply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment,..divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances); \n(d)  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Although Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to the breakup with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019 in 2016, his \nconsumer debts are of recent vintage, becoming delinquent mostly in 2020. In that \nsame year, his ex-fianc\u00e9e\u2019 was able to buy out his interest in the home they owned \ntogether. It is unexplained how being relieved of that financial burden caused him to \nbecome delinquent on eight consumer accounts and resulted in his unpaid federal \ntaxes going back four years before his 2016 breakup. His federal and state income \ntax issues and his consumer debts (with two exceptions) are continuing. The SOR \nallegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplicant has presented evidence that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are being resolved. \nTherefore, they are mitigated by condition AG \u00b6 20(d). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have also considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). AG \u00b6 20(b) has an \ninitial requirement. That is, an applicant\u2019s financial problems must have been the \nresult of conditions \u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. Thus, those conditions must have \ncaused the financial problems. \nIn this case, Applicant pointed to the breakup with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019 as a cause of \nhis financial problems. There is no doubt that ending the relationship with his \nbetrothed was financially difficult. Such an event is akin to a divorce or a separation \nand thus largely beyond his control. But here, his tax problems in 2012 preceded his \nbreakup in 2016 by four years. And his consumer debts became delinquent in 2020, \nfour years after the breakup and when his ex-fianc\u00e9e\u2019 had bought out his interest in \ntheir home. What is lacking is a nexus between his tax and consumer debt issues on \nthe one hand and his breakup on the other hand. The SOR allegations are not \nmitigated by AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant has not produced evidence that he has arrangements with the IRS \nor his state taxing authority to make payments and has been in compliance with such \narrangements. The SOR tax allegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(g). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nAs part of my application of our facts to the whole-person concept, I have \nconsidered facts that are not alleged in the SOR. Unalleged conduct cannot be an \nindependent basis for a denial. It can, however, be used to evaluate credibility and in the \nwhole-person concept. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). The \nfollowing facts will be considered for those limited purposes. The most recent credit report \nshows that Applicant has delinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR. There are two \ncharged off accounts for $821 and $2,382. And there are three past due accounts totaling \n$499. Although the total amount due is not substantial, given his record, I deem those \nfacts to reflect adversely on his financial reliability. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

At \nthe close of the evidence and after receiving the electronic transcript of the proceedings, \nI proposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.

The case file contains the complete information.] \nApplicant was terminated from a former employer on February 10, 2019, for \nallegations of: theft/embezzlement of at least $5,000; making unauthorized expenditures \nin the amount of $18,000; disrespectful treatment of subordinate employees; and \ndisrespectful treatment of customers. Applicant worked for over 15 years for a female \nemployer. This employer did not have great book-keeping standards. She oversaw the \nbusiness well into her 90s when she began to have medical issues. Around 2016, the \nemployer\u2019s niece and her niece\u2019s husband took over running the business. They were \ninterested in turning the business into a for-profit enterprise. They gave Applicant \nadditional duties of overseeing the financial operations in addition to her other duties. \nApplicant did not have a financial background. \nIn early 2019, Applicant had a legitimate disagreement with one of her \nsubordinates. After this occurred, the subordinate and another subordinate alleged that \nApplicant was mishandling money from the business for her own gain. The niece\u2019s \nhusband launched an investigation and concluded Applicant mishandled funds and \nembezzled money. Based on his conclusions, Applicant was terminated for cause. \nDuring the hearing, the niece\u2019s husband testified, Applicant testified, two former \ncustomers who knew and worked with Applicant testified, and Applicant\u2019s mother \ntestified. Upon review of the testimony and case file, the evidence consisted of hearsay \nstatements and unfounded allegations. While the niece\u2019s husband sincerely believes \nApplicant embezzled funds from the business, the evidence was insufficient to conclude \nApplicant mishandled or embezzled funds. At most, there was evidence of negligence \ndue to poor bookkeeping. \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified a September 23, 2019, electronic \nquestionnaires for investigations processing application in response to Section 13 A \u2013 \nEmployment Activities when she did not list that she was terminated for cause from her \nprevious employment. She listed that she left by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance. She also provided the contact information of her former \nemployer\u2019s niece, who along with her husband was the one who terminated her. I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that she was \u2018terminated for cause\u201d was not \ndeliberate. There was no indication that she intended to mislead the government about \nher employment history. \nI find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 2.a for Applicant. I note the favorable references \nApplicant received. I also note that Applicant was hired by a DoD contractor in May \n2019. Her duty performance is excellent and she is highly regarded by her supervisor. \nShe lives with her parents and has no financial issues. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that Applicant provided \nsubstantial evidence to disprove the allegations. The evidence is insufficient to create \ndoubt about her reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He told the investigator that he failed \nto pay any taxes for \u201c2004/2005\u201d. He said he had not paid his taxes because he just hated \ndoing it. He understood he may owe penalties. He said he did not file returns because he \ndid not owe any taxes at the time. He received numerous letters from both his state \ngovernment and the IRS regarding unpaid taxes. In May 2010, his wages were garnished \nby the IRS for $10,000 of unpaid taxes for tax years 2005 and 2006. He told the \ninvestigator that he had federal liens on his property for failing to pay his federal income \ntaxes. Once he satisfied the tax debt through the garnishment, the liens were removed. \nHe was going to try and recoup some of this money with the help of an attorney.

He said he failed to do so \nbecause he was lazy. He was notified by letter from the homeowner\u2019s association that a \nlien might be placed on his property for failing to pay. Applicant paid the dues and avoided \nthe lien. He admitted this was not the first time he was late paying these dues. (Item 4) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2020. He told \nthe investigator that he did not file his tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019 because \nhe did not get around to it, and he was lazy. He said he was working with a commercial \ncompany to help him file his delinquent returns. He did not know if he owed taxes, but he \nwould pay what he owed. (Item 4) \nApplicant also disclosed to the investigator during his 2020 interview that in 2013 \nhe had not paid his homeowner\u2019s association fees for four to five months. He eventually \npaid the amount due. He said his failure to pay these dues was due to forgetfulness. He \nvolunteered that he was five months behind in paying his homeowner\u2019s association dues. \nHe intended to pay the delinquent amount. In his SOR answer, he said he paid this debt, \nand it will not happen again. He did not provide corroborating evidence he has paid this \ndebt. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories, he stated the following: \nUnfiled 2010 through 2015 federal income tax returns were \u201cbeing \nnegotiated\u201d by OTR (a tax service he hired). \n \nFederal income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2019 were filed in \nApril 2022. He said it was unknown how much he owed. \n \nState income tax returns for 2014, 2015, 2020 and 2021 will be filed in April \n2022. \n \nFederal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 will be filed in April \n2022.  \n \nOTR is working on a repayment agreement for federal taxes owed. \nApplicant stated in his interrogatory response that he had doubts whether he \nneeded to file his 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal and state income tax returns. He did not \nsay why. He said he needed to research it. He explained that the reason he has failed to \ntimely file his tax returns is because of neglectfulness, and he is not a great financial \nmanager. He believed he always had sufficient withholdings that would exceed his tax \nliability, and he would be entitled to refunds. \nIRS tax transcripts from April 2022 for tax years 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, \n2016, 2015, 2014 show no tax return had been filed.

There was no information \nreported for balances owed for tax years 2014 through 2021. (Item 4) \nIn response to interrogatories about Applicant\u2019s state tax returns, he stated that he \nfiled the returns for tax years 2014 through 2020 in April 2022. He believed he was entitled \nto refunds. \nApplicant did not provide any supporting documents to show he filed any of the \ndelinquent federal or state income tax returns. He did not provide any corroborating \nevidence that he has paid his delinquent taxes, is negotiating payment agreements, or \nhas hired a tax service. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated he earns approximately $168,000 \nannually. He owns a townhouse valued at $800,000, which has no mortgage. He said he \nopted to purchase a smaller house because he is debt averse, and he does not like to \nowe money. He purchased a 2017 Corvette two years ago with cash. He said he has \nbeen working with a tax service since March 2021 and has agreed to pay his federal tax \nbill in a single payment, which he estimated was approximately $36,000. \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.d, the SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s home was foreclosed upon in 2018. In \nhis answer, he stated: \nI don\u2019t recall this event, but I ADMIT that this may well have happened. I \nbelieve that this foreclosure would have been driven by my HOA, not my \nmortgage company. I paid up those dues to a debt collector. On August 18 \nof that same year, I paid off the mortgage to [Lendor] with a $76,890.48 \ncredit union check. (Item 2) \nApplicant\u2019s July 2020 credit reports reflect his mortgage account was being \nforeclosed due to payments 180 days past due. His August 2023 credit report shows he \nmade a payment of $76,890 for late payments. There is no updated evidence to \ncorroborate the mortgage is foreclosed. (Items 5, 6) \nApplicant stated in his SOR that he has held a security clearance for 46 years and \nhas never failed to recognize the gravity of the privilege nor given anyone reason to \ndoubt his allegiance to the United States. He said he is not susceptible to manipulation \nby any foreign power or subversive interest. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has repeatedly failed to pay his HOA dues and did not provide evidence \nthey are current. they remain delinquent. He repeatedly failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2004 to 2020. He failed to timely pay taxes owed between \n2004 through 2014. In 2010, his accounts were garnished to satisfy tax liens for \ndelinquent taxes. He is currently indebted to the IRS in the approximate amount of at least \n$20,892 for tax years 2010 through 2014. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he has paid or attempted to pay \nany of his delinquent taxes. During his 2014 background interview, he admitted to not \nfiling his income tax returns for multiple years and having his accounts garnished to satisfy \ntax liens. This should have been a wake-up call to Applicant that his timely filing and \npaying his taxes is an important part of his clearance viability. Instead, he said he was \nlazy and failed to comply with the rules regarding filing and paying his taxes. He repeated \nthe same conduct with paying his HOA dues, requiring the association to take legal action \nagainst him. Applicant proudly mentions that his home is paid, he purchased a high-end \nsport car, and he has sufficient resources; all while failing to note that he has not complied \nwith his legal responsibilities to file and pay his taxes. He provided statements that he has \nfiled some tax returns, is working with a tax service, and is planning to pay a lump sum of \n$36,000 to resolve his tax debt. However, he failed to provide corroborating \ndocumentation for any of the statements he made. Even if he did, he has spent years \nignoring his legal responsibilities. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nI find in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding SOR \u00b6 1.d which alleged his home was \nforeclosed. Although the process may have started, it appears he satisfied the amount \nowed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. He has a poor financial track \nrecord of paying his HOA dues and complying with rules and regulations associated with \nhis duty to file his tax returns and pay his income taxes. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 2.c, and 2.e. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d, and 3.a. These admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He has worked as an imagery analyst for a government contractor since 2019. He graduated high school in 2010. He served on active duty in the Air Force from 2014-2019 and received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1) Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges in \u00b6 1.a that Applicant failed a urinalysis test for marijuana in May 2018, while serving in the Air Force, and received an Article 15 and a general discharge for this conduct. It alleges in \u00b6 2.b that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency in May 2018 while holding a sensitive position. The SOR cross-alleges both of these allegations under Guideline E in \u00b6 3.a. Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan from December 2017 through April 2018, and served as a drone controller in combat operations.

At the end of the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR a third time to add a new allegation: \nSOR \u00b6 2.e \u2013 Applicant received mental health treatment at Facility C from August \n2021 to present and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. \nThe motion to amend the SOR was granted without objection, and Applicant \nadmitted the allegation. (Tr. 118-119) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 2.c, and 2.e. He denied SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d, and 3.a. These admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has worked as an imagery analyst for a government \ncontractor since 2019. He graduated high school in 2010. He served on active duty in the \nAir Force from 2014-2019 and received a general discharge under honorable conditions. \n(Tr. 16-18; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges in \u00b6 1.a that Applicant failed a urinalysis test \nfor marijuana in May 2018, while serving in the Air Force, and received an Article 15 and \na general discharge for this conduct. It alleges in \u00b6 2.b that Applicant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency in May 2018 while holding a sensitive position. The SOR cross-alleges \nboth of these allegations under Guideline E in \u00b6 3.a. \nApplicant was deployed to Afghanistan from December 2017 through April 2018, \nand served as a drone controller in combat operations. This position created a lot of \npressure on him and made him feel personally responsible for the consequences of his \nwork. He witnessed injury and death to servicemembers and civilians in wartime. He also \nexperienced other instances of trauma while in Afghanistan, including a physical assault \nand loss of a family member to suicide. (Tr. 16-51) \n2 \n\n \n \n \nWhen Applicant returned from his deployment, he went on leave for about two \nweeks and reported having post-traumatic stress. He was drinking to cope with his \nfeelings and was offered marijuana by patrons of the bar he visited. He did not know these \npersons well at the time of the incident and has had no further contact with them after his \nleave ended in May 2018. In his interview with a government investigator in July 2020, he \nreported using marijuana a few of times in his parents garage that week as well.

After \nthis incident, he attended the Air Force Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Treatment \nProgram (ADAPT), where he received substance abuse training and was taught \nstrategies to prevent him from self-medicating. He had not used marijuana or illegal drugs \nbefore or after his marijuana use in May 2018. This drug use was an isolated event and \nwas used as a form of self-medication. He stated he was not prepared for the gravity of \nhis experiences in Afghanistization, struggled to adjust upon his return, and did not have \na proper coping strategy. He requested retention in the Air Force, but nine months after \nthe urinalysis he was separated. (Tr. 18-51) \nApplicant asserted that he has been honest about his marijuana use and signed a \nstatement of intent to not reuse illegal drugs. He provided a clean drug testing screen \nfrom July 2022. He reported that he has no temptation to use marijuana again, and his \nsignificant other and his entire social circle work in cleared positions and do not engage \nin drug use. (Tr. 18-51; Answer) \nUnder Guideline I, the SOR alleges the following: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged Applicant had inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment \nat Facility A from July 2018 to October 2018, he was diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder, \nand was prescribed medication to treat his condition. He reported that prior to his positive \nurinalysis, he started having suicidal ideations. He reported he had a suicidal ideation \nwhile deployed. He stated that life in the Air Force was too stressful, and when he returned \nfrom deployment, he had another suicidal ideation. He was initially put under 24-hour \nwatch and sent to Facility A for out-patient care. He did that treatment for about three \nweeks. After a bad day, he was told to go to in-patient care, which lasted three weeks. \nWhen he was discharged from the inpatient program, he soon felt he needed to return to \nout-patient care, which lasted for about five more weeks, before he started care on base \nat facility B. (Tr. 58-111; GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleged Applicant received mental health treatment on base at Facility \nB from June 2018 to February 2019. There he was diagnosed with Borderline Personality \nDisorder, was prescribed medication to treat his condition, and was advised to continue \nmental health treatment. Applicant reported that he was given lots of medications while \nat Facility A. The doctors at Facility B changed one of his medications and gave him a \ndifferent diagnosis. Applicant questioned these changes. He reported that he worked with \nseveral different doctors between the facilities and had received conflicting advice.

(Tr. 58-111; GE 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleged Applicant was evaluated by a DoD-connected psychologist in \nAugust 2021. The evaluator diagnosed him with Borderline Personality Disorder and \nCluster B personality. The evaluator\u2019s report stated concern with Applicant\u2019s judgment, \ndecision making, and ability to adhere to rules and regulations. The evaluator met with \nhim for about two hours over a video-teleconference call. She found concern with his \nmental health history, use of alcohol, and failure to continue with counseling or treatment \nfor issues other than ADHD. She believed these issues could cause impairment with \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and mental stability. She stated that his prognosis \nwas poor. Applicant stated that his interactions with the evaluator were stressful, and he \nwas nervous. He does not agree with her conclusions and relies on the advice of his \ncurrent counselor. (Tr. 58-111; GE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleged that despite medical advice, Applicant failed to obtain ongoing \nand consistent mental health treatment and continue taking medications to treat his \nmental health conditions since February 2019. The basis of this allegation is undermined \nby the allegation and facts of SOR \u00b6 2.e. Therefore, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n(GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleged Applicant received mental health treatment at Facility C from \nAugust 2021 to present and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Applicant testified that \nhe had difficulty finding mental health providers after leaving the Air Force. When the \nCOVID-19 pandemic started, providers were not seeing new patients, which made the \nsituation harder to find someone. He was able restart mental health treatment in August \n2021, and has had mental health counseling since that time. His initial treatment was for \nADHD, but it evolved to address mood, anxiety, and depression. He has also taken \nmedication to treat his condition. These medications include a mood stabilizer, an anti-\npsychotic, and he has an anti-anxiety medication for use as needed. He reported that \ncounseling, setting routines, and a daytime work schedule have made these conditions \nmanageable. His counselor is not providing psychotherapy, but rather helps him manage \nmedication, reviews his journal and how he did over the preceding month. He reported \nthat he had three psychotherapy sessions with another provider in 2022. (Tr. 18-111) \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he has been working with his \ncurrent counselor since January 2022. The counselor reported that he has attended his \nscheduled appointments, and has been committed to his treatment plan and taking his \nprescribed medications. She stated that his actions displayed responsibility and \ndedication to his health and wellbeing. (Tr. 18-51; AE A) \nApplicant reported that he still experiences mood swings, but it\u2019s getting better over \ntime. He cut out a lot of stressors, which has helped him. He acknowledged that he still \nhas progress to make in his mental health wellness, but he no longer has extreme highs \nor lows. He also reported that he has been out of work from June through September \n2023. He has used short term disability to work on his mental health and bi-polar issues. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAs of the date of the hearing, he had not returned to work.

He still has occasional thoughts of self-harm, but only quarterly. \nHe meets with his counselor three times a month and feels ready to get back to work. \n(Tr. 58-116) \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he was awarded a commendation \nmedal for his work in Afghanistan. He also submitted four character letters from work \ncolleagues, which state that he is reliable, trustworthy, and fit to hold a security clearance. \nHe submitted a character letter from his significant other, who has known him for eight \nyears, and has worked and lived with him. She states that she has never seen him under \nthe influence of drugs or with drugs in his possession. She asserted that he is reliable, \nstable, and trustworthy, and fit to hold a security clearance. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical or mental impairment or \nare used in a manner inconsistent with their intended use can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to \nphysical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance \nmeans any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, \npossess, or distribute certain drugs (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. \nSee \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their \naccepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical \neffects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled \nsubstance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and \nno accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana while on leave from the Air Force in May 2018, \nand testing positive in a urinalysis when he returned to duty, which led to an Article 15 \nand eventual discharge from the Air Force. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(f) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies. Applicant used marijuana a few times over a weeklong period, \nmore than six years ago. He did not use marijuana before or after that time. At that time, \nhe had just returned from a combat deployment where he experienced trauma and had \npost-traumatic stress. He admitted that he was inappropriately self-medicating and made \na mistake. He attended substance abuse training at the Air Force ADAPT program and \nmarijuana use has not recurred. This no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to find that he \ndisassociated from drug using associates and contacts, and changed the environment \nwhere marijuana was used. He provided a signed statement to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and the following is \npotentially applicable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe SOR cross-alleges the Guideline H allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under \nGuideline E in SOR \u00b6 3.a. These allegations are considered under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c). \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies. Applicant used marijuana a few times over a weeklong period, \nmore than six years ago. He did not use marijuana before or after that time. He had just \nreturned from a combat deployment where he experienced trauma and had post-\ntraumatic stress. He admitted that he was inappropriately self-medicating and made a \nmistake. He attended substance abuse training at the Air Force ADAPT program and \nmarijuana use has not recurred. This no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for psychological conditions under \nAG \u00b6 28 and the following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes the concern that Applicant\u2019s behavior and diagnosed \nconditions could impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. He was \ndirected to obtain mental health treatment and was involuntarily hospitalized. At times, he \nhas failed to follow a prescribed treatment plan or continue with any mental health \ntreatment. He continues to work on his mental health issues. AG \u00b6 28(a), (b), (c), and (d) \napply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) do not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his condition is under control or in remission, or that he is now \nstable. His counselor provided a short letter praising his efforts in his mental health \ntreatment plan, but she did not provide a formal prognosis. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to rebut the Government\u2019s evidence regarding his mental health \ncondition. There is sufficient evidence to find that a mental health concern still exits. \nApplicant has skills and experience in an area of national security that is important \nto the government. His desire to continue to serve in a civilian role is admirable. The \nrecord shows that Applicant is working to establish stability and find the best methods to \nmanage his mental health. Once his condition is managed and he has a track record of \nstability, he will be eligible to reapply for a clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have considered his military service, his service to the \ngovernment as a civilian contractor, and his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H, E, and I in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline I. The security concerns under Guidelines \nH and E are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c, 2.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 37, 71-78; AE K, L, \nO, P) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has failed to show that she took any substantive action on her student \nloans after they became due in 2017. She failed to adequately explain how she was going \nto start resolving these loans once the COVID payment pause is lifted. The $32 monthly \nsample repayment plan she submitted would take 613 years to address only the principal \non these loans. This is not a good-faith attempt to resolve this debt. She did not resolve \nSOR \u00b6 1.b until right before the hearing, and she did not take action to verify the debts \nshe claimed not to recognize until about a week before the hearing. These late actions \nare not mitigating. She failed to provide sufficient evidence showing that she has made \npayments on her other debts. I cannot find that she has made good-faith efforts to resolve \nher finances. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the debts (other than SOR \u00b6 1.b) are resolved, or that any became \ndelinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Her failure to pay her \ndelinquent debts is both long-term and recent. Although she has recently paid one of the \nSOR debts, the rest are ongoing and unresolved. Her delinquent debts continue to cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. While the end of Applicant\u2019s third marriage and her \nreduced salary during her sick leave in 2020 impacted her ability to repay her debts, she \ndid not provide sufficient evidence showing that her debts became delinquent largely due \nto circumstances beyond her control or that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. The judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d occurred outside the timeframe of the \nfinancial abuse and the periods of reduced salary. She did not provide sufficient evidence \nshowing that she has acted responsibly in regard to her finances since at least 2017. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant only resolved one of the alleged debts, and \nshe only did so within a month prior to the hearing. She did not provide sufficient evidence \nshowing that she had made a good-faith effort to resolve her other debts or that she had \na track record of payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nestablishing a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of any of the SOR debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered her character letter. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. She did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. This decision should not be \nconstrued as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform \nnecessary for eligibility for a public trust position in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na public trust position.

A hearing was scheduled for \nDecember 20, 2023, via Microsoft Teams, Teleconference Services and was heard as \nscheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of eight exhibits. (GEs 1-8) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and 11 exhibits (AEs A-K). The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on January 5, 2024. \n Procedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with a resume, child support \npayments, a monthly budget, and an alcohol diagnosis. For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted 22 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was \nafforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the \nrecord with excerpts of his medical record, current child support status, and a personal \nbudget. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted as AEs L-N without \nobjections.

Allegedly, his delinquent debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly (a) violated Art. 92 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) for drinking underage in April 2001, and again in May 2001; (b) \nwas arrested in or around March 2002 for underage possession of alcohol and was \nfound guilty as charged; (c) was subjected to an Art. 92 UCMJ in August 2002 for \ndrinking underage and also violated Art. 111 of the UCMJ for driving while under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DuI); (d) was arrested for DuI in January 2015 and was sent to pre-\ntrial diversion;  (e) was arrested for DuI in or around January 2016 and was sent to pre-\ntrial diversion; and (f) was arrested for DuI in or around December 2018 and sent to pre-\ntrial diversion. Allegedly, these offenses represent a pattern of alcohol abuse incidents. \nAllegations made under Guidelines F and G are incorporated under Guideline E. \nAdditional allegations are advanced under Guideline E as follows: In or around August \n2020, Applicant was terminated by his then employer due to an inappropriate \nrelationship with a subordinate employee and a violation of his then employer\u2019s code of \nethics policy. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications.

Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in July 2004 and divorced in March 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 74-75) He \nhas two children (ages 13 and 16) from this marriage. Since March 2020, he has \nresided with his fianc\u00e9e who has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 30) Applicant earned a high \nschool diploma in June 2000. (GE 1) He attended college classes between November \n2004 and December 2005 without earning a degree or diploma. He resumed his college \nclasses in January 2008 and earned an associate\u2019s degree in May 2011. (GE 1) \nApplicant enlisted in the Marine Corps in October 2000 and served four years of active \nduty. (GE 1) He received an honorable discharge in December 2004. \nSince December 2020, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. \n(GE 1) Previously, he worked for other employers in various jobs. (GE 1) He was \nterminated in August 2020 by the former employer he worked for between January 2015 \nand August 2020 over an inappropriate relationship he had with a subordinate \nemployee in violation of his then employer\u2019s code of ethics policy. (GE 1) He reported \nunemployment between August 2020 and December 2022. (GE 1) He expressed some \nuncertainty over whether he has ever held a security clearance, but believed he held a \nclearance with a previous employer. (GE 1; Tr. 52-53) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2015 and 2021, Applicant accumulated 10 delinquent accounts \nexceeding $34,000. (GEs 2-5) The SOR debts are listed as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (an \nindividual loan account for $12,857); 1.b (an individual credit card account for $2,575); \n1.c (an individual loan account for $2,336), 1.d (an individual credit card account for \n$1,421); 1.e (an individual credit card account for $1,150); 1.f (a child support account \nfor $9,372); 1.g (an individual credit card account for $2,669); 1.h (an individual credit \ncard account for $2,495); 1.i (an individual consumer account for $247); and 1.j (an \nindividual credit card account for $1,303).  \nApplicant attributed his debt delinquencies to his prior divorce and ensuing child \nsupport obligations, unemployment, and insufficient income to cover all of his accrued \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloans and credit card accounts in a timely way.

(AEs A-J \nand L-M; Tr. 49-53)) \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses \nAs a young adult, Applicant was involved with several alcohol-related offenses. \nRecords document that between April 2001 and August 2002 he was arrested and \ncharged with underage drinking on four separate occasions. (GEs 2 and 8) In April and \nMay 2001, he was twice arrested and charged with underage drinking while on active \nmilitary duty. In both cases he was charged with violating Art. 92 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ. \nIn a third alcohol-related incident while on military duty, he was arrested and \ncharged with underage drinking in August 2002 under the UCMJ. (GEs 2 and 8) \nFollowing the directions of his Marine Corps commander, he attended a number of \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 43) In a separate civilian incident in March \n2002, he was civilly arrested for underage consumption or possession of alcohol and \nwas found guilty. (GEs 2 and 8) Disposition proceedings are unclear. \nBetween January 2015 and December 2018, Applicant was arrested on several \noccasions for alcohol-related offenses. Records confirm that in January 2015, he was at \nhome drinking alone. (GEs 2 and 8) He estimated to have consumed 10 to 12 beers \nbefore making the poor decision to go driving. At the time, he was still grieving over his \n2015 divorce and was using alcohol to self-medicate. (GEs 2 and 8) While driving on a \nflat tire, he was stopped by police and administered field sobriety tests. After \nadministering the tests, police arrested Applicant and transported him to a local police \nstation, where he was administered a breathalyzer. (GEs 2 and 8) Failing the \nbreathalyzer, he was arrested and charged with DuI. \nBefore a delayed court appearance on his 2015 DuI charges, Applicant was \narrested again for DUI in January 2016. (GEs 2 and 8) Prior to driving, he had \nconsumed four beers in a local night club. (GE 8) After pulling out of the parking lot, he \nwas stopped by a police car for an observed flat tire and administered field tests. (GEs 2 \nand 8) Following consultations between the two officers at the scene, he was \ntransported to a local police station and administered a breathalyzer. \nUpon appearing in court in August 2017 on his 2015 and 2016 DuI charges \n(consolidated for hearing), he pled guilty to DuI charges arising from his 2015 and 2016 \nincidents and was placed in the court\u2019s pre-trial diversion program. For both offenses. \nApplicant completed his program requirements, and both the 2015 and 2016 the \ncharges were dismissed in March 2018 on a court-approved motion of government \ncounsel.

(GEs 2 and 8) \nBacking out of his driveway, he struck his neighbor\u2019s truck and was subsequently \ntransported to a local police station for suspected DuI. After being arrested and charged \nwith DuI, the charges were dismissed in April 2018 on a court-approved motion of \ngovernment counsel (citing a remote offense). (AE Q) Applicant has had no further \nalcohol-related incidents since 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol treatment history \nConcerned about his drinking, Applicant self-referred himself to outpatient \nalcohol counseling and treatment in September 2002. (GEs 2 and 8) While details of his \ncounseling and treatment are limited, he admitted to being professionally diagnosed for \nalcohol abuse and dependence by his treatment counselors. (GE 8) \nWithout an alcohol abuse or dependence diagnosis to restrict his drinking, \nApplicant continued to consume alcohol, believing at the time that he did not have an \nalcohol problem. (GE 8) After incurring three more alcohol-related incidents between \n2015 and 2018, he came to realize that was impacting his health and finances in \nnegative ways. \nIn accordance with a DoD directive, Applicant was involuntarily referred to a \ncertified mental health provider (licensed in psychiatry) in October 2021. (GE 7) In his \nprofessional evaluation of Applicant, the licensed professional evaluator reviewed \nApplicant\u2019s medical and alcohol history before making a medical diagnosis. (GE 7) \nNoting Applicant\u2019s development history (inclusive of Applicant\u2019s 2015-2016 and 2018 \nDuIs), the evaluator entered a diagnosis of Applicant of major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent, mild, along with a generalized anxiety disorder (active). (GE 7) However, the \nevaluator made no alcohol abuse or dependence disorder. \nIn a more recent October 2023 professional outpatient evaluation of Applicant\u2019s \ngeneral mental and emotional state by a licensed, certified psychiatrist affiliated with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), evaluators diagnosed Applicant with alcohol \ndependence in remission, along with depression not otherwise specified and anxiety not \notherwise specified. (AEs K and N; Tr. 84-85) His evaluator credited him with being \nstable with medications prescribed to treat his anxiety issues and discharged him with \nno recommended follow-up counseling sessions. (AE K; Tr. 40, 85) Applicant continues \nto consume alcohol in moderation.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 12(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts. \nAdditional concerns are raised over his history of alcohol abuse and prior employment \ntermination issues associated with having an inappropriate relationship with a \nsubordinate employee during his employment with a prior employer. Security concerns \nraised under Guidelines F and G are cross-alleged as well under Guideline E. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts over an extended period warrants \nthe application of two disqualifying (DCs) under the financial considerations guideline \n(DC). DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). In \nApplicant\u2019s case, his debt delinquencies are attributable to several contributing factors: \nhis prior divorce and ensuing child support obligations, unemployment, and insufficient \nincome to timely cover all of his accrued loans and credit card accounts. \nApplicable mitigating conditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance\u201d and 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated \nand is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d \nWhile Applicant has been dilatory about monitoring and addressing her debts, \nextenuating circumstances and mitigating conditions have been major factors. Overall, \nhis debt management initiatives have been encouraging and helped him to meet his \nevidentiary burdens of demonstrating the responsible requirements of MC \u00b6 20(b) for \nmanaging his finances. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track record \nof actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance associated with the \nresponsible and good-faith payment requirements of MCs \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). \nAlcohol concerns \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple years of alcohol-\nrelated incidents spanning the years of 2001-2002 and his years of recurrent alcohol \nabuse between 2015 and 2018. Treatment admissions included both voluntary and \ninvoluntary referrals. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the strength of the evidence documented in the record, two disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(a). \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, \nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nthe frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder\u201d; and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder\u201d are all applicable to the facts of record in \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nWhile recognizing his mistakes in judgment associated with his recurrent periods \nof abusive drinking, even after receiving counseling and treatment of abusing alcohol, \nboth in 2001 and again in 2002, Applicant\u2019s abusive drinking is extenuated in \nconsiderable part by his experienced post-divorce emotional stress. With the emotional \nfallout from his 2015 divorce now behind him. he no longer feels any need to self-\nmedicate with alcohol to overcome the emotional stresses of his life. \nBased on the evidence presented, Applicant may take advantage of several \nmitigating conditions (MCs). MCs \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior \nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment\u201d; and 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.\u201d Each of these MCs apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s corrective actions taken to reduce any recurrence risks are several. \nHe has received VA counseling to address his emotional issues associated with his \n2015 divorce and unemployment difficulties, he has established a fulfilling and enduring \npersonal relationship with his fianc\u00e9, and he has received and benefitted from the \npositive counseling and treatment advice he recently received from his VA mental \nhealth counselors. With over five years of corrective actions taken by Applicant since his \nlast reported DuI in 2018, Applicant can be credited with making considerable progress \nin the management of his mental health and alcohol intake. Validation of his maintaining \nhis controlled drinking over the past five-plus years is well supported and accepted. \nRelapse risks are minimal. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns covered by Guidelines F and G are cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. Raised concerns over the state of Applicant\u2019s finances and recurrent \nalcohol-related incidents away from work are fully covered by Guidelines F and G and \ndo not require separate consideration under Guideline E. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                                   \n \n \n \n     \n \nSeparate concerns raised over 2020 termination by a prior employer due to an \ninappropriate relationship with a subordinate employee while admitted and pertinent to \nmaterial questions over his trustworthiness, reliability and willingness to follow DoD \nrules, regulations, and policies when faced with personal choices are extenuated by the \nrelative length of his relationship with the employee before he was promoted and \nsubjected to his employer\u2019s code of ethics policy with little advanced notice or time to \nextricate himself from the relationship before he received his termination notice (without \nprior warning). \nConsidering all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s isolated \nethics breach, implicit allegations of overall trust and reliability loss are unsubstantiated. \nMonths before his termination he severed his relationship with his former coworker and \nreplaced his relationship with her with his current fianc\u00e9e. Since breaking off his \nrelationship with his former coworker, Applicant has had no contact with her. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances and alcohol history are fully compatible with \nminimum standards for holding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited \ndefense contributions, his extenuating circumstances associated with his stressful \ndivorce and months of ensuing unemployment and demonstrated progress in restoring \nhis finances and alcohol intake to stable levels while addressing his underlying issues of \ndiagnosed depression and anxiety (non-specified). \nOverall, Applicant has demonstrated sufficient responsibility in regaining control \nof his finances and drinking practices to enable him to meet minimum trustworthiness, \nreliability, and good judgment requirements for holding a security clearance. See Snepp \nv. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec.

After examining the background investigation, \nthe Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication \nServices (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings necessary to issue a security \nclearance.

The DCSA \nCAS issued the SOR pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \npublicized in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, made effective in the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn June 24, 2022, Applicant provided an answer to the SOR. I was assigned \nthe case on March 24, 2023. On August 21, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing for September 22, 2023. Except for GE 4C, \nthe Government\u2019s six exhibits (GE) 1 through6 and Applicant\u2019s five exhibits (AE) A-E \nwere entered into the record without objection. The record in this case closed when the \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on October 3, 2023. \nRulings on Evidence \nThis issue arose after Applicant\u2019s termination from Company A (his former \nemployer) in January 2019 and during his DCSA CAS security clearance investigation \nwhen he was directed by the United States (U.S.) Department of Justice (DOJ) to \nrespond to a grand jury subpoena regarding business interactions with private \ncompanies and public agencies subsequent to his termination from Company A. In an \nemail dated September 20, 2023, addressed to all parties and the DOHA administrative \njudge, the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) reiterated the Department of Justice \nposition that under Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP), \nApplicant was free to testify about the existence of a grand jury subpoena (AE C, 23-\n1/22gi1891/23-2440, July 11, 2023). This email and the response by Applicant\u2019s \nattorney the same day, appears in Hearing Exhibit (HE 1). In his response, Applicant\u2019s \nattorney requested clarification from the AUSA on whether Applicant could also testify at \nthe security clearance hearing about the contents of the subpoena. At the September \n22, 2023 hearing, I decided that Applicant could only testify about the existence of the \nsubpoena. (Tr. 15) His attorney then requested that the record be kept open to permit \nadditional testimony by Applicant regarding his personal knowledge of federal agency \nA\u2019s list of contracts described in the subpoena. (Tr. 15, 167)  \nIn an email dated September 22, 2023 (after the hearing), Applicant\u2019s attorney \nreiterated his request for further clarification from the AUSA about whether Applicant \ncould testify about his personal knowledge of the contents of matters identified within \nthe grand jury subpoena. (HE 2) In an email response dated September 25, 2023 (HE \n2), the AUSA responded to the September 22, 2023 email indicating that he agreed that \nthat Rule 6(e) of the FRCP allowed Applicant to testify about: (1) the substance of his \ninterview with Agency A\u2019s investigators that occurred in June 2023 before they issued a \nsubpoena to him: (2) the types of records he turned over to the AUSA; and, (3) his \nknowledge of two Agency A contracts identified in the subpoena, including personal \nknowledge he has about contract improprieties. I have evaluated Appellant\u2019s request to \nkeep the record open in this case and the AUSA\u2019s response However, I conclude that \nthe evidence will not change my decision in this case. \n2 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSummary of Allegations and Responses \nApplicant admitted his termination from Company A (Applicant\u2019s employer from \n2008 to 2019) in January 2019 as alleged in the first sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.a. He denied \nthe second sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.a that after his termination, it was discovered by \nCompany A that he used unauthorized software on his corporate laptop, and he violated \nNon-Compete and Confidentiality Agreements. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.b alleging that he \nowes an outstanding balance of $3,300 to Company A from an advance (loan) the \ncompany disbursed to Applicant in December 2012. \nFindings of Fact \nIndividual, company, and federal agency names have been cited generically to \nprotect Applicant\u2019s privacy. The transcript and exhibits contain unredacted information \nregarding this case. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He received a community college certificate in June \n2000, and an associate degree in architectural technology in August 2009. He has been \nliving at his current address since October 2009. He earned some college credits \nbetween September 2011 and December 2012, but received no degree. He has six \nprofessional certifications and is considered a subject matter expert in the audio-visual \nfield. (GE 1 at 10-11; Tr. 136) \nApplicant married in November 2011, and has two sons. One is eight years old \nand one is six years old. His investigation and clearance record includes three public \ntrust positions in 2010, 2011, and 2017, and a current interim security clearance in May \n2018. (GE 1 at 47; Tr. 17-23, 138-139) \nApplicant has been working as a senior project manager for his current \nemployer (Company B) since January 2019. From December 2007 to January 2019, he \nwas director of Audio Visual (AV) Implementation for Company A, a defense contractor \nlocated in State X. From 2000 to November 2007, he was a computer aided design \ndrafter of drawings and blueprints. (GE 1 at 11-14) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant was terminated by Company A on January 11, 2019. \nThere are no documents that chronicle the events preceding his termination, including \nthe reasons for his termination. (Tr. 142) Rather, the first document addressing his \ntermination is dated January 14, 2019, explaining that his last date of employment was \nJanuary 11, 2019. The letter advised him not to use Company A property and not to \ninteract with company clients and partners. He was directed to return the company\u2019s \nproperty. He was advised to continue to comply with all provisions of the Non-\nDisclosure Agreement (NDA) and the Non-Compete Agreement (NCA) of Company A, \nand to disclose the terms of his NDA and NCA to his new employer.

Though the president stated that the \nreasons for the termination were explained at the meetings, those explanations do not \nappear in this email. In addition, the president explained that the termination would be \ndelayed until January 18, 2019, where Applicant and Witness 2 would each be offered \nan extra $15,000 payout in addition to their salary. Because neither Applicant nor \nWitness 2 responded to the modified offer from Company A within a designated time \nperiod, their termination became retroactive to January 11, 2019. (GE 4E) Not \nmentioned in this exhibit was a second NCA that Company also wanted Applicant to \nsign precluding him from working anywhere in the metropolitan region for a year. He did \nnot sign the second NCA. (GE 3 at 6; Tr. 142) \nThe next exhibit was a letter from Company A\u2019s law firm dated February 15, \n2019, to Applicant containing a barrage of allegations (apparently based on hearsay \nfrom an unidentified informant who may have been employed by Company A) \nconcerning violations of Company A\u2019s policies. The allegations also claim that as an \nemployee of Company B (Applicant\u2019s current employer since January 2019), he diverted \ncurrent and prospective business away from Company A in violation of his contractual \nobligations to Company A. Other allegations include Applicant\u2019s breach of his \ncontractual obligations to Company A by steering current and potential business away \nfrom Company A, and violating his position of trust by utilizing Company A\u2019s pricing \ninformation, and employing his knowledge of Company A's proprietary technical and \npricing information in violation of his contractual obligations to Company A. (GE 4F) \nGE 4F then addresses four provisions of Company A\u2019s employment, \nconfidentiality and NDA agreement which Applicant allegedly violated. Next, the exhibit \ncited various state and federal laws that were supposedly broken, as well as tortious \ninterference of contract. What is missing from the exhibit is direct evidence \nsubstantiating any violation of Applicant\u2019s obligations to Company A. Finally, Company \nA's law firm demanded that Applicant cease and desist all alleged contractual violations \nto Company A and submit an affidavit documenting actions to rectify his misconduct. \nIn his March 2019 letter to Company A\u2019s law firm (AE A), Applicant\u2019s attorney \n(who also represented Witness 2) addressed several inaccuracies in Company A\u2019s \nFebruary 2019 letter (GE 4F): (1) when Applicant joined Company B, the company was \nnot a client of Company A, and had not been for about a year; (2) though Company A\u2019s \nNDA prevents Applicant from performing work for Company B that services a former \nclient of Company A, Applicant was not performing the same work for a Company B \nclient that he had been performing for a Company A client; and, (3) when Applicant \njoined Company B, though he had provided minimal input on certain private proposal, \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompany B had already been working on that proposal before he joined Company B. \nHe never misused any Company A information regarding bids or labor rates. \nCompany A\u2019s law firm sent a second letter to Applicant dated June 7, 2019 (GE \n4H), reiterating the same allegations from GE 4F, and an additional allegation involving \nanother customer or prospective client, where Applicant allegedly violated his NCA with \nCompany A by disclosing labor category rates to Company B or other clients. However, \nas with GE 4F, there is no independent evidence in support of the company\u2019s \nallegations or the alleged adverse information discovered in a forensic analysis of \nApplicant\u2019s laptop showing installation of unauthorized software, or deliberate \ndestruction of Company A\u2019s property which purportedly breached the company\u2019s NDA \nand NCA, and applicable law. \nAfter discovering that Applicant\u2019s attorney was no longer representing him, \nCompany A\u2019s law firm sent Applicant a third letter on July 2, 2019 (GE 4I), and enclosed \na copy of the GE 4H letter. The attorney demanded that if Applicant did not respond by \nJuly 10, 2019, Company A's law firm would disclose to various government agencies \nApplicant\u2019s unsubstantiated misconduct in deleting or concealing information from his \nlaptop before he was terminated from Company A. Company A\u2019s law firm threatened \nlegal action against Applicant for breach of his contractual obligations to Company A. \n(GE 4I) \nApplicant stated in his June 2019 e-QIP, and August 2019 personal subject \ninterviews (PSIs) that Company A told him they could no longer keep him employed in \nJanuary 2019 because of a Government shutdown. (GE 1 at 13; GE 3 at 6; Tr. 140) \nApplicant signed and notarized summaries of his August 6, 2019 and August 19, 2019 \nPSIs (GE 3 at 6-8), but he did not include a date next to his signature. He certified both \nPSIs were accurate, See GE 3 at 3. In those PSIs, Applicant denied the allegations \nlodged in GE 4F, 4H, and 4I, regarding the use of unauthorized software to delete \nCompany A\u2019s data and violations Company A\u2019s NDA and Confidentiality Agreements. \nHe also noted that his attorney had responded to Company A law firm\u2019s February 2019 \nletter. (GE 4F) Applicant adopted the responses made by his attorney (who was also \nthe attorney for Witness 2) in two letters to Company A\u2019s law firm. (GE 3 at 6-8; Tr. 147-\n148 AE A; AE C)  \nIn his July 2019 follow-up letter (AE B) to the letters dated June 7, 2019 (GE \n4H), and July 2, 2019 (GE 4I), from Company A\u2019s law firm, Applicant\u2019s attorney again \nasserted that Applicant had done nothing to violate his legal obligations to Company A \nand did not possess any confidential information of Company A. His removal of \npersonal information from his laptop was chronicled in a letter which he left on top of his \nlaptop desk. After Applicant\u2019s departure, Company A\u2019s confidential and proprietary \ninformation was found to be stored in its usual location in Company A\u2019s cloud server. \nApplicant used a commercially available laptop cleaner to guard against discovery of his \npersonal information. He would have no motive to misappropriate Company A\u2019s \ninformation, and continued to deny that he pilfered the company\u2019s confidential or \nproprietary information, and Company A had no proof to the contrary.

No civil suit was filed \nagainst him. (Tr. 154-155, 168) \nWhen Applicant was hired at Company A in 2007, he had administrative access \nauthority over the laptops distributed by Company A. He maintained this access for the \nentire time he was employed by Company A. He had no formal training for the position \nexcept training on the job. He was aware that that Company A used a cloud server. In \naddition to business purposes, he used the company laptop for personal reasons like \nbanking, research, and email. He took the laptop home at various times. (Tr. 155-158, \n198-199) \nIn October or November 2018, just before Applicant was terminated in January \n2019, he deleted his personal information from the laptop using a cleaner application \nand two other applications. He needed no additional authorization to install the cleaner \napplication because of his administrative access. Also, prior to his departure from \nCompany A, he retrieved his personal articles from his desk and left his company laptop \non his desk. He deleted no data belonging to Company A from his company laptop \nbefore his departure. During his entire career, he has never been accused of \nprofessional misconduct except for Company A\u2019s accusations. (Tr. 159-166) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Applicant denied that the $25,000 bonus he received in December \n2012 was actually a loan of which he owes a $3,300 balance. At a performance \nevaluation meeting that month with the CEO and a co-owner in attendance, Applicant \nwas awarded a $25,000 bonus. He was provided with no loan agreement or contract, \nand was never asked to sign a loan agreement while at Company A. (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. \n168-169, 171) \nBetween December 2012 (when the money transfer was labeled a bonus) and \nFebruary 12, 2013 (when the CEO identified the money transfer as a loan), Applicant \nhad a discussion with the chief financial officer (CFO) of Company A who told him that \nhe would have to repay the bonus to the company. Applicant was stunned by the CFO\u2019s \nmessage because he had already used the entire $25,000 bonus to pay for a home \nrefinance. (Tr. 171-174, 184, 187) \nOn February 12 2013, Applicant informed the CEO of Company A, by email, \nthat he finally completed the closing of the refinancing of his home. He asked the CEO \nfor information on a potential monthly repayment schedule. He received an email \nresponse less than a half hour later from the CEO indicating that the loan (which was \nthe bonus he received in December 2012) would be logged into the employee \nassistance program to be dealt with later.

He felt obligated to reimburse Company A. He was not in a position to \nrepay the entire amount all at once, and he did not want create friction with Company A. \nCompany A withdrew $100 automatically from Applicant\u2019s pay check on a bi-monthly \nbasis for about six years in repayment of the loan. In September 2018, Applicant \ninformed the CFO, the CEO, and the co-owner of Company A that he would have \ndifficulty paying the $10,500 loan balance that the company wanted by the end of 2018 \nto close out the account, because his wife was having surgery and he was raising two \nyoung children on one salary. (Tr. 191-192) The last two payments, which were dated \nafter his termination on January 11, 2019, extinguished about 99% of Applicant\u2019s pay. \nBecause of the size of the last two payments totaling $5,600, he assumed that he had \ncompleted the repayment schedule of payments. (GE 2 at 3; GE 5 at 12-18; GE 6D; Tr. \n171-174, 178, 191) \nWitness 1 worked as a web designer and a systems engineer for Company A \nfrom 2012 to 2018. He did not believe that Applicant had administrative access to the \nlaptops that would permit him to install and remove software. The cleaning application \nwas a tool used to remove personal data from a Company A laptop before leaving the \ncompany. The tool also could be used to clean registry keys, or unused documents, or \ncached data. The tool was also used to improve the performance of the laptop. \nCompany A had a cloud server system to back up company data on company laptops. \nDeleting data from the laptop would not delete that information from the cloud server. \n(Tr. 28-49) \nWitness 2 was employed as an implementation manager at Company A from \nJanuary 2013 to January 2019. He is aware that the money Applicant received during \nhis employment was a bonus and not a loan. Witness 2 never saw any loan contract \nbetween Applicant and Company A. He adopted the factual responses in his attorney\u2019s \ntwo letters (the attorney representing both Witness 2 and Applicant) to Company A in \nMarch 2019 and July 2019. See AE A and AE B. Before he concluded his hearing \ntestimony, Witness 2 read the third paragraph of page four of the July 2019 letter from \nApplicant\u2019s attorney to Company A. (AE B at 4) Witness 2 agreed that Applicant \nremoved only his personal information from the laptop and Company A\u2019s confidential or \nproprietary information was left in Company A\u2019s cloud server where it always had been. \nApplicant did not take any information from Company A. (Tr. 52-89) \nWitness 3, who has held several public trust positions and clearances for \nseveral years, joined Company A as co-owner in 2004 because the CEO was not a \nUnited States citizen at the time. He left the company in 2018 over a dispute with the \nCEO. He interviewed and hired Applicant in 2008. He supervised Applicant during most \nof his employment tenure at Company A. (Tr. 91-105, 123) \nWitness 3 recalled that Applicant received several bonuses while employed at \nCompany A.

He indicated the bonus was \nnot tied to a loan agreement. He did not know that the CEO and CFO were making \nApplicant repay the bonus. (Tr. 106-111) \nIn Witness 3\u2019s opinion, Applicant never misused his laptop, or misappropriated \nCompany A\u2019s data, or installed unauthorized software. Though he was not specifically \nsure whether he talked with Applicant about Company A\u2019s NDA, based on his working \nrelationship with Applicant over the years with two different employers, Company A and \nCompany B, Witness 3 did not believe Applicant would breach Company A\u2019s NDA. (Tr. \n119-133) \nCharacter Evidence \nWhile employed at Company A from 2008 to January 2019, Applicant received \nseveral positive performance evaluations, bonuses, awards, and letters of recognition. \nHe could not retrieve most of the corroborating documents because they were in \nstorage or in his Company A email which he no longer had access to. (GE 3 at 4) \nWitnesses 1 described Applicant as an honorable and dependable person who \nwarrants a position of trust with Government. (Tr. 35, 38) Witness 2 was aware of no \ninstance when Applicant mishandled Company A\u2019s data or equipment. (Tr. 56-57) In the \ntime that he supervised Applicant, Witness 3 considered him to be an outstanding \nemployee who had never been accused of personal or professional misconduct. No one \nfrom the information technology (IT) department of Company A had advised Witness 3 \nthat Applicant was misusing the company laptop or installing unauthorized software on \nthe laptop. (Tr. 98,101-102) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concerns related to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that she may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwilling to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release \nof sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\u2026\u201d \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government has the burden of proving controverted allegations. Hence, \nexcept for the Applicant\u2019s admission that he was terminated in January 2019, the \nGovernment must establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence that the factual \nallegations in the SOR occurred and there is a rational connection between the \nestablished facts and legitimate security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-19525 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Feb, 18, 2009), (concurring and dissenting, in part)(citations omitted). See \nalso, ISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.4, 2010). \nHaving weighed all the disqualifying evidence with the favorable evidence, I \nconclude that the Government has failed to make a prima facie case by substantial \nevidence. There is no evidence to support the second sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.a. That \nportion of SOR \u00b6 1.a rests on hearsay accusations, insinuations and innuendo in \nCompany A\u2019s law firm letters, and unsupported by independent evidence from \ndocumentary or witness sources. No outside evidence was presented to support \nApplicant\u2019s alleged violations of Company A\u2019s NDA or NCA. No outside evidence was \npresented to confirm that a forensic analysis was conducted of Applicant\u2019s laptop after \nhe was terminated from employment. Lastly, Company A took no legal action against \nApplicant. In sum, the uncorroborated allegations within the second sentence of SOR \u00b6 \n1.a are not credible.  \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.b, I conclude that the $25,000 disbursed to Applicant in \nDecember 2012 was a bonus. Company A\u2019s claim that the bonus was a loan, is not \ncredible. The Government produced no documentation that confirms the money was a \nloan and not a bonus. Applicant acquiesced to Company A\u2019s change of position \nbecause he did not have the money to repay the loan in early 2013. His wife was about \nto have surgery and he was raising two young children on one salary. Of equal \nimportance to the conclusion that the money Applicant received, was a bonus and not a \nloan, is the fact that Witness 3 and the CEO of Company A presented the $25,000 \nbonus to Applicant in 2012. \nAG \u00b6 17. Since there are no disqualifying conditions applicable to the \ncircumstances of this case, it is not necessary to discuss the mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and personal conduct in the context of the nine general factors of the \nwhole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nJudging by the totality of the evidence, particularly the Government\u2019s failure to \nestablish a prima facie case in support of the SOR allegations, and the favorable \ncharacter evidence from Witnesses 1, 2, 3, and Applicant, he has overcome the security \nconcerns raised by the personal conduct guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He has never married, and has one minor child. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He was granted a security clearance in about 2018, \nand he works as a junior systems administrator for a government contractor. (Tr. 23-27; \nGE 1) \nAfter graduating college, Applicant worked in retail and was laid off when the store \nclosed in about September 2016. This caused a financial burden until he found \nemployment with a government contractor after about two months. He worked for this \nemployer for about two years before he was laid off in August 2018, when the contract \nended. He found new work two months later, with a different government contractor, in \nNovember 2018. He asserted that the 2018 period of unemployment is one of the main \nreasons for his financial problems. He stated that he did not have enough money to meet \nhis expenses, and utilized his credit cards, worked at a grocery store, and borrowed \nmoney from family during this time period. The record shows that in 2018, he only made \nabout half of his current salary. (Tr. 20-38; GE 1, 8; AE J) \nApplicant stated that in 2019, his roommate broke their lease early and absconded \nwithout paying some apartment fees and utility bills. Applicant\u2019s car was also repossessed \nthat year, which left him with greater transportation and commuting expenses. He stated \nthat he prioritized paying back family members who loaned him money after he was laid \noff. He asserted that he did not have enough funds to repay the credit cards he used while \nunemployed. (Tr. 20-38; GE 1, 8) \nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, Applicant\u2019s pregnant girlfriend \nbecame unemployed. He assisted her with her monthly expenses for about ten months. \nAfter their son was born in October 2020, he paid for their living expenses and some of \nthe costs of the baby. In about April 2021, his son started attending daycare, and \nApplicant has been paying approximately $700 monthly for it since then. Applicant also \nhad a $1500 state tax debt that he paid off with $133 monthly payments from April 2021 \nto March 2022. The tax debt is now resolved and was not alleged in the SOR.

The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f are federal student loans in collection totaling $21,876. \nApplicant attended college between 2010-2015.

(AE I) \n SOR \u00b6 1.o\nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports, bankruptcy filings, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f) are \nin \u201ccurrent\u201d status, and the lender has halted repayment pending the completion of \nlitigation of the President\u2019s loan forgiveness program. He contacted the lender to establish \na fresh start program when his finances stabilized after his bankruptcy. Applicant \nconsulted with a debt consolidation expert and a credit repair expert to resolve his \ndelinquent debts and stabilize his finances. They advised him to consult with a bankruptcy \nattorney. Applicant did so, and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy to discharge many of his debts. \nHe used legal and proper means to address his delinquent debt and get a fresh start \nfinancially. His seeking of expert and professional advice about his finances, and use of \nthe legal system to file bankruptcy are viewed as responsible behavior in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardships mainly occurred from 2018 to mid-2021, and he has \ntaken appropriate steps to resolve debts that became delinquent during this time period. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) only partially applies since he did not submit sufficient documentation to show \nthat all of his debts are paid or being resolved.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies.

He has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances by seeking expert advice, filing bankruptcy, and contacting creditors \nto resolve debts and arrange payment plans. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant has received financial counseling from legitimate and \ncredible sources, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he has undertaken good-faith efforts to \naddress his debts. Applicant is not required to show that he has paid or resolved all of his \ndebts, or that he has done so in any particular way. He has a reasonable plan to resolve \nhis debts and has implemented it. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. While Applicant appears to have a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of some of his past-due debt, he did not provide documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or of actions to resolve the issues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 41, has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, as a security officer since January 2020. He completed a security clearance application, his first, on May 6, 2020. He disclosed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in 2013 as well as outstanding federal and state income taxes. The ensuing investigation revealed additional delinquent accounts. The SOR alleges Applicant owes $41,358 on ten delinquent accounts, including outstanding federal taxes. (GE 1; Tr. 16-17) Applicant married in July 2003. Although he held steady employment from August 2003 until January 2020, his wife worked sporadically because of an ongoing medical issue. For most of their marriage, Applicant served as the primary source of income for their family, which included the couple\u2019s daughter and, at times, two of his three stepchildren. Although the couple maintains separate bank accounts, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical condition has consistently had a negative impact on their joint finances and caused them to accumulate debt. In July 2013, the couple filed for bankruptcy protection. Their debts were discharged in December 2013. He testified that within a year of the bankruptcy discharge, the couple began to experience financial problems again. (GE 1, 7; Tr. 19-22, 24, 51-53) Applicant\u2019s tax problems began around 2016.

This action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President \nEisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, \n1992, as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \na determination whether to grant his security clearance. Applicant timely answered the \nSOR and requested a hearing. \nAt the hearing, convened on June 26, 2023, I appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I, the disclosure letter, dated October 29, 2021. I admitted Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, without objection. After the \nhearing, Applicant timely submitted documents identified as AE B through AE F, which \nare admitted without objection from Department Counsel. (HE II) DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on July 7, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 41, has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, as a security \nofficer since January 2020. He completed a security clearance application, his first, on \nMay 6, 2020. He disclosed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in 2013 as well \nas outstanding federal and state income taxes. The ensuing investigation revealed \nadditional delinquent accounts. The SOR alleges Applicant owes $41,358 on ten \ndelinquent accounts, including outstanding federal taxes. (GE 1; Tr. 16-17) \nApplicant married in July 2003. Although he held steady employment from \nAugust 2003 until January 2020, his wife worked sporadically because of an ongoing \nmedical issue. For most of their marriage, Applicant served as the primary source of \nincome for their family, which included the couple\u2019s daughter and, at times, two of his \nthree stepchildren. Although the couple maintains separate bank accounts, Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s medical condition has consistently had a negative impact on their joint finances \nand caused them to accumulate debt. In July 2013, the couple filed for bankruptcy \nprotection. Their debts were discharged in December 2013. He testified that within a \nyear of the bankruptcy discharge, the couple began to experience financial problems \nagain. (GE 1, 7; Tr. 19-22, 24, 51-53) \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems began around 2016. Historically, he and his wife chose \nto file their income taxes using the married filing separately status. Prior to the 2016 tax \nyear, Applicant claimed the couple\u2019s daughter as a dependent on his income tax return. \nSince 2016, his wife has claimed their daughter as a dependent. He did not adjust the \nincome tax withholding rate from his pay to address the change, resulting in additional \nincome tax liability each year between 2016 and 2022. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges he currently \nowes $16,199 in outstanding federal taxes. He sought an installment agreement with \nthe IRS but could not afford the terms. He is not on a formal payment plan but makes ad \nhoc payments as he is able. At the time of the hearing, he had made two payments to \nthe IRS totaling $375. He claims he paid $1,349 in state taxes. He provided payment \nreceipts for two $100 payments made to the state tax authority in January 2024. (AE A, \nD; Answer; Tr. 38-44) \nApplicant denies owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g - 1.i, claiming \nthey have been paid. However, he only provided proof of payment for SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \nalso denied owing SOR \u00b6 1.c, because he believed it was included in his 2013 \nbankruptcy. However, GE 8 shows he reaffirmed the debt during his bankruptcy but did \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot follow through with the agreed upon payment plan.

He claims he established payment plans for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.j but did not provide any evidence of payments. He admits the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.f but has not taken any steps toward the resolution of those accounts. \n(AE B; Answer; Tr. 28-38) \nApplicant plans to address his outstanding debts by taking on additional jobs to \nearn more income. He began working a part-time job sometime in 2022, earning $10 \nper hour, working up to ten hours per week. At the time of the hearing, he also planned \nto start a second security job at a concert venue. He planned to work shifts on his days \noff or in the afternoon and evenings before his overnight shift at his full-time job. His \nwife is currently healthy and working. After paying their recurring expenses, Applicant \ntestified that he has over $600 in disposable income each month. (Tr. 17-18, 25-27, 46-\n50) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$41,358 in delinquent debt, including $16,199 in unpaid federal income taxes. The \nfollowing financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness or inability to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so;  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or frequently filing annual Federal, state, local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.   \nThe following mitigating condition partially applies: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not the result of reckless or irresponsible \nbehavior, but events beyond his control - the financial impact of his wife\u2019s medical \nissues, her inability to work consistently, and insufficient income to support his family. \nHe is acting responsibly by taking on additional employment to generate additional \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nincome. However, he has not provided a sufficient track record of debt repayment to \nmitigate the underlying security concerns. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)). Although, an applicant is not expected to have \nresolved all the alleged debts in advance of the hearing, he is responsible for providing \nsufficient evidence to explain, refute, or rebut the SOR allegations. Applicant did not, \nfailing to meet his burdens of production and persuasion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 41, has worked as a pipefitter on the same federal contract since approximately 2007. During his tenure on the contract, he has worked for several federal contracting companies. He was initially granted access to classified information in 2004. He completed security clearance applications on September 3, 2009 (GE 3); December 20, 2011 (GE 2); and most recently on August 8, 2020 (GE 1). On the 2020 application, he disclosed a January 2018 arrest for second degree assault. The ensuing investigation uncovered a history of marijuana use as well as potential misuse of Percocet and Suboxone. Applicant\u2019s history of drug use and alleged misuse of prescription drugs was not disclosed on the 2009 and 2011 clearance applications. (TR2 at 54,64; GE 1-5) Criminal Conduct The single allegation of criminal conduct, SOR \u00b6 2.a, arose from an incident between Applicant and his ex-wife. Sometime in 2018, the two had an altercation, which Applicant claims was about her extra-marital affairs. He claims that she attacked him first. He fell, inadvertently hitting his head against hers in the process. Applicant claims that she did not file charges until they were in the midst of their divorce proceedings in 2019. He was charged with first degree assault, second degree assault, and false imprisonment. In November 2019, he pleaded guilty to second degree assault, received probation before judgment, and was fined $257.50. He completed a court-ordered domestic violence class ",

During his tenure on the contract, he has worked for several \nfederal contracting companies. He was initially granted access to classified information \nin 2004. He completed security clearance applications on September 3, 2009 (GE 3); \nDecember 20, 2011 (GE 2); and most recently on August 8, 2020 (GE 1). On the 2020 \napplication, he disclosed a January 2018 arrest for second degree assault. The ensuing \ninvestigation uncovered a history of marijuana use as well as potential misuse of \nPercocet and Suboxone. Applicant\u2019s history of drug use and alleged misuse of \nprescription drugs was not disclosed on the 2009 and 2011 clearance applications. \n(TR2 at 54,64; GE 1-5) \nCriminal Conduct \nThe single allegation of criminal conduct, SOR \u00b6 2.a, arose from an incident \nbetween Applicant and his ex-wife. Sometime in 2018, the two had an altercation, which \nApplicant claims was about her extra-marital affairs. He claims that she attacked him \nfirst. He fell, inadvertently hitting his head against hers in the process. Applicant claims \nthat she did not file charges until they were in the midst of their divorce proceedings in \n2019. He was charged with first degree assault, second degree assault, and false \nimprisonment. In November 2019, he pleaded guilty to second degree assault, received \nprobation before judgment, and was fined $257.50. He completed a court-ordered \ndomestic violence class in November 2020, and participated in biweekly therapy \nsessions between December 2019 as January 2020. Applicant and his wife were \ndivorced as of 2021. They co-parent their minor two children without incident. Applicant \nhas no other incidents of criminal conduct in his record. (TR2 at 52-53,55-58,98-105; \nGE 5, AE D-H) \nPrescription Drug Use \nIn 2001, Applicant suffered a workplace injury. His doctor prescribed him \nPercocet. He was prescribed up to 2 pills per day of an unknown dosage. At times, he \nfelt that prescribed amount was not enough to relieve his pain, so he would take up to \nfour pills per day. If he ran out of pills, he did not try to obtain additional pills through \nillegal means. He continued to use the Percocet in this manner until 2007, when he felt \nthat his reliance on the drug was problematic. On his own, he sought treatment from a \npsychiatrist in November 2007 who prescribed Suboxone, a treatment approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration for opioid use disorder. His treatment also included \nindividual and group therapy. (TR2 at 59-63,83; GE 4) \nDuring his May 2021 interview with a background investigator, Applicant revealed \nhis use of Suboxone. When asked if he had ever misused a prescription drug, even if it \nhas been prescribed to him, Applicant responded that he had.

Subject was confronted why he \ntakes 2 Suboxone pills if he is only prescribed 1.5 Subject answered that \nhe\u2019d either take an additional half if he still feels pain that day and/or to \nmake up for not taking the additional half that he\u2019s prescribed to make up \nfor his prescription doses. (GE 4) \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s testimony about use of Percocet was largely \nconsistent with his statements in the subject interview. However, he offered clarification \non his use of Suboxone. Applicant explained that he was not prescribed pills, but sheets \nof lingual films. Initially, he was prescribed 2 films, which was reduced to 1.5 films. To \nachieve this dose, he would cut one of the films in half, but he stated this would ruin the \nremaining film and he would sometimes just take 1 film instead of the prescribed 1.5. He \nwould not take more than the 1.5 film dosage because he was not trying to increase, but \nrather decrease the dosage. He did not think that taking less than prescribed was \nconsidered misuse of a prescription drug. (TR2 at 75-92) \nRegarding his past use of Percocet, Applicant stated in the 2021 subject \ninterview: \nSubject was asked to explain his past Percocet use. Subject was initially \nprescribed Percocet in 2001 (unknown prescription amount). \u2026 Subject \nwas prescribed to take 1-2 Percocet 7 days a week, but the pain did not \ngo away. Subject began self-medicating with Percocet, taking up to 4 pills \nper day. Subject was asked if each time he ran out of Percocet earlier or \nbefore the expected refill date, was he denied a refill from either doctors or \nthe pharmacy, Subject replied no.

He obtained a medical \nmarijuana card from his state\u2019s issuing authority, giving him the ability to legally \npurchase the drug from state-run dispensaries. He used the drug through vaporizer \ncartridges in the evening before bed. He did not use the drug before reporting to work. \nThough he was vaguely aware that he could not use marijuana while having a \nclearance, he believed that once the drug was legally prescribed to him by a physician \nthat the use was permissible. He stopped using the drug after he received the initial \nnotice of hearing from DOHA in May 2023, when he perceived his use of the drug to be \nan issue with his security clearance. (TR2 58-59, 64-72) \nSecurity Clearance Application Disclosures \nThe circumstances under which Applicant completed his 2011 security clearance \napplication are not clear from the record. It is unknown if he completed the application \non his own or with the help of a third party. In response to questions whether he illegally \nused controlled substances, narcotics, stimulants, depressants, steroids, inhalants, or \nprescription drug in the last seven years and whether he intentionally engaged in the \nmisuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed for \nhim, Applicant he answered \u2018no.\u2019 The allegation, SOR \u00b6 3.c, is based on the statements \nApplicant made during his May 2021 subject interview as indicated on page 5, supra. \n(GE 1, GE 4) \nWhen Applicant completed his August 2020 security clearance application, he \ndid so with the help of the coworker who assisted him at the hearing. She is the account \nadministrator on the contract on which Applicant works. She handles the human \nresources paperwork and any administrative needs the contract requires. She testified \non his behalf. She and Applicant have worked together for 13 years and are friends. \nShe explained that Applicant often comes to her when he encounters things at work that \nhe does not understand. She explained that he understands his obligation to follow \nsecurity protocols and did not have any concerns about his ability to follow them. (TR2 \nat 35-37,40-41) \nTo complete the August 2020 application, Applicant\u2019s coworker would read the \nquestions to Applicant, who would then verbally answer. She would enter Applicant\u2019s \nanswer into the electronic application. When she asked Applicant the following \nquestions comprising Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity, he verbally \nanswered that he had not illegally used drugs or controlled substances in the past \nseven years, or illegally used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s coworker entered \u201cNo\u201d into the application. She was aware of \nhis marijuana use. He told her about his use of medical marijuana during his divorce in \n2019. She has seen his medical marijuana card. Because he used marijuana as \nallowed with a state-issued marijuana card, neither Applicant nor his coworker believed \nthat his use could be considered illegal and required a \u2018yes\u2019 answer to the questions in \nSection 23.

He explained to her that he didn\u2019t always take his prescriptions as \nordered, sometimes taking less than his prescribed based on how he was feeling. (TR2 \nat 48-50) \nAt the hearing, Applicant disclosed that he had reading comprehension issues. \nHe explained that while he could read, he did not read on the level expected of a high \nschool graduate. He also explained that when he did read documents, he did not always \ncomprehend the substance of the material. (TR2 at 35,37, 40-41) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges misconduct under the drug involvement and substance misuse, \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct guidelines. While the government had a good-\nfaith basis for each of the allegations, the behavior alleged under the drug involvement \nand substance misuse and personal conduct guidelines does not rise to the level of a \nsecurity concern. The allegations under these guidelines are resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor as explained below. However, the record supports a prima facie case under the \ncriminal conduct guideline, but the alleged conduct is mitigated as explained below. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \ndrugs and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because \nsuch behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). \nThe SOR alleges a history of prescription drug misuse, specifically Percocet \nbetween and 2001 and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and Suboxone from 2007 to present (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). These allegations warrant consideration under disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(a), \n\u201cany substance misuse.\u201d \nMore than 18 years ago, Applicant sought treatment for what he believed was a \nproblematic reliance on Percocet. He came to this realization on his own and not as the \nresult of adverse legal or employment action. He has been under medical care for the \nissue since 2007. According to his treating physician, Applicant has been in compliance \nwith his treatment plan without incident or concern. The record does not contain any \nevidence of a current substance abuse concern. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also admitted to taking his prescription for Percocet and Suboxone as \nother than directed. However, applying the disqualifying condition to any admitted \nincident of taking a prescription in a manner other than directed does not equate to \nsubstance misuse as intended under the Directive. Circumstances matter. The guideline \ndefines the term \u2018substance misuse\u2019 as the \u201cgeneric term adopted in the guideline to \ndescribe any of the behaviors described in the guideline (e.g., to cause physical or \nmental impairment or a manner inconsistent with its intended use). \nThe evidence does not establish if the alleged misuse was a routine behavior. He \nused the prescription drugs for pain management, not to impair his physical or mental \nstate. There is no evidence that Applicant engaged in drug seeking or other behavior to \nobtain additional quantities of his prescription drugs in a manner that suggested abuse \nor dependence. There is no evidence that his use of the prescription drugs caused him \nto engage in legal or professional misconduct. While Applicant may not have followed \nhis perception orders precisely, there is no evidence of substance misuse as \ncontemplated under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant used marijuana from December 2019 until \nat least May 2021, while possessing a DOD security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he \nstated his intent to continue using the drug in the future (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The allegations \nmust be considered the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation  or holding a sensitive position; and, \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement ad substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse.  \nThe Appeal Board has held that the application of AG \u00b6 25 (a) has two distinct \nparts that must be met: that the applicant has engaged in illegal drug use, and that the \napplicant has access to classified information or holds a sensitive position. (ISCR 22-\n02623 (App. Bd. Jan 24, 2024) There is no dispute that Applicant used marijuana while \ngranted access to classified information. The issue of whether or not his use of \nmarijuana is illegal, is not as clear. While marijuana remains classified as an illegal drug \nunder federal law, the drug is legalized for medical use in his state of residence. He \nlegally obtained a state-issued medical marijuana license and purchased the drug from \nstate-sanctioned dispensaries. He did not know that he was acting in violation of federal \nlaw or intentionally engaging in misconduct that raised a security concern. His \nstatements regarding his intent to continue using the drug were based on his belief that \nhis behavior was legal. He is not held to a higher standard because he is a long-time \nclearance holder. The Appeal Board has held: \nApplicants cannot be expected to be constitutional law experts or versed \nin the concept of Federal supremacy. The ambiguity between state and \nFederal drug laws and the ensuing confusion was addressed by the \nSecurity Executive Agent in December 2021 in \u201cClarifying Guidance \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons \nProposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position\u201d (SecEA Clarifying Guidance). Relevant to the \ntopic of notice, the Guidance encourages employers \u201cto advise \nprospective national security workforce employees that they should refrain \nfrom any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security \nvetting process, which commences once the individual signs the \ncertification contained in the [SCA].\u201d SecEA Guidance at 2. Implicit in this \nguidance is the recognition that the SCA itself no longer puts applicants on \nnotice and that employers should affirmatively be providing notice to \nprospective employees. The SecEA\u2019s guidance to employers, however, \ncannot be presumed to have been followed. (ISCR Case No. 22-02132 \nApp. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received any advice from his employer about \nthe use of marijuana even when done so legally in the employee\u2019s state of residence. \nWhile the completion of the 2020 security clearance application was not sufficient to \nalert Applicant to the potential security concern raised by his use of marijuana, he made \nthe realization on his own in May 2023 and ceased using before the hearing in this \ncase. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b are also resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process. (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified his December 2011 and \nAugust 2020 security clearance applications by failing to disclose the extent of his \nhistory of illegal drug use and prescription drug misuse while having a security \nclearance. The absence of information alone is not enough to establish an intentional \nfalsification. The record must also contain direct or circumstantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s intention to mislead the Government. \nSpecifically, the SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his \nmisuse of Percocet and Suboxone on his December 2011 application (SOR \u00b6 3.a), and \nhis misuse of Suboxone on the August 2020 application (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c). The record does \nnot have sufficient evidence to establish the underlying conduct. The record contains \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s admissions of occasional prescription misuse at unspecified \ntimes. There is no evidence to support a finding that Applicant misused any prescription \ndrug during the required 2004 to 2011 reporting period for the 2011 application or the \n2013 to 2020 reporting period for the August 2020 application. Even if Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are deemed sufficient evidence of his prescription misuse during the \nrequired reporting periods, there is no evidence in the record of his intent to deceive or \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmislead the Government. The record does not contain statements contemporaneous to \nthe 2011 application about his use of prescription drugs that could elucidate his intent at \nthe time he completed the security clearance application. Neither the May 2021 \nbackground interview, nor any of Applicant statements during this adjudication provide \nevidence of his to intentionally falsify either his 2011 or 2020 security clearance \napplications. \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to disclose his marijuana use between \n2019 and August 2020 (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and that he used the drug while holding a security \nclearance. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) He did not know that he engaged in illegal behavior under \nFederal law because he used the drug legally under the marijuana laws of his state of \nresidence. Applicant also did not believe that his legal use of marijuana violated his \nduties or responsibilities as a clearance holder. While Applicant\u2019s assumptions were \nwrong on both counts, his mistaken belief about the legality of his behavior does not rise \nto the level of intentional falsification. The Appeal Board has determined that despite the \ninstruction preceding the Section 23 questions about illegal drug use: \n[T]he SCA does not inform an applicant that marijuana remains illegal \nunder Federal law. Depending on the facts of a given case, it is \nforeseeable that some applicants might believe that their state-authorized \nuse of marijuana is legal, and erroneously check \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cillegal use.\u201d The \nsecurity significance of that answer in terms of a falsification under \nGuideline E would be defined by the specific circumstances. Regardless \nof a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answer, whether or not this question puts applicant on \nnotice that continued use of state-legal marijuana is incompatible with \nbeing granted eligibility for access to classified information is a separate \nmatter. Given the dichotomy between state and Federal laws, some \napplicants may continue to use marijuana products after completing the \nquestionnaire\u2014not in reckless disregard of security clearance standards \nbut in ignorance of Federal law. In the subsequent interview, the \nbackground investigator may\u2014or may not\u2014clarify the Federal position \nand put an applicant on notice that such use is Federally illegal and \nincompatible with holding a clearance. (ISCR Case No. 22-02132 App. Bd. \nOct. 27, 2023) \nApplicant did not intentionally use marijuana in violation of Federal law or his \nresponsibilities as a clearance holder. He did not intend to conceal his behavior. The \ncoworker who helped him complete the 2020 application was also aware of Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use before they completed the application. The coworker also had no reason \nto believe that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana required reporting on the security clearance \napplication. Under these circumstance, Applicant\u2019s failure to report based on his and his \ncoworker\u2019s misunderstanding of federal law does not constitute an intent to deceive the \nGovernment.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. In November 2019, Applicant was arrested \nfor and convicted of, second degree assault and sentenced to probation before \njudgment. The following disqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time, without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction occurred five years ago. He has been released \nfrom court supervision for over three years. Although serious, the arrest occurred during \nhis contentious divorce. He completed his court-ordered counseling. He does not have \na history of violent behavior or other criminal conduct. He and his ex-wife have \ndeveloped a more cordial parenting relationship. It is unlikely that Applicant will engage \nin similar behavior in the future. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(d). Having had the opportunity to interact and observe Applicant in a \nMicrosoft TEAMS setting and at an in-person hearing, his reading comprehension and \nlanguage processing issues were apparent. I believe he provided answers to the \nquestions of the 2011 and 2020 security clearance applications and provided \ndisclosures during the recent adjudication to the best of his abilities. His \nmisunderstanding of prohibition against marijuana use by individuals having a security \nclearance was genuine. However, he is sufficiently self-aware to seek help and \nclarification when he does not understand something to ensure he does not violate any \nrules or regulations. He has demonstrated that once issues are clarified for him, he will \nadjust his behavior accordingly. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

He had a few beers at \nsomeone\u2019s home. He left his car there while they all went out to bars in a nearby city. At \nthe end of the evening, Applicant retrieved his car and began to drive home, believing he \nwas sober enough to do so. However, on the way home, he also stopped for coffee so he \ncould sober up. He sat in his car in the coffee shop parking lot for 45 minutes. A nearby \nsecurity guard thought he was acting suspiciously and called police. The officer saw him \nmove his car out of a \u201cno parking\u201d fire zone. Applicant told the officer he had been drinking. \nHe was arrested and charged with DUI after failing roadside sobriety tests. Breathalyzers \nat the police station revealed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.17%. He was jailed \novernight. He reported the incident to his employer\u2019s security office days later and kept \nthem informed. (AE A) (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nA month later, in October 2005, Applicant attended a concert in another city in \nState 1, where he lived. He then went to a bar and consumed four alcoholic beverages in \nfour hours. He again attempted to drive home, and soon realized it was unsafe to do so, \nin part because it was rainy. He pulled over on the highway and was walking to a nearby \nconvenience store to call a taxi when police arrived, having seen his parked car on the \nroadside. He acknowledged he had been driving the car, failed the sobriety tests, blew a \n0.15% BAC on the breathalyzer, and was arrested for DUI. (AE A) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s 2005 DUIs were adjudicated together and he was found guilty \non both charges, in about September 2006. His license was suspended for two years, he \nwas ordered to attend 48 hours of alcohol education classes and to perform 30 hours of \ncommunity service. He was also fined and ordered to pay court costs. He attended one \nrequired Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) class. He completed all requirements. He reported \nboth arrests to security. (AE A, Att. 6-7; Tr. 114-117, 124) \nApplicant had no other alcohol-related incidents or offenses for the next 10 years. \nDuring this period, He admitted that he drank too much on weekends, but he denied any \ndriving after consuming alcohol. During this period, he met and began dating his wife. (AE \nA; Tr. 117) \nIn April 2015, Applicant and his wife, then his fianc\u00e9e, were living and working in \nState 2. He went to a neighborhood bar with friends. He consumed three or four beers \nduring the evening. While paying his bar tab at the end of the evening, he was approached \nby another bar patron, who confronted him and demanded that he leave the bar \nimmediately. After paying his tab. Applicant left the bar and saw the other patron talking \nto a uniformed police officer. Applicant was then arrested and taken to a local police \nstation. He spent the night in jail. He only learned later that he was charged with public \nintoxication. When he went court two months later, the arresting officer failed to appear, \nand the charge was dismissed. He reported the offense on his next SCA, completed in \nJuly 2018. He testified that he was embarrassed and regretful about the incident and he \nwas not proud of it, particularly because it occurred a month before his wedding.

(AE A) He stopped drinking hard alcohol and would mostly drink wine \nwith his wife. He acknowledged uncomfortable conversations with his wife about his \ndrinking, including whether he should stop. As his wife testified, he acknowledged drinking \nwine after she went to bed -- \u201cone or two at least.\u201d He acknowledged drinking a bottle of \nwine on the weekends.

He consumed several glasses of wine, without food or \nwater, between about 3 PM and 8 PM. He was pulled over for speeding. He failed \nroadside sobriety tests and a breathalyzer registered a 0.238% BAC. He was arrested \nand charged with DUI. (GE 1.

(GE 4 at 17-18; AE A, Att. 11, \nAtt. 12; Tr. 127) (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nDocumentation reflects that, on intake at Treatment Center B, Applicant was \nregarded as cooperative and well-spoken but he also minimized and disregarded the \nconsequences of his drinking and appeared to justify his conduct. He presented for \ntreatment after his third DUI and recognized the consequences facing him (losing his job, \nlosing his license, and going to jail). (GE 4 at 1) He reported that he drove while \nintoxicated, cared for his children while under the influence, and had driven with them \nwhile under the influence. In his hearing testimony, he acknowledged that there were \nprobably other times when he drove while \u201cover the limit\u201d but denied driving under the \ninfluence with his children. (Tr. 128-129,154, 173-174) He reported blackouts, loss of \nrecollection, missing work, and showing up to work hung over. He explained in testimony \nthat he was sometimes late to work because he did not have a driver\u2019s license but denied \nany other alcohol-related work issues. He denied blackouts. (Tr. 127-128, 149-150, 155) \nHe noted a family history of alcohol abuse and recognized his disregard for his own well- \nbeing and the damage alcohol was doing to his health. (GE 4 at 5) He reported beginning \ndrinking in his teens with no significant periods of sobriety. He reported consuming two \nbottles of wine over the previous 19 days.

He was \nsentenced to one year of supervised probation. He was also ordered to complete \ncommunity service, attend a DUI education class, substance abuse treatment, and a \nvictim awareness course. He was fined and ordered to pay court costs. His probation was \nterminated several months early (and successfully), in July 2021. He also said he was not \nallowed to drive. By then, his office was working remotely due to the pandemic. (GE 1, \nGE 2, GE 3; AE A, Att. 9, Att. 10; Tr. 167-168, 172-173) \nAs recommended, Applicant continued meeting with the Treatment Center B\u2019s \n\u201calumni\u201d group, both locally and virtually, from about April 2020 to April 2021. (Tr. 162-\n164) He also immediately joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He attended 90 AA \nsessions in 90 days. He then attended three to five meetings a week for the next 18-24 \nmonths (either in-person or online, due to COVID pandemic restrictions). He has had an \nAA sponsor ever since, including his current sponsor, Mr. X (discussed below), and others \nbefore him. He now attends between one and three AA meetings a week. He gets \nsignificant value from the experiences of his sponsors. (AE A, Att. 13; Tr. 133-135, 137-\n143, 164-166) He acknowledged that his daily AA meetings often put a strain on his wife, \nsince the meetings were often in the evenings, as she was coming home from work. (Tr. \n156-157) \nApplicant has not consumed any alcohol since March 14, 2020, more than three \nyears and seven months before his October 2023 DOHA hearing.

(Tr. 159) He has also pursued a healthier lifestyle, including \nexercise, gardening, outdoor nature hobbies, and spending time with his wife and young \nsons. (Tr. 143-145) He acknowledged that he came to the realization that he had to \nchange his life. \u201cBeing an alcoholic, alcohol was like a second job;\u201d hiding how much he \ndrank and arguing with his wife or family about his drinking. He does not do that anymore. \nHe prefers to spend time with his family. (Tr. 158-159) Applicant is very confident about \nhis ability to maintain sobriety going forward. He loves his job and the role he plays \nsupporting national defense. (Tr. 146-147) \nAt the time of his hearing, Applicant had not had a subsequent or updated \nassessment or diagnoses since his diagnosis of severe alcohol abuse disorder at \nTreatment Center B in 2020.

He has had a driver\u2019s license without restrictions for about two years. (Tr. 166) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is an 18-year cleared employee at Company A. She holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and dual master\u2019s degrees. They met through work in about 2008, \nbegan dating in 2011, moved to State 2 together for work in 2013, and married in 2015. \nThey have three boys all under age six, including a toddler. (Tr. 42-46, 87-88) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is not a big drinker. He drank but not more than others did. He \nbecame more family oriented after the birth of their first child. Beginning in about 2017-\n2018, she became more concerned about his drinking. This was a hard time in their \nmarriage. She loves him and does not want him to hurt himself but he said at the time \nthat he did not want to be controlled. Incidents where he drank too much were sporadic \nand often months apart. They had conversations about his drinking level but little changed \nduring this period. (Tr. 42-52) \nAfter their children were born (2017-2018), Applicant\u2019s drinking pattern would be \nto drink at home, since they did not go out much. She believes he would drink after she \nwent to bed. He would drink wine with dinner and would drink on weekends. She is not \naware that he ever went to work late or missed work. He never drove with their children \nafter consuming alcohol. Drinking was social and to relieve stress. (Tr. 72-82) \nAfter Applicant was arrested in March 2020, his wife was upset. His parents and \nher mother came immediately to help. The family talked and decided that Applicant \nneeded to get help. They researched rehabilitation facilities and he left for inpatient rehab \nalmost immediately. Previously, Applicant had resisted seeking treatment and was initially \nresistant again due to his family and work responsibilities but agreed to enter treatment \nvoluntarily. His manager was very supportive. (Tr. 52-60 and 77-78) \nApplicant\u2019s wife said the family had little contact with him while he was in inpatient \ntreatment, only a few calls. When he came home, he had changed and become more \nreserved, rather than being \u201chappy-go-lucky\u201d as before. After several more months he \nbegan to see life without drinking. It took a year for his wife to feel comfortable having a \ndrink with dinner. She wanted to be supportive of his sobriety. She now feels they have \ndeveloped confidence and trust that he will not drink and she does not think about him \n\u201cfalling off the wagon.\u201d She said he treated his sobriety as his number one priority because \n\u201cif I don\u2019t do this, everything falls apart.\u201d They did couples counseling as part of Applicant\u2019s \nafter-care program, for six to nine months as recommended and some individual \ncounseling. He has been actively involved in AA and is working with his sponsor. He now \nhas new hobbies and pastimes, like gardening. He has maintained sobriety since March \n2020.

He is a very good father and husband. He is actively involved with \ntheir children. Their marriage and children mean a lot to him. He has tried \u201creally, really, \nhard\u201d working on rehabilitation and sobriety. He is proud of his work and his support of \nthe country. (Tr. 83-87) Applicant\u2019s parents also provided strong recommendation letters \nfor their son, which I read and closely considered. (AE A, Att. 17, 18) \nMr. X, Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor is also a cleared employee in the field of aviation. \nHe has been a member of AA for almost 40 years. They met through AA about two years \nago and he agreed to become his sponsor a few months later. They see each other at \nweekly AA meetings, speak by phone between meetings about once a week, and meet \noccasionally for lunch. Mr. X attested that Applicant is doing well in AA, and that his AA \nparticipation and efforts at rehabilitation are \u201con par\u201d with someone maintaining \ncontinuous sobriety: \u201cIf he keeps doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019ll keep getting what he\u2019s \ngetting.\u201d Mr. X has seen no concerning behavior suggesting relapse. Applicant has not \nexpressed any urges to drink, and Mr. X has not known him to have done so. Applicant \nis on Step 8 of the 12 AA recovery steps (willingness to make amends). (Tr. 24-40) \nSeveral other participants from AA and Treatment Center B provided similar, strong \nrecommendation letters, which I read and closely reviewed. (AE A, Att. 14, 15, 16, 19) \nApplicant\u2019s character witness, Ms. F, is a veteran and longtime employee of the \naerospace and defense industry. She graduated from a service academy, was \ncommissioned as an active-duty military intelligence officer for several years, earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree, and joined the defense industry in 2001. She is currently a vice \npresident. She has held a clearance for many years. (Tr. (91-93) \nMs. F. was Applicant\u2019s supervisor for about three and a half years, from 2019 to\nmid-2023 when she left the company. They generally had very close and continuing \nprofessional contact, though it diminished during the COVID pandemic due to remote \nworking (which, by coincidence, began right after Applicant\u2019s March 2020 DUI). (Tr. 93-\n94, 97-98, 101-104) She testified that Applicant was an extremely reliable employee and \na creative and strategic thinker, a leader and a subject matter expert. (Tr. 93-95) \n \nApplicant informed Ms. F of his 2020 DUI within days afterward and that he was \nentering alcohol rehabilitation. Before then, she had no concerns about his work \nperformance, judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, or clearance eligibility and she has no \nsuch concerns now. (Tr. 95-96, 99-104) She credits him with disclosing the matter, taking \nit seriously, and taking concrete steps to change his behavior.

This included \u201ccollateral\u201d evidence \nsuch as professional recommendations by peers and supervisors, evaluation of job \nperformance, evaluation of his support system, 12-step program attendance, \naccountability check-ins with a sponsor and other factors.

(AE B) \nPolicies \nNo one has a right to a security clearance. As the Supreme Court held in \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) or alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI twice in the fall of 2005 and again in March 2020. \nHe was arrested for public intoxication in 2015. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. His habitual \nconsumption of alcohol, to the point of impaired judgment, satisfies AG \u00b6 22(c). Applicant \nwas diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder in March 2020. AG \u00b6 22(d) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant incurred two DUI charges in 2005, in the aftermath of a breakup. He was \narrested for public intoxication while outside a bar in 2015, though the case was \ndismissed. His drinking continued during the early years of his marriage and, as his wife \ntestified and as he acknowledged, it became problematic and caused strain in the \nmarriage as they began raising a young family. Matters culminated in March 2020, when \nhe was arrested and charged with a third DUI, with a 0.238 BAC, while coming home from \na happy hour. \nAs Applicant acknowledges, it took this third DUI for him to seriously address his \nalcohol issues through treatment and counseling. He completed impatient and outpatient \ntreatment in the weeks that followed. He then pursued AA, participating daily for 90 days, \nand several times a week in the years since then. He engaged in couples counseling with \nhis wife. He completed probation successfully and it was terminated early. He maintains \nactive, ongoing participation in AA, with a very experienced sponsor who testified credibly \nabout Applicant\u2019s participation and appropriate progress in AA and his sobriety since \nMarch 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s severe alcohol use disorder is now in sustained remission and he has \na fair prognosis, as demonstrated by AE B. He has abstained from alcohol use entirely \nsince his March 2020 DUI and intends to continue doing so. He has a strong, active \nsupport network in his wife and family, his AA network and his network of Treatment B \n\u201calumni.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 DUI was not isolated or due to unusual circumstances, as he had \ntwo earlier, similar DUI offenses almost 20 years ago, and another public intoxication \ncharge in 2015. While it cannot be said that there is no risk of relapse, Applicant is doing \neverything he can to address his alcohol problem responsibly. And he has established a \ndocumented track record of abstinence and sobriety, without any evidence of relapse in \nthe more than three and a half years since his 2020 DUI. \nApplicant has also found new hobbies and pastimes and is a dedicated father and \nhusband. He has a long, established, excellent work record. He credibly attested that with \nhis record, he needs to continue with his AA counseling and to utilize his support networks \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto continue to maintain sobriety (as Mr. M concluded and recommended in the post-\nhearing evaluation). \nIn addition to his own testimony, which I found credible, Applicant also presented \nstrong, very credible whole-person testimony from his wife, his supervisor, and his AA \nsponsor that support his case in mitigation. Applicant has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of abstinence and changed behavior, with a support network in place \nto guard against future relapses. Applicant has provided sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe alcohol-related security issues under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), 23(c), and 23(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline G in my \nwhole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the alcohol involvement and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for continued access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

The background \ninvestigation discovered additional drug-related criminal conduct dating back to 1988. \n(GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history dates to high school. He began using the drug his \nsophomore year in high school. At some point, he began selling marijuana cigarettes. In \nJanuary 1984, during his senior year of high school, school officials found marijuana in \nhis locker.

(GE 6; Tr. 81-83) \nHe attended college in State 1, between August 1984 and May 1989, earning a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in physics. During college, he used marijuana recreationally with \nfriends. He was arrested in May 1988 in State 2, where he traveled with a group of \nfriends to go to a party or nightclub. The group left the event, intending to smoke \nmarijuana in the car they used to travel to State 2. Applicant did not own the car and he \nwas not the driver. A police officer observed them in the car and approached the \nvehicle. Upon doing so, the officer noticed an open container of alcohol.

He appeared, as required, represented by counsel. He \nwas found not guilty. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr. 84-85) \nAfter graduating from college in May 1989, he accepted a job in his hometown \nand lived with a roommate. Though he does not remember the circumstances, he was \narrested after police came to his home and while there found marijuana on the \npremises. Applicant maintains that the marijuana did not belong to him. He was arrested \nfor possession of marijuana in September 1989. The charges were dismissed. (Tr. 87-\n88) \nShortly after the September 1989 event, Applicant began selling drugs. Although \nhe was working, he did not feel that he was earning enough money. At first, he sold \nmarijuana. Sometime in 1991, he began selling cocaine. In August 1991, he was \narrested for possession with intent to distribute cocaine after a buyer, who was working \nwith the police, set up a transaction that ended in Applicant\u2019s arrest. (Tr. 91-96) \nWhile pending trial on that matter, he continued to sell cocaine and was arrested \nagain in May 1993. A police officer attempted a traffic stop on the car Applicant was \ndriving. Instead of pulling over, he led the police on a brief chase, throwing the cocaine \nout of the window as he drove. Ultimately, he decided to pull over. He was charged with \nmisdemeanors for prohibited offensive weapons, reckless endangerments, and violating \nthe controlled substance, drug device, and cosmetic act. The charges were \nconsolidated with those from the August 1991 arrest. He pleaded guilty to one felony \nand one misdemeanor count of violating State 1\u2019s controlled substances act and was \nsentenced to 18 to 36 months incarceration. Initially, he served his time in a halfway \nhouse, but after violating curfew, he was transferred to a state penitentiary to serve the \nremainder of his sentence. He was released in August 1996, and ordered to serve five \nyears supervised parole. The court granted him early release after determining that \nApplicant\u2019s life was headed in a positive direction. He had enrolled in a graduate degree \nprogram and started working a job in his field that required travel. (GE 4, 6; Tr. 96-100) \nAfter he was released from parole, he resumed using marijuana. He used the \ndrug once or twice per week. He stopped using when his wife got pregnant in 1998. \nDespite his 1993 felony conviction, Applicant obtained a security clearance from \nanother government agency in March 2009. During his 2009 background investigation, \nhe discussed his history of drug use and drug-related criminal history in two subject \ninterviews in August and October of 2009. In the October 2009 interview, he stated that \nhe had no intention of using marijuana in the future. He claims he did not use marijuana \nwhile he had an active security clearance. (GE 1, 6) \nHe abstained from marijuana use until 2013, when he resumed use to help with \nthe nausea, he experienced on deep sea fishing trips. At first, he used Dramamine to \naddress the nausea. While it helped, it upset his stomach. A friend recommended \nmarijuana to help with the issue. He did not consult his physician for another legally \navailable remedy. He would either smoke the drug or consume edibles on each trip \nwhich he took at least three times per year.

During the traffic stop, the police officer smelled \nmarijuana in the car. Applicant admitted to the officer that there was marijuana in the \ncenter console. He consented to a search of the vehicle, during which the officer found \na gun in the driver\u2019s side door pocket. Because of his status as a convicted felon, he is \nunable to possess firearms. Applicant and his passenger were arrested and released on \ntheir own recognizance a few hours later. He was charged with two counts of felony \nfirearm possession (which carried a possible 15-year prison sentence), concealing a \ndangerous weapon, possession of marijuana, and speeding. Applicant explained that he \nwas driving his wife\u2019s car and did not realize the gun was in the car. At the hearing, she \ntestified that she placed her loaded gun in the driver\u2019s door pocket the day before when \nshe went into a store. She forgot to place the gun back in her purse, leaving it in the car \nwithout Applicant\u2019s knowledge. He pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and was \nsentenced to probation before judgment for one year. He also pleaded guilty to \npossession of marijuana and received a 90-day suspended sentence. He was fined for \nspeeding. (GE 3, Tr. 105-113) \nApplicant continued to use marijuana on his fishing trips. In March 2018, \nApplicant was working for a municipal transit agency, responsible for providing \nhundreds of millions of rides to patrons each year. The team on which he was working \nwas involved in an incident on the tracks caused by a lapse in safety protocols. \nAlthough neither he nor his team were responsible for the incident, agency protocol \ndictated that all involved in the incident were required to submit to a urinalysis test. He \nwas aware that the transit service, for which he had been working since June 2012, had \na zero-tolerance drug policy. He tested positive for THC and was fired. He was \nunemployed for more than a year. Applicant, the only source of income for his family, \nhad to cash out his retirement account, which contained $100,000 to support his family. \nAt the time, he was 52 years old. (GE 1, 6; Tr. 119, 147, 151-156) \nIn March 2020, Applicant began working for a private transit company. The \ncompany had a zero-tolerance drug policy of which Applicant was aware. In August \n2020, he contracted Covid-19. When the medication he received did not alleviate his \nsymptoms, he testified that his doctor prescribed a medication that he did not want to \ntake. Instead of seeking another medical option to treat his symptoms, Applicant \ndecided to use an over-the-counter cannabidiol (CBD) product. He cannot recall the \nproduct that he used. After doing research on the internet, he believed that the CBD \nproduct he chose did not contain enough THC to be detected on a urinalysis test. He \nwas subject to a random urinalysis in October 2020, tested positive for THC, and was \nfired. He attempted to explain his actions to the employer, to no avail. (Tr. 124-128, 156-\n157, 159-166) \nSince his release from prison in 1996, Applicant has accomplished much. He \nearned a master\u2019s degree from a nationally recognized university in 2000. Shortly after \nearning his master\u2019s degree, he started a business to provide technology equipment \nand solutions to community groups and organizations. He also cofounded a non-profit \norganization providing technical and certification training and testing for low-income \nyouth and young adults, ultimately placing them in information technology positions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoth organizations benefitted his hometown in State 1.

He \nhas earned numerous awards and accommodations for his community service. \nApplicant claims that he has not used marijuana or CBD products since October \n2020. Although he still goes on deep sea fishing trips with the same friend, he now uses \na nausea relief bracelet to deal with seasickness. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the personal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse guidelines. The Government has established a \nprima facie case. Although Applicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use occurred while he \nwas employed in private industry, it remains relevant to a determination of his current \nsecurity worthiness. In a December 2021 memorandum, the Director of National \nSecurity provided guidance on the relevance of recreational marijuana use and CBD \nproduct use in security clearance adjudications: \n\u2026 [P]rior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to \nadjudications but not determinative. The SecEA has provided direction in \nSEAD 4 to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person concept.\" \nThis requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an \nindividual's life to determine whether that individual's behavior raises a \nsecurity concern, if at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated \nsuch that the individual may now receive a favorable adjudicative \ndetermination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, \nfrequency of use and  whether the individual can demonstrate that future \nuse is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or other such \nappropriate mitigation. \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4.\u2026 Additionally, agencies should be aware that \nthe Federal Drug Administration does not certify levels of THC in CBD \nproducts, so the percentage of THC cannot be guaranteed, thus posing a \nconcern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal law. Studies \nhave shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC \nthreshold for hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels (Reference F). \nTherefore, there is a risk that using these products may nonetheless \ncause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test \nunder agency-administered employment or random drug testing programs. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.

(AG \u00b6 15) \nBetween 1988 and 2013, Applicant was arrested five times for drug-related \ncriminal conduct, resulting in multiple felony and misdemeanor convictions \u2013 the most \nserious of which resulted in a 36-month prison sentence. He chose to use marijuana \nand over-the-counter CBD products in violation of two employer\u2019s zero-tolerance \npolicies, resulting in terminations in March 2018 and October 2020 after failing urinalysis \ntests. Applicant\u2019s history of drug-related criminal conduct and drug-related adverse \nemployment actions raise serious questions about his judgment and ability to follow \nlaws, rules, and regulations. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. As a young man, Applicant\u2019s drug use \nand decision to sell drugs had devasting consequences. While abstaining from \nmarijuana between 1998 and 2012, he was able to achieve personal and professional \nsuccess. Despite this he decided to resume marijuana use on multiple occasions even \nafter experiencing significant consequences. \nEach time Applicant used marijuana, he demonstrated significant deficiencies in \njudgment that raise questions about his current security worthiness that he failed to \nexplain, refute, or mitigate. Applicant resumed marijuana use at 48 years old so that he \ncould participate in a recreational activity, deep sea fishing, more comfortably. He, a \nmarried father of three and the sole means of financial support for his family, decided to \nrely upon an illegal drug to remedy a minor medical problem, seasickness, instead of \nseeking readily available and legal medical remedies for the issue. In doing so, he not \nonly chose to engage in illegal behavior, but repeatedly placed the well-being and \nfinancial security of his family at risk. \nAlthough Applicant testified about the 2013 arrest in a casual manner, it was a \nmajor event. What would have been a minor traffic stop was escalated and the criminal \ncharges were aggravated by the presence of marijuana and a firearm. Under these \ncircumstances, he was facing the potential of 15 years incarceration. Even though he \nwas able resolve the incident with minimal criminal consequence, he did not view the \nevent as an opportunity to reconsider his choices, instead, he chose to continue to use \nmarijuana in disregard of federal law and his employer\u2019s policies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe March 2018 termination had devastating personal and financial \nconsequences. He not only exposed his household to the loss of its only source of \nincome for what could have been an indeterminate period, he also had to cash out over \n$100,000 in retirement savings to replace his family\u2019s income, which in one\u2019s fifties is \nnot insignificant. \nAgain, Applicant failed to use the 2018 termination as an opportunity to \nreevaluate his choices regarding marijuana use. When employed at another company \nwith a zero-tolerance drug policy in 2020, he chose to use an unnamed, over-the-\ncounter CBD product to deal with Covid-19 symptoms instead seeking legitimate \nmedical treatment from his physician. He attempted to use CBD products to subvert his \nemployer\u2019s zero tolerance policy relying on his internet research.  \nWhen these incidents and Applicant\u2019s behavior are reviewed as a whole, it \nreveals a pattern of flawed judgment. His use of marijuana has caused him to \nrepeatedly act against his own best interest, in violation of federal law and his \nemployer\u2019s polices, all to purse his preferred recreational activity in comfort. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raises questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). \nThe record establishes that Applicant has a history of marijuana use dating from \nhis sophomore year in high school in 1982 to October 2020. He tested positive for THC \nwhile working in two railway transportation positions for employers with zero-tolerance \ndrug policies in March 2018 and October 2020, respectively. The following disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant, now 58, has a has a 36-year \nhistory of marijuana use. His last reported use occurred over three years ago, which is \nnot a sufficient period of abstinence given his history of drug use. His statements that he \nno longer uses marijuana are not credible. During his investigation in 2009, during a long \nperiod of abstinence, he told the Government that he would not use marijuana in the \nfuture. Not only did he resume marijuana use, he did so repeatedly despite experiencing \nadverse consequences. Furthermore, he continues to go deep sea fishing with the same \nperson with whom he used marijuana. Under these circumstances, I do not find his \ntestimony that he has resolved his seasickness issues with nausea bands credible. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation. This decision is not changed by a consideration of favorable facts in the \nrecord regarding Applicant\u2019s decades of community involvement under the whole \npersona concept in AG \u00b6 2(d). He has demonstrated a pattern of behavior in which he \nroutinely and repeated acted against his best interests to resolve issues with legal and \nreadily available alternatives. At the hearing, he failed to demonstrate an understanding \nof the seriousness of his pattern of conduct and how it negatively reflect on his \njudgment, reliability, ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations. Ultimately, he has \ndemonstrated that he does not possess the good judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness \nrequired of individuals given access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 30 years old, never married, and has no children. She is a high school graduate and attended college from August 2012 to April 2016 but did not receive her degree. Since June 2021, she has been employed by a defense contractor. (GE 1.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has ten delinquent federal student loans, one direct state university student loan totaling $50,470, and three delinquent consumer loans totaling $4,033. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted those allegations. (Answer.) She did not disclose those debts in her SCA (GE 1) but volunteered the student loans in her February 9, 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). (GE 2.)

Her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application (SCA) on November 9, \n2021. On September 26, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that her circumstances raised security concerns \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations). This action was taken under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive).

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nJanuary 26, 2023. The case was assigned to me on September 19, 2023. On March 6, \n2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled to be conducted in person on March 18, 2024. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through AE Z, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 29, \n2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old, never married, and has no children. She is a high school \ngraduate and attended college from August 2012 to April 2016 but did not receive her \ndegree. Since June 2021, she has been employed by a defense contractor. (GE 1.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has ten delinquent federal \nstudent loans, one direct state university student loan totaling $50,470, and three \ndelinquent consumer loans totaling $4,033. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted those allegations. \n(Answer.) She did not disclose those debts in her SCA (GE 1) but volunteered the student \nloans in her February 9, 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). (GE 2.) The summary of \nthe PSI reflects that she thought she had disclosed those 11 student loans in her SCA \nbut did not recall the \u201cspecific details relating to the loans.\u201d (GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s PSI reported that her monthly take-home pay was $5,000 with $2,121 \nin monthly expenses, leaving a net monthly remainder of $2,879. It also reported that she \nsaid her \u201cfinancial status is great.\u201d In that interview, she reported that she began making \nstudent loan payments of $125 to $150 per month in 2017 (how many unknown) but could \nnot afford to continue. She has not made any payments since 2017. She attributed her \ninability to make payments to her periods of unemployment. (GE 2.) At the hearing, she \nproduced no documents evidencing payments in 2017. \nThe median date when the SOR student debts went into collections is 2014. (GE \n3.) All 11 SOR student debts but one are reported to be in collection on the 2021 and \n2023 credit reports. SOR \u00b6 1.g is reported PAYS AS AGREED in the 2023 report. SOR \u00b6 \n1.k, the university student loan, is reported in collection on the 2021 report but is not \nreported on the 2023 report. The student loans went into collections between 2012 and \n2016. All but two of her federal student loans went into collection while she was a student. \n(GE 3 and 4.) \nApplicant testified about having to end her college studies in April 2016. She \nthought she would graduate in 2016, but she was called to the university\u2019s bursar office \nand was told her mother had stopped paying Applicant\u2019s parent plus loans. She learned \nthat her mother's paychecks were being garnished. That left a balance Applicant was \nunable to pay, because she did not have the money. She had only 17 credits left to \ncomplete her studies. (Tr. 17.) During her testimony, it was ascertained that SOR \u00b6 1.k, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na $2,033 debt to the university, was for Applicant, not for her mother, to pay. Her mother \nhad paid her part, but Applicant still owes the $2,033, and that is what prevented her from \nfinishing school. She still owes that amount. (Tr. 18-24.) She believed this student loan \nwas to be included with her federal student loans consolidation but now knows it was not. \n(Tr. 82-83.) There is no evidence that she has addressed or plans to address this debt. \nThis debt has not been resolved. \nApplicant testified about her federal work-study program. She was told that part \nof her pay under that program would go towards her loans. As an example, she referred \nto AE H, a W-2 form from her university for 2014, showing her gross earnings of $707.50 \nfrom that program and a net pay of $191.72 for that year. AE M is a copy of a university \ndirect deposit payable to her for $191.72 dated December 4, 2014. Some of her work \nstudy pay was supposed to be \u201cset aside\u201d to pay for her debt to the university. None of \nthat \u201cset aside\u201d went into her pocket. But later testimony established that the money was \npaid directly to her. (Tr. 36-38.) The only reason she signed up for work-study was to help \npay off her debt. (Tr. 24-27.) \nApplicant testified about how her federal work-study program actually worked. She \nwas referred to AE M, which shows a payment to her of $707.50 year-to-date for that \nprogram as of November 14, 2014. She understood that the money was supposed to be \nhalf-and-half (half to her, half to the loans), but it did not work like that. All of that money \ncame to her directly. She did not save some of that money for student loans, because at \nthe time she was still in school and needed to pay for books, school expenses, and \nvarious other items. (Tr. 36-38.) \nApplicant testified about the period just after she left college in 2016. She came \nhome and took jobs, saving money, trying to do what she needed to do to pay off the \ndebt. The university told her it would take five to seven years to pay off her student debt. \nShe \u201cwas just trying to . . . work, get money, just trying to pay off . . . debts.\u201d But in \nDecember 2017, she was \u201chit with . . . a terrifying death.\u201d Her grandmother passed away. \nIt was a lot for her and her family. \u201cWe had to put up expenses and everything for her \nfuneral. That\u2019s where . . . most -- some of the money I saved went towards that.\u201d At the \ntime, she was working two jobs, one at a restaurant and the second at a jewelry store in \na mall. She had worked at the latter during her school years. Christmas was an important \ntime for the mall store, with everyone doing last-minute shopping. Her boss wanted her \nto come in on Christmas Eve; but her grandmother had died on 3:33 a.m. on Christmas \nEve. Applicant \u201cjust couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d As a result, she was let go from that position.  (Tr. 27-\n28, 30.) \nApplicant testified about her need to search for housing when her grandmother \ndied. Applicant, her mother, her sister, and her aunt had all lived with her grandmother \nbefore she died. Her grandmother was the leaseholder, but nobody in the rest of the \nfamily was on the lease. So, they could not continue living in her grandmother\u2019s house \nonce she died. They found another rental, but it was the most expensive one she had \never seen, $1,700 per month. She was paying for rent, food, Internet, and other expenses. \n(Tr. 29.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified about her tax refunds during her two employments between (1) \nMay 2017 and November 2019 (as a tour guide) and (2) August 2020 and June 2021. \n(GE 1; Tr. 32-33.) She referred to AE D, a U.S. Department of Education (DOE) missive \ndated March 18, 2024, confirming her enrollment of ten federal student loans in Fresh \nStart (page 2) (a loan consolidation program). It also included a page 3 showing her \npayments on her federal student loans. They are listed as a \u201cTreasury Offset.\u201d Those are \namounts intercepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from her income tax refunds \nto be applied to her federal student loans. It shows two offsets from her 2019 refund and \nthree offsets from her 2020 tax refund, totaling $1,777. Those are the only payments that \nwere made towards her federal student loans. (Tr. 33-35, 38.) \nApplicant testified about a job she took in November 2019. The job was pretty \ngood, but she found out from co-workers that the person just before her had been bullied \nby one or more supervisors. When Applicant first started, her workload was \u201cextremely \nhigh,\u201d and she had not been \u201ctrained properly.\u201d Her boss at the time called her into her \noffice and ran down a list, did not let her explain, all of which were \u201chighly incorrect.\u201d So \nshe left that job in March 2020, just as COVID hit. She filed for and was granted \nunemployment (UE) benefits effective February 2020. (AE N.) While on UE benefits, she \nwas unemployed until August 2020, when she took a job with a company that made \u201cID \nand . . . CAC cards\u201d (Common Access Cards). She worked for that company until June \n2021, when she joined her current employer. (Tr. 41-46.) \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.l, an account in collection for $1,460. This \naccount was for furniture she rented for the apartment where she lived from August 2019 \nto February 29, 2024, before moving to her current residence. She explained that some \nof the time she did not have the full amount to pay for the furniture, so she linked the \ncreditor to her bank account. There was a time when the creditor stopped taking payments \nfrom that account, the last payment having been taken on September 4, 2020. She \nbelieved those payments \u201cwere done.\u201d She called and was told the account was closed \nbut she could make payments. So, she set up a new payment plan, with her first payment \nof $150 made on March 14, 2024. She referred to AE E, a \u201cLease Information\u201d document \nshowing payments from an \u201cInitial Payment\u201d on October 17, 2019, through a September \n4, 2020 penultimate payment of $62.29 and the first payment of $150 on the new plan \nmade on March 14, 2024. That document was accessed on March 18, 2024. The Initial \nPayment was $53. Thereafter, the biweekly \u201cRent\u201d (including any \u201cOne Time Payments\u201d) \nwas $62.29. The exhibit shows 36 payment attempts, 12 successful and 24 unsuccessful. \nUnder the new payment plan, AE shows the first payment of $150 was made on March \n14, 2024. This debt was scheduled to be resolved by April 12, 2024. (Tr. 46-48, 77-82.) \nApplicant testified about AE F, J, P, R, and S. AE F is a May 23, 2018 email from \na contractor to Applicant with addresses for the three credit reporting agencies and form \nletters to be sent to her creditors asking them to delete or correct their credit information \nabout her.

At her PSI, she did not recall this account. It pertains to \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. ($2,067) and has been resolved. (GE 2; Tr. 53.) \nApplicant testified about AE O, two pages consisting of: (1) an October 15, 2022 \nemail to her from debtrelief.studentaid.gov confirming her federal student loan debt relief \napplication, and; (2) a November 20, 2022 email to her from U.S. Secretary of Education  \nCardona advising that: (a) she is eligible for loan relief, and (b) lawsuits have blocked his \nability to discharge her loans at present. She offered this exhibit to show that she was \u201cat \nleast trying to . . . do something in regards to making payments.\u201d Her goal was to \nconsolidate her loans and pay them off together. It was clarified that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.i and 1 m. are her federal student loans. These are in the process of being consolidated, \nand she is awaiting the payment plan and when she starts paying. The payments will be \ntaken directly from her bank account. (Tr. 55-57.) \nApplicant was asked to reiterate the dates of unemployment listed in her SCA. She \nwas unemployed from June 2013 to August 2013, because she was in school. She was \nunemployed from April 2015 to June 2015, because she was in school. She was \nunemployed from August 2015 to May 2016, while in school. She attended the university \nfrom 2012 to 2016. She was unemployed from March 2020 to August 2020. Since August \n2020, she has always had full-time employment. (GE 1; Tr. 58-59.) \nDuring school, Applicant lived on campus. Her mother helped by taking out \nseparate parent plus loans. Since Applicant stopped going to school, she has not \npersonally made any payments on her federal student loans. She first tried to consolidate \nher student loans in 2022. She denied that she tried to consolidate her loans because \nshe was applying for her security clearance or had gotten her SOR. She explained that \nshe was \u201cgoing into . . . full adulthood . . . wanted to buy a car . . . put a down payment \non the house . . . [S]he] knew what [she] needed to do.\u201d She needed to pay bills and pay \ndebt off. (Tr. 60-61.) \nApplicant was asked why in 2022 she did not start making payments on her student \nloans. She answered at that point she \u201cwas already on the list to do . . . the consolidation, \nto do . . . debt relief . . . and was just waiting to hear back.\u201d She was also paying off the \nbalance from the apartment where she was living and wanted to move. She was paying \noff other bills and saving up to move. (Tr. 61-63.) \nApplicant agreed that in the beginning of March 2024, she reapplied to consolidate \nher student loan debts in Fresh Start. Thereafter, she was told that her application did not \n\u201cgo through,\u201d so she resubmitted her application \u201cjust this morning\u201d (March 18, 2024). She \nagreed that she still has the same 10 federal student loan debts for approximately \n$49,559. (Tr. 63-64.) \nApplicant was referred to her February 9, 2022 PSI (GE 2), when she said that \nonce the COVID deferment ended she would establish a settlement plan. She was asked \nwhy at that time she did not start making payments to at least pay off some of the interest \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthat was accruing on her student loans.

She was left with \u201cpast \ndue, past due, past due.\u201d (Tr. 64-67.) \nApplicant reiterated that she renewed her Fresh Start loan consolidation the \nmorning of the hearing and was asked when she would begin to make payments. She \nwas told the initial packet would be the sign-up and a layout of how much she is going to \npay. The second packet will have the full payment list and how she is to make payments. \n(Tr. 68.) \nApplicant testified that the plan will take $387 or $400 every two weeks, but she is \ngoing to increase that to $500 every two weeks. She just got a raise and makes about \n$4,500 per month. Her rent now is $1,675 per month, which includes utilities. Groceries \nwill be about $300 per month. She confirmed that she will have about $1,000 to put \ntowards student loans. Applicant is referred to AE D, page 2. All of the ten federal student \nloans appear to be listed there. She has not made any payments on those debts. (Tr. 67-\n73.) \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.n, an account for a cellphone in collection for \n$506. She recounted telephone conversations she had about this account. She switched \nservice from A to B. B was supposed to pay off A for her. Because A was merging into B, \nshe called B and was told the account was so old they could not find it. She was told to \ncall the collection agency. She called the collection agency and was told it was closed \nand had gone back to A. She called A and was told it was so old they could not find the \naccount. \nApplicant testified further about her finances. Her checking account currently has \nabout $400. Her savings account has zero. She had 401(k) accounts in her two previous \njobs, but she needs to look into that. She signed up for a 401(k) with her current job but \ndoes not believe she put anything in it. She will have money left over at the end of every \nmonth. She testified that she was living paycheck-to-paycheck now and was asked how \nshe was going to pay the extra $1,000 [on federal student loans] if she was living \npaycheck-to-paycheck. She explained that she has cut back on expenses, like groceries, \nconsolidated Wi-Fi and phone bills, and does not have cable. She started a business as \na travel agent. When she is done with her eight-hour government job, she still has to do \nher travel agent job. (Tr. 85-92.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n         Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial  Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant's admissions and the credit \nreports. They were in collection when the SOR was issued in September 2022. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (c) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment , . . divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances); and \n(d)  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay     \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s ten federal \nstudent loans went into collections on balance in 2014. In fact, all but two of her \nfederal student loans went into collections while she was still in school between 2012 \nand 2016. Although that is quite some time ago, they remained in collections on the \n2021 and 2023 credit reports (except for one absent from the 2023 credit report). \nThose debts were not infrequent.  \nThey were delinquent when the SOR was issued in September 2022. Applicant \nclaimed in her PSI that she made some payments in 2017 but could not continue them. \nShe attributed her inability to continue to her periods of unemployment. But her periods \nof unemployment were mostly short and while she was in school using student loans \n(6/2013-5/2016). From March 2020 to August 2020, she was unemployed, but she \nreceived unemployment benefits during that period. Since August 2020, she has been \nemployed full-time. \nShe had a $2,879 net monthly remainder at the time of her February 2022 PSI. At \nthat time, she was reported to have said her \u201cfinancial status is great.\u201d At the hearing, she \ntestified that she now has the financial wherewithal to pay $1,000 per month towards her \nfederal student loans. She did not, however, file to consolidate those loans until October \n2022, after her November 2021 SCA, after her February 2022 PSI, and after her SOR \nwas issued in September 2022. In the beginning of March 2024, she reapplied to \nconsolidate her federal student loans. She resubmitted her loan consolidation form the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nThe DOE automatically paused student loan payments and set interest rates to \n0% from March 13, 2020, until Sept. 1, 2023. Because Applicant never made any \npayments on her federal student loans, this pause had no effect on her case.  COVID-19 \nEmergency \nRelief \nand \nFederal \nStudent \nAid: \nFederal \nStudent \nAid \n(.gov) \nhttps://studentaid.gov \u203a announcements-events \u203a covid-19. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmorning of the hearing after being told earlier that it did not \u201cgo through.\u201d She is now \nawaiting her payment schedule. (DOE told her in November 2022 she was eligible.) She \nhas not personally made any documented payments on her federal student loans. \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied that she sought to consolidate her federal student \nloans in 2022, because she had applied for a security clearance or had received her SOR. \nShe explained that she wanted to consolidate because she was going into full adulthood, \nwanted to buy a car, and put a down payment on a house. She needed to pay bills and \npay debt off. Her student loans, however, had been in collections for years, before she \naddressed them. And her financial status looked great in February 2022, only if one \nignored her approximately $50,000 in delinquent student debt. \nIt is difficult not to conclude that Applicant\u2019s sudden interest in addressing her \nfederal student loans was prompted by the advent of her security clearance process. \nFinancial remedial efforts taken by an applicant after the clearance process has \nbegun are often viewed as not being in good faith. At best, the timing of such efforts \nundercuts the weight of remedial actions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). And so it is here. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nI have considered mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d). I found no \nconditions largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control that prevented her from addressing her \nfederal student loans in the many years they were delinquent before she ultimately \ndid so once her national security clearance process was underway. Similarly, \nalthough she did initiate efforts to repay her overdue educational loan creditors, I find \nthat she did so in whole or in large part, because she was under financial scrutiny going \nthrough her clearance process. That undercuts the mitigating weight to be given to those \nremedial efforts. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) do not apply. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through i and m are not mitigated. SOR \u00b6 1.j has been resolved, so I \nfind that allegation mitigated. She has not resolved SOR \u00b6 1.k, so I find that allegation is \nnot mitigated. SOR \u00b6 1.l is in the process of being resolved, so I find that allegation \nmitigated. She used her best efforts to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.n, so I find that allegation \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors).

There are three exhibits \nthat bear favorably on Applicant\u2019s character. They are: \nAE S is an August 6, 2019 letter from her then employer commending her for \npreventing a tourist from entering a prohibited area of the workplace. One her duties at \nthat time was protecting the security of the building. (Tr. 51-53.) \nAE J is a March 10, 2024 character reference letter from one of her high school \nteachers who remained in contact with her through college and into the work force. The \nauthor vouches for her integrity, loyalty, and sense of responsibility. (Tr. 50.) \nAE B is a March 18, 2024 letter from a bank creditor to her confirming that its \ncollection agency received payment in full from her for a debt. This was not alleged in \nthe SOR but shows that she had paid off a debt. The debt was her mother\u2019s, not hers, for \nabout $500. Nonetheless, Applicant settled it for $307 (Tr. 73-75.) \nI have carefully weighed these exhibits. They reflect positively on Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, and I have given them the commendatory value they deserve. \nNevertheless, Applicant leaves me with questions and doubts about her eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.: \n10 \n For Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She denied both allegations with explanations. (Answer) \nFrom July 2015 to March 2020 Applicant worked for various contractors in direct \nsupport of the same defense agency (Agency). She was employed as an EA for Company \nA from August 2016 to October 2019 when she resigned to pursue a better job with \nCompany B. She was employed as a strategic analyst for Company B from October 2019 \nto February 2020. While employed by Companies A and B, Applicant worked in different \nbuildings in the same four-building, campus-like complex on a military installation. Each \nbuilding had multiple access points and accessible parking areas. There was no perimeter \nfence or designated access control point. In early 2020, Agency compared some \ncontractor timecards with building badge swipe records to identify potential timecard \nfraud. (GE 1, 4-5; Tr. 27-34, 80-83, 87) \nOn February 28, 2020, Agency notified Company A that building badge swipe \nrecords from April 2019 through September 2019 reflected a 52-hour discrepancy \nbetween the 973 hours billed for Applicant\u2019s services and the amount of time she was \n\u201cbadged into\u201d an Agency complex. (GE 2 at 1) Agency requested Company A provide \nevidence to rebut the apparent mischarging or reimburse the government for the \ndiscrepancy plus a fee. In March 2020, Company A confirmed a discrepancy between \nAgency internal badging records and company records and found that \u201c977 hours were \nbilled and 56.75 hours were not allocable to the contract . . . . with an actual cost of \n$3,219.28 and fee of $160.96, for a total of $3,380.24 due to the Government.\u201d (GE 3) \nCompany A reimbursed the Government for the discrepant hours.

This was a flawed process which [Company A \nchose] not to appeal, and paid back any difference found. The flaw comes \nwhen an Admin Assistant leaves the building and makes a delivery or pick \nup related to their job. [Agency\u2019s] position was that an individual could not \nhave worked the total hours claimed if they were not in the building for that \nnumber of hours. Administrative Assistants are often asked to \u201crun errands\u201d \nfor their job. . . . Since [we] could not adjudicate whether the time was \nfraudulently entered or not, we decided to simply pay back this amount. It \nwas my judgement this was not sufficient evidence to enter an incident \nreport on the individual. (GE 4)      \nApplicant denied the SOR allegation regarding Company A and identified problems \nwith the badging system in the building where she worked. (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Answer). She \nexplained that \u201cI had no idea there was an investigation nor was I given a chance to refute \nthe findings.\u201d (Answer) Notably, Company A\u2019s assessment of Applicant\u2019s original and \ncorrected timesheets from April 15, 2019 through September 2019 showed no difference \nin her hours worked except two periods were \u201ccorrected\u201d to show more hours than \noriginally claimed (100.50 to 105.50, and 88 to 89.25 hours). (GE 5 at 23, 26) Company \nA identified 63 hours Applicant worked as \u201cUnbillable Labor.\u201d (GE 5 at 1)  \nOn Friday, February 28, 2020, Applicant\u2019s supervisor at Company B informed her \nthat Agency identified an estimated 39-hour discrepancy between her timesheets and \nAgency access card swipe logs from October 2019 to December 2019. On Monday, \nMarch 2, 2020, at 1:41 PM, Applicant\u2019s supervisor sent her an email identifying nine dates \nfrom October 2019 through December 2019 with more than an hour discrepancy between \nhours reported on her timesheet and Agency badging records. (GE 6) He also asked if \nshe had been able to corroborate that she had been approved to work some hours from \nhome and said he needed her information by the end of the workday so he could timely \nrespond to Agency. (GE 6-7; Tr. 25-29, 37-39, 87-88, 94-97) Applicant\u2019s response later \nthat day included: \n[Company B] has already started the ball removing me as an employee. No \nmatter what I have found the bottom line is, will it change anything? Along \nwith the undercharged time there is overcharged time reflected.

I filed for unemployment, was denied \nand in the hearing I found out the company had received the inquiry weeks \nearlier than when I was notified. They also stressed the fact that I left \npreempting the investigation, they at the time had no intention of firing me. \nI jumped the gun and now understand I was to[o] emotional. (GE 1 at 14) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at hearing, statements to a government investigator during \na December 2020 background interview, and explanations in her Answer to the SOR were \ngenerally consistent. She denied falsifying timecards at any time she worked as a federal \ncontractor. She said that on Friday, February 28, 2020, her supervisor at Company B \ninvited her to an offsite location where he informed her that Agency had identified an \nestimated 39-hour discrepancy between her timesheets and Agency access card swipe \nlogs from October 1, 2019 to December 1, 2019. She denied that she falsified her time \nsheet and asked if she could obtain emails and personal records including notes about \nher daily duties to prepare her response. Her supervisor said that he would try to get \nsomeone to send it to her. He retrieved her Agency access badge, provided her a copy \nof the audit, said she had until Friday, March 6, 2020, to explain the discrepancies, and \nhe sent her home. (Answer; GE 6-7; Tr. 25-29, 37-53, 66-70, 83-84, 87, 94-101) \nApplicant was unable to return to her agency workspace to access her computer \nor her notes or to otherwise research records to document her work hours before \nreceiving the email from her supervisor on Monday, March 2, 2020. After receiving the \nemail from her supervisor, she requested a coworker retrieve her notes and other \ninformation. The coworker informed Applicant that she could not retrieve the notebook \nbecause Applicant\u2019s belongings were being packed up for delivery to Company B. \nApplicant had seen other employees treated in a similar manner and believed she had no \nviable recourse to research or resolve the time discrepancies. She believed she was \nabout to be terminated; she felt that she was being treated unfairly; and she was frustrated \nand angry. She was also aware that being fired could affect her security clearance, so \nshe immediately resigned via email. She stated her belief that if she had been given \naccess to her office and more time that she could have provided a logical response and \nevidence to explain the discrepancies. She received her personal belongings including \nher notebooks about two weeks later. She said that she later learned that Company B \nhad no intention to fire her and that she reacted too emotionally by resigning. (GE 1, 6-7; \nAE B; Tr. 25-27, 40-50, 61-63, 83-89, 90-101) \nApplicant said Agency swipe log records were inaccurate, that the Agency badging \nsystem was often down and transitioning from access badges to common access cards, \nand that security personnel would often have to manually open turn styles at building \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccess points.

She acknowledged \nthat she sometimes returned late from lunch but said she was never more than 30 minutes \nlate. She said her job responsibilities required her to walk to other buildings, that she often \nused an entrance without badge swipe access and that security personnel would visually \ninspect badges and allow entry or exit. She said workers were not required to access the \nAgency building via a specified access point, and that there was no way for Agency to \naccurately audit time spent in the building through card swipe records due to turn style \nissues and an entrance that did not have a turn style. (Answer; GE 7; Tr. 27-29, 34-37, \n58-62, 80-83, 102-104) \nApplicant testified that the only time she entered inaccurate information into her \ntimecard was at the direction of her program manager and supervisor during a six-month \nperiod not alleged in the SOR. She said Company A employees were sometimes required \nto work more than eight hours by Agency, but could not request overtime and were \nprohibited from claiming more than 40 hours per week. She said Company A employees \nwere directed to submit timesheets showing no more than 40 hours worked per week, \nthat Company A tracked and treated any excess hours worked as compensatory time off, \nand that Agency was aware of the practice. (Tr. 63-71; GE 5-6) \nAn Agency executive that Applicant supported as an EA while employed by \nCompany A noted her responsibilities included handling classified information, \nadministrative matters, and customer interaction.

He also provided his \u201chighest recommendation.\u201d (AE H) Six current or former \nAgency executives commented favorably on her conscientiousness, work ethic, integrity, \ncommitment to people and mission, and reliability.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . .  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing[.] \nRecord evidence including Applicant\u2019s statements show discrepancies existed \nbetween her employee time sheets and Agency badge swipe records, that Company A \nrefunded approximately $3,380 to the government because of those discrepancies, and \nthat she resigned from Company B after being informed of discrepancies and because \nshe believed she was about to be terminated. This conduct raises the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe accuracy of the time worked information is important both to federal \ncontractors and government agencies that contract with them. Intentional falsification of \ntime keeping records reflects questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. However, the SOR does not allege \nintentional falsification or fraudulent submission of timekeeping records. It alleges \nCompany A refunded approximately $3,380 to the government due to discrepancies \nbetween Applicant\u2019s reported time and government badge swipe records, and that \nApplicant resigned from Company B in lieu of termination due to timecard discrepancies. \nThe SOR allegations were derived from comparison of contractor timecards with \nAgency badge swipe records to identify potential timecard fraud in 2019 and early 2020. \nCompany A concluded this \u201cwas a flawed process\u201d because it failed to recognize \nadministrative personnel are often required to leave their assigned work area to perform \ntasks. (GE 4) Company A\u2019s FSO determined this comparison was so unreliable that it \nwas insufficient to warrant a security incident report. And there is no evidence Company \nB investigated the alleged discrepancies or determined that the discrepancies were \nattributable to intentional falsification. Although this could be attributable, in part, to \nApplicant\u2019s speedy resignation, she has claimed she later learned that Company B did \nnot intend to terminate her employment. \nApplicant consistently claimed that her duties required her to go to different \nbuildings both inside and outside of the Agency complex. She detailed various issues with \nthe Agency badge swiping system that raise additional questions about the reliability of \nthis system as a time worked measure. She has also consistently claimed she was first \nnotified of the discrepancies between her Company B time keeping records and Agency \nrecords on a Friday, told she had one-week to review records and produce evidence \naddressing them, prohibited from accessing her workspace or records, and that she \nrequested her supervisor provide her personal records so she could prepare her \nresponse. The next work-day afternoon her supervisor requested she submit her \nexplanation and evidence regarding discrepancies that same day. Unable to access her \nwork computer or review her notes, Applicant contacted a coworker for assistance and \nwas informed her belongings were being packed up. She has acknowledged that she felt \nthat she was being treated unfairly and was frustrated, and that she acted too emotionally \nwhen she resigned from Company B because she believed her termination was imminent. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (e), and (f) are established. The evidence that Applicant may have \nintentionally falsified timecards or engaged in a pattern of dishonesty is unsubstantiated. \nHer disclosures in her SCA, December 2020 background interview, Answer to the SOR \nand testimony are consistent, credible, and corroborated in significant part by evidence \nsubmitted by the Government.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s work history, security clearance history, character evidence, and \nthat she has openly and consistently disclosed the reasons that she resigned from \nCompany B. \nI found Applicant's responses and demeanor at the hearing to be credible and \nconsistent with someone who was reliably telling the truth. After reviewing the entire \nrecord, I find that her hearing testimony is corroborated by documentary evidence \nsubmitted by the government and her own exhibits. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He has worked as a cyber architect for a defense contractor since 2018. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016 and two master\u2019s degrees in 2020 and 2022. He married in 2005 and has three minor children. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1) In 2014, Applicant was motivated to finish his college education and change career directions. He had good credit at the time, and opened multiple lines of credit with the belief that his financial situation would greatly improve in the coming years. He admitted that he started spending frivolously and living beyond his means. While his income improved, it was not enough to sustain his lifestyle, and the debts went unpaid. (Tr. 20- 24; GE 2) In Applicant\u2019s April 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he disclosed he did not intend to pay his accumulated unsecured debts. Instead, he planned to weather the storm as the collections and lawsuits came in over the next several years.

Applicant answered the SOR on July 30, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2023. \nThe hearing convened, as scheduled, on September 27, 2023.

His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence \nsubmitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He has worked as a cyber architect for a defense \ncontractor since 2018. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016 and two master\u2019s degrees \nin 2020 and 2022. He married in 2005 and has three minor children. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1) \nIn 2014, Applicant was motivated to finish his college education and change career \ndirections. He had good credit at the time, and opened multiple lines of credit with the \nbelief that his financial situation would greatly improve in the coming years. He admitted \nthat he started spending frivolously and living beyond his means. While his income \nimproved, it was not enough to sustain his lifestyle, and the debts went unpaid. (Tr. 20-\n24; GE 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he \ndisclosed he did not intend to pay his accumulated unsecured debts. Instead, he planned \nto weather the storm as the collections and lawsuits came in over the next several years. \nHe admitted he made poor decisions with his finances but that he was at peace with his \ndecision to not pay what he owes. (GE 2 at page 8) \nOver time, several creditors sued him to collect the debts, and Applicant testified \nhe paid them because of those lawsuits. However, he did not provide documentation of \nthese payments. He admitted he was irresponsible with his finances for no good reason. \n(Tr. 20-24) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he resolved most of the SOR debts within the \nlast month. He stated that he and his wife took out a $95,000 home equity loan to do \nhome improvements, and he used a significant portion to settle the SOR debts. He \nadmitted that the outstanding balance from the debts was not actually paid off; rather it \nwas moved from multiple creditors to the home equity loan lender. He admitted that he \ndid not attempt to settle these debts at an earlier date. He did not have the liquidity to \nmake settlement offers, because he spent almost all the money that he earned every \nmonth living beyond his means. (Tr. 20-24, 33-39) \nApplicant reported that in 2018, he started making about $130,000 annually with \nhis current employer, and that he has made $160,000 for the last two years. He has about \n$8,000 in savings left after the home equity loan expenditures. He has about $140,000 in \nhis retirement account, from saving 8% of his yearly income. He has not had credit \ncounseling and he did not provide a monthly budget. (Tr. 24-39) \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $127,512. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an account placed for collection for $34,366.

(AE I) \nThe unalleged debt may not be an independent basis for revoking Applicant\u2019s clearance, \nbut I may consider it to evaluate Applicant\u2019s credibility; to evaluate his evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for the whole \nperson analysis. I have considered this unalleged debt for these limited purposes. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are established by the credit report and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts, other than \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are being paid, are \nresolved, or became delinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. The \ntwo paid debts were settled about a month before the hearing and over a year after \nreceiving the SOR, which is not mitigating. His failure to pay these debts is both long-term \nand recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat these debts resulted from conditions beyond his control or that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \na good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and he has not \nestablished any meaningful track record of debt payments. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising out of his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 58-year-old married man with two adult children. He has a high school education and is an electrician. (Tr. 19) He has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2021. (Tr. 31) Between 2012 and 2020, Applicant\u2019s wife, a bookkeeper at a real estate law firm, embezzled between $499,000 and $575,0002 from her employer, a four-partner law firm. (Tr. 21; GE B) Her employer discovered this criminal activity in January 2020 and fired her. In August 2020 she was arrested and charged criminally with embezzlement, unlawful conversion, and fraud. (GE B at 64) Applicant\u2019s wife conducted a scheme whereupon she would open credit cards, either jointly with Applicant or solely in his name, and use them to take cash advances. Then, she would transfer money from her employer to her personal accounts and use this stolen money to pay back the credit cards. (Answer at 4; Tr. 22) Initially, she would deposit money back into her employer\u2019s account after embezzling it, but her credit card spending gradually eclipsed the amount that she was re-depositing into the employer\u2019s account.

On \nApril 12, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling the hearing for May 16, 2024. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the \nhearing, I received five Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 5), six exhibits of Applicant \n(Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) A through AE F), and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the close of the \nhearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request for him to submit additional exhibits. \nWithin the time allotted, he submitted a signed copy of AE C, a copy of a release and \nsettlement agreement, dated April 21, 2021. I incorporated this exhibit into the file, \nreplacing the copy of AE C originally submitted, which was an unsigned document. The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on May 28, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 58-year-old married man with two adult children. He has a high school \neducation and is an electrician. (Tr. 19) He has been working for his current employer, a \ndefense contractor, since 2021. (Tr. 31) \nBetween 2012 and 2020, Applicant\u2019s wife, a bookkeeper at a real estate law firm, \nembezzled between $499,000 and $575,0002 from her employer, a four-partner law firm. \n(Tr. 21; GE B) Her employer discovered this criminal activity in January 2020 and fired her. \nIn August 2020 she was arrested and charged criminally with embezzlement, unlawful \nconversion, and fraud. (GE B at 64) Applicant\u2019s wife conducted a scheme whereupon she \nwould open credit cards, either jointly with Applicant or solely in his name, and use them to \ntake cash advances. Then, she would transfer money from her employer to her personal \naccounts and use this stolen money to pay back the credit cards. (Answer at 4; Tr. 22) \nInitially, she would deposit money back into her employer\u2019s account after embezzling it, but \nher credit card spending gradually eclipsed the amount that she was re-depositing into the \nemployer\u2019s account. (Tr. 21) \nAccording to one of the partners at the firm where Applicant\u2019s wife worked, her \ncriminal scheme at evading scrutiny was very complex because she disguised the \ntransactions to make them appear to be legitimate. (GE B at 30) The first forensic \naccounting firm who the employer hired to ascertain how much money was stolen was \nunable to do so because it did not have \u201cthe level of expertise for the complication of how \nthe money was being stolen.\u201d (Tr 25) Moreover, per one of the law firm partners, they did \nnot recognize that she was stealing from them \u201cbecause they were so busy within the firm,\u201d \nand had \u201cno reason to believe that she had done anything inappropriate previously.\u201d (Tr. \n26) \nApplicant contends that he did not know that his wife was engaged in this conduct \nbecause she managed all their financial affairs, and he never looked at his bank accounts \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause he was pre-occupied with his job, typically working ten to twelve hours per day. \n(Tr. 41, 49, 51) Moreover, there were no indicators of any lavish spending in their home \nsuch as new furniture, new cars, or flashy jewelry. (Tr. 46, 63) In addition, other than plane \ntickets to a resort for a vacation paid for by Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, they did not spend \nmuch money on traveling. (Tr. 39, 43) They lived what Applicant characterized as a typical \nworking-class lifestyle in a 2,400 square foot home shared with their two adult children and \ntheir son-in-law, and driving three economy cars that Applicant owned, all of which were \nmodels nine or more years old. (AE B at 67; Tr. 21) Moreover, Applicant sometimes \nperformed some catering events on the side, preparing barbecue for customers hosting \nspecial events. (AE F at 6) \nApplicant was aware that his family\u2019s finances were sometimes \u201ctight,\u201d particularly \nbetween August 2014 and May 2015 when he was unemployed. (Tr. 31, 40; AE B at 64) \nHowever, when he periodically asked his wife about their finances, she would reassure him \nthat they were making ends meet. (Tr. 40) When Applicant discovered his wife\u2019s \nembezzlement, they were earning a combined salary of approximately $80,000. (Tr. 33, 36) \nIn August 2020, Applicant\u2019s wife was indicted. (Tr. 37) In January 2021, Applicant\u2019s \nwife pleaded guilty, and after a sentencing hearing eight months later, sentenced to 20 \nyears of incarceration with 12 years suspended. (AE B at 37; Tr. 37) Applicant was not \ncharged criminally with any crime of complicity. Applicant\u2019s wife is currently incarcerated. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s conviction, he began going through her old email and text \nmessages to discover where she was spending the money stolen from her ex-employer. \nHis efforts were unsuccessful. (Tr. 50) \nApplicant was not charged criminally. However, his wife\u2019s ex-employer included him \nin a civil claim filed against his wife for embezzlement, unlawful conversion, fraud, and \nconspiracy. The claim alleged that \u201c[Applicant] was an active participant in the scheme to \ndefraud [plaintiff] and benefitted from the unlawful theft and conversion . . .\u201d (GE 3 at 7) \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s former employer requested a judgment for $606,813. (GE 3 at 11) \nApplicant denied the allegations. In April 2021, he settled the claim and agreed to pay his \nwife\u2019s ex-employer $275,000 in restitution in exchange for a release from any further \nliability. (AE C) Applicant generated the money to settle the claim by selling land he had \ninherited that had been owned by his family for 100 years. (Tr. 67) \nUnable to satisfy the credit card debts that Applicant\u2019s wife incurred in his name, \nApplicant in December 2021, filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (Answer \nat 1) Approximately $200,000 was discharged through the bankruptcy. \nCurrently, Applicant manages his finances. He keeps a tight budget. (Tr. 66) His \nchildren help with making ends meet by paying $400 to $600 per month for household \nexpenses. (Tr. 64) \nApplicant is meticulous about his job responsibilities. According to a coworker, he \nhas observed him reminding other electricians to adhere to policy, and reporting violations \nto superiors.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in deciding. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Between 2012 and 2020, Applicant\u2019s wife embezzled approximately $500,000 from her \nemployer by transferring it from her employer\u2019s account to accounts that she owned jointly \nwith Applicant. This raises the question of whether AG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cunexplained affluence, as \nshown by  . . . [an] increase in net worth, or money transfers that are inconsistent with \nknown legal sources of income.\u201d  \nApplicant contends that he was unaware that so much money was moving into and \nout of his bank accounts because his wife was responsible for managing the family \nfinances, and he did not monitor his accounts. Moreover, there was no evidence reflecting \na wealthy lifestyle, nor anything to raise suspicion that his wife was bringing home any \nmore money than the working-class wages to which they were accustomed, as they were \nliving in a modest home shared with their two adult children and a son-in-law, and driving \nold-model, used cars. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant\u2019s explanation was \ncredible. \nApplicant certainly could have been more diligent in monitoring his bank accounts. \nHowever, given his wife\u2019s expertise as a bookkeeper and the lack of any indicia of \nunexplained affluence, his failure to check their accounts does not rise to the level of a \nsecurity risk. \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is also bolstered by the fact that Applicant took good-faith \nefforts at restitution by paying his wife\u2019s employer $275,000 through selling land that he had \ninherited and resolving the credit card debt, incurred by his wife, through the Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy process. (AG \u00b6 20(d)) \nIn sum, I conclude that because Applicant credibly explained the source of the \naffluence and why he was not aware of it, AG \u00b6 19(g) does not apply. Applicant has \nmitigated the financial consideration security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) When Applicant failed to check his bank accounts, he unwittingly \nenabled his wife to use them as a conduit for embezzlement from her employer.

Although the amount of the \nsettlement was less than the amount that his wife had stolen over the years, it was not \ninsignificant, given his limited means. I conclude that this good-faith effort at restitution \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d Applicant has mitigated the \npersonal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to the mitigating conditions, I considered the character reference of \nApplicant\u2019s coworker. Upon considering all of the mitigating and disqualifying conditions in \nthe context of the whole-person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2:a \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the pleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old. He has three adult children. He married in 2003 and divorced in 2005. He married a second time in 2005 and divorced in 2007. He married a third time in 2008 and divorced in 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016, and a master\u2019s degree in 2019. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a senior manufacturing planner since about 2021. (Tr. 14-19; GE 1) In 2007, Applicant was 37 years old and married. His children were teenagers, although they were not living with him. During this time, he conversed with women that he met online. In March of that year, he sent an instant message to a person in a chatroom that he believed to be a 14-year-old girl. He asked her sexually explicit questions, sent and requested photos, and discussed sexual topics with her through instant messages over a two-week period. She messaged him several photos of a fourteen-year-old girl. He also had several phone calls with her and discussed a meeting in person.

His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nevidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. He has three adult children. He married in 2003 and \ndivorced in 2005. He married a second time in 2005 and divorced in 2007. He married a \nthird time in 2008 and divorced in 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2019. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a senior \nmanufacturing planner since about 2021. (Tr. 14-19; GE 1) \nIn 2007, Applicant was 37 years old and married. His children were teenagers, \nalthough they were not living with him. During this time, he conversed with women that \nhe met online. In March of that year, he sent an instant message to a person in a chatroom \nthat he believed to be a 14-year-old girl. He asked her sexually explicit questions, sent \nand requested photos, and discussed sexual topics with her through instant messages \nover a two-week period. She messaged him several photos of a fourteen-year-old girl. He \nalso had several phone calls with her and discussed a meeting in person. (Tr. 19-61; GE \n2, 3) \nAfter arranging a meeting, Applicant drove 30 miles to her house. He testified that \nhe had no intention to have sex with her, but rather was going to take her to the movies. \nHowever, he had a condom with him in his car. He claimed that he told her to ask her \nparents if she could go with him, however the chat log shows that she told him that her \nparents were away, and only a sibling was home. (Tr. 19-61; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant claimed that he called her to let her know he was there when he arrived \nat her house. He claimed that over the phone she invited him in, but he declined the \ninvitation. He attempted to leave, but his car was blocked by several police officers. \nApplicant was arrested in a sting operation targeting persons sexually soliciting minors \non the internet. (Tr. 19-61; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with three felonies: computer statements for \npurpose of sexual conduct; use of computer services to seduce, solicit, a child; and \nattempt lewd or lascivious battery: engage in a sex act. He reported that prosecutors \nwanted him to register as a sex offender. Applicant spent about a year in jail and pled \nnolo contendere to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a child. \nHe was found guilty and sentenced to time served and a fine. He stated that he was not \nrequired to participate in probation or counseling. (Tr. 19-61; GE 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant stated that he never participated in any counseling or rehabilitation \nprograms and does not need any because \u201che is not sick in the head\u201d. He asserted that \nthis was a onetime mistake and that he is remorseful. He claimed that he has not had any \nprior or subsequent criminal conduct or sexual offenses.

He claimed that he reported this conduct and conviction \nto his employer when applying for his job, and to the U.S. Government when he applied \nfor citizenship in 2016. He submitted documentation about his performance at work, \nacademic transcripts, and two character letters. He reported that he is still chatting with \nwomen that he meets online but has been dating someone recently. (Tr. 19-61) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions, court and police records, and \nhis background interview. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, and he tried to \nminimize his behavior throughout the hearing. The evidence shows that he used the \ninternet to solicit a girl he believed to be 14 years old for sex, and later traveled a \nconsiderable distance to have sexual relations with her. Since he failed to exhibit candor \nand maintained a false narrative of the events at the hearing, I am unable to find that it \noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and that it does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s solicitation of a minor for sex on the internet, \nand attempt to meet her for sexual relations, and his continued false narrative of his \nconduct, shows his continued vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s solicitation of a minor for sex on the internet \nand attempt to meet her for illegal sexual relations is not private or discreet. His behavior \ncame to the attention of the police, which resulted in his arrest, jail time, and conviction \non a related charge. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged the allegation in \u00b6 1.a, which was established under \nGuideline D. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior was criminal in nature, \nand he was arrested for it, spent time in jail, and was convicted on a related charge. \nAlthough the conduct occurred in 2007, he continues to maintain a false narrative about \nthe circumstances and minimizes his conduct. There is insufficient evidence to find there \nis mitigation by the passage of time, or that it is unlikely to recur. It continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. While Applicant provided some evidence \nof subsequent schooling and employment performance, he did not provide sufficient \nevidence to find that there has been successful rehabilitation, or mitigation by the passage \nof time or other factors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character references. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D and J in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the sexual \nbehavior and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact There are seven delinquent accounts alleged in the April 2022 SOR. The eighth allegation alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition in 2001 that was discharged in October 2001. The seven delinquent debts are for credit-card accounts and medical accounts. The total amount of debt is $28,624. The debts became delinquent between April 2015 and January 2022.

On July 29, 2020, he provided an interview (PSI) with an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services \n(CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue a security clearance, \nand issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 5, 2022, detailing \nsecurity concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline F).

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 7, 2023, \nfor a hearing on August 29, 2023. The hearing was held by Teams video teleconference \nas scheduled. I entered the Government\u2019s ten exhibits (GE) 1-10 into evidence without \nobjection. The record remained open until September 13, 2023 to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit post-hearing documentation in support of his hearing testimony. \nOn September 25, 2023. Applicant submitted a 32 page exhibit containing: (1) a two-\npage position statement (A1A-A1B; (2) a spread sheet depicting payment history; (3) \ncredit card-account balances with reduced balances from earlier dates during the life of \nthe card; (4) six different credit reports posting the same date (September 24, 2023); (5) \nan undated budget; and (6): a September 5, 2023 letter (with a copy) from the collection \nagency for SOR \u00b6 1.g, with a handwritten note in the upper right hand corner of the \nexhibit claiming that the account was paid in December 2021. \nOn September 26, 2023, Department Counsel interposed no objection to the \nexhibit, but noted that Applicant\u2019s large donation to charity evoked the suggestion that \nhe was not overly concerned about addressing his liability to the SOR \u00b6 1.d creditor. \nThe exhibit has been marked and entered into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit AE A. \n(AE A1A-A2A; AE A1-32) DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 12, 2023. \nThe hearing record closed on September 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThere are seven delinquent accounts alleged in the April 2022 SOR. The eighth \nallegation alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition in 2001 that was \ndischarged in October 2001. The seven delinquent debts are for credit-card accounts \nand medical accounts. The total amount of debt is $28,624. The debts became \ndelinquent between April 2015 and January 2022. Applicant admitted that he owed all \nbut two of the listed debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d), but claimed that he resolved some of \nthe debts, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). The Government credit bureau reports and \nApplicant\u2019s June 2022 Answer to the SOR verify the delinquent accounts. (GE 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant is 52 years old. He has owned his own home since 2008. He has no \nmilitary history. He has been married since November 1994. He has held a security \nclearance since January 2009. (GE 1 at 8-28) \nIn 1994, Applicant received a certificate in computer technology. Since May \n2022, he has been working as a Linux engineer for a subsidiary of his previous \nemployer where he worked as a Unix administrator from May 2014 to May 2022. He has \nheld previous employment in Unix administration or support.

(GE 3 at 1-2; June 2022 Answer to the \nSOR; Tr. 28) However, he provided no documentation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit-card account that became delinquent in May 2019. \nApplicant contended that he had a statement from the bank designating him as the \nauthorized user. He helped the account holder pay off the account, but did not produce \ndocumentation to support his claim. (GE 3 at 7; Tr. 28) The account is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is credit-card account that Applicant indicated in his June 2022 \nanswer was still delinquent. At the hearing, he claimed that he paid the bill. (Tr. 28-29) \nWith no documentation, I find the debt has not been paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a balance that Applicant owes on a repossessed car. He agrees \nthat he remains liable. The account became delinquent in 2013 when his wife lost her \njob. The car was repossessed and Applicant never returned the account to a current \nstatus. In his May 2020 e-QIP, Applicant tried to negotiate a settlement but the creditor \ndeclined the settlement terms. Applicant\u2019s last attempt to settle the account was \nbetween 2021 and August 2022. At some point during the negotiations, he offered a \nmonthly payment $300, but the creditor refused to accept the terms. Applicant indicated \nthat \u201cI guess I can \u2013 I can provide the documentation of that conversation\u201d (referring to \nsettlement negotiations). (GED 3 at 8; Tr. 41, 43-44) No documentation was presented. \nThe account is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a medical account turned over to collection in April 2020. Though \nApplicant claimed that he paid the account, he provided no documentation to confirm \nthat he paid. (GE 5 at 5; Tr. 29) The debt remains unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a medical account that became delinquent in July 2020. Applicant \nclaimed that he paid the account though he did not have documentary support. (GE 5 at \n5; Tr. 29-30) The account is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a credit-card account that became delinquent in June 2020. \nApplicant indicated in his July 2020 PSI that the account was in a current status. In his \nSeptember 2023 post-hearing documentation, Applicant indicated that he paid the \naccount in December 2021. (GE 5 at 6; GE 10 at 2; Tr. 45-46; AE A at 31) His claim that \nhe paid the account in December 2021 discredits his earlier claim that the account was \ncurrent in July 2020. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) because he \nlost his job and was the sole provider of the household. He also had to care for his wife \nwho was in the hospital. He completed the mandatory financial counseling required by \nthe bankruptcy court in order to complete the bankruptcy petition. He has had no other \nfinancial counseling.

In \nJanuary 2022, he had surgery. When he began working for a short period as a Linux \nengineer in May 2022, he could not collect disability, so he entered a long-term disability \nstatus without pay. For most of calendar year 2022, Applicant lived off his savings \naccount until the account was almost liquidated. He had a second surgery in August \n2022. He recovered and, in December 2022, he began earning $15,000 a month before \ntaxes. (Tr. 31-35) \nApplicant has a $7,700 monthly remainder, but he is spending that remainder \non other credit-card accounts totaling about $15,000. Those other credit-card accounts \nare not alleged in the SOR, although some were delinquent at one time or another. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g was delinquent, but became current in June 2023. Applicant is paying off \nmedical bills in amounts of $500 a month. He does not know how much he owes in \ntotal. He used his $401(k) retirement account to pay medical bills and his living costs \nwhile he was unemployed in 2022. His mother has been living with him since 2008. His \nmother-in-law has been living with him since 2022. However, he does not know how \nmuch he spends to support them. His last purchase of a car was in 2014. His last house \npurchase was in 2008. Applicant\u2019s wife earns about $3,000 a month. (Tr. 34-39) \nHaving carefully evaluated Applicant\u2019s testimony, I find his credibility damaged \nby presenting almost no evidence in support of his claims of solving certain debts and \npaying on others. In response to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, Applicant stated he \nhad the documentation to support his testimony, but he produced no independent \nevidence. Apparently, Applicant has decided to suspend further attempts to settle the \naccount with SOR \u00b6 1.d. Though his credit picture has improved as he has been paying \nmore accounts in a timely fashion, with his most recent missed payment over 3 years \nago, the negative comments by the credit agency reflect his serious debt delinquency \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) and his high credit usage. (AE A at 21-23) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government credit reports \nestablish that all the debts listed in the SOR have been delinquent from 2015 to July \n2020. Though Applicant stressed that he paid several of the listed accounts, the only \nresolved account that is supported by documentation is SOR \u00b6 1.g. However, Applicant \ntook conflicting positions regarding the status of that account between July 2020 and \nSeptember 2023. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes $27,983 in delinquent \ndebt to six creditors or collection agencies. One listed debt became delinquent in 2015. \nHowever, the remaining four debts became delinquent within the last five years. The \nabsence of documentary proof of solution for the outstanding listed delinquencies \ncontinues to raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe medical problems and surgery of Applicant\u2019s wife in 2013, and his two \nsurgeries in January and August 2022 have been considered. Missing from this medical \nevidence is the nature of the surgeries, documented reasons why Applicant did not \nreceive disability insurance, the documented impact of Applicant\u2019s unemployment in \n2022 to his savings account, and any additional information concerning the medical \nproblems that exacerbated Applicant\u2019s financial strife in 2022. At the very least, \nApplicant should have taken some action to contact and negotiate payment plans with \nthe creditors, or at least inform the creditors of his financial plight. \nApplicant testified that his $7,700 monthly remainder was used to pay the non-\nSOR credit-card creditors. This claim has very little probative impact unless it is \naccompanied with evidence, i.e., payment stubs, receipts, bank ledgers, that show \nactual payments to these non-SOR creditors. \nWhile Applicant had mandated financial counseling when he filed his Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy petition in 2001, there is very little evidence that he made the necessary \nchanges in his financial habits over the years. The reason for this conclusion comes \nfrom Applicant\u2019s 2023 CBR, where the credit bureau is on record believing that his high \ncredit use jeopardized his financial profile. \nThough Applicant receives some credit under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20 (c) for \nexperiencing conditions beyond his control, the credit due him under the second prong \nof AG \u00b6 20(c) is reduced substantially because there is insufficient justification to \nconclude that his debts are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because \nApplicant is not engaged in a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been married since 1994. He has been employed as a Linux \nengineer since May 2022. \nExcept for settling with the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.g, the remaining \ndelinquent accounts are in the same status in February 2024 as they were in April 2022, \nwhen the SOR was issued. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial difficulties that \ntrace to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and discharge in October 2001. The lack of \ndocumentation to shore up Applicant\u2019s medical claims and his assertions where he was \nspending the large monthly remainder, undercut his overall credibility. He was unable to \nestimate how much he spends to support his mother and mother-in-law. Having \nweighed and balanced the mitigating and disqualifying evidence, Applicant has not met \nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under the guideline for financial considerations. \nAssuming that Applicant is relying on a limitations statute to avoid responsibility \nfor some of the SOR debt because it has been removed from his credit report and is no \nlonger enforceable, the debt is still significant for security clearance purposes. See \nISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016) Relying on the statute of \nlimitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to eliminate financial troubles. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) In Guideline F cases, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish by documentation his case in \nmitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments \nthat result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, \n2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is \npaid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and has taken \nsignificant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. \nBd.

Regarding the two charges involving his \nfraternization with Marines B, he admitted one, and denied the other. He denied the \ncharges involving harassment and the use of inappropriate and offensive language. There \nis no indication he disclosed, during his 2020 interview, the prior acknowledgments of \nguilt he made in his RFR. \nApplicant admitted the Article 134 and 133 charges (Charge II, Specification 1; \nCharge IV, Specification 1) involving his sexual relationship with Marine A. He explained \nMarine A was one of three enlisted members of his battalion, including Sailor 1 and Sailor \n2, with whom he engaged in consensual sexual relationships. He described the \nrelationships with Marine A and Sailor 1 as casual, and with Sailor 2 as more than casual. \nHe estimated he began the three relationships between about January and June 2018, \nbut he did not indicate when they concluded. (GE 2 at 8, 9-10) \nApplicant denied the Article 134 charge (Charge II, Specification 2) involving \nfraternization with Marines B, which he explained resulted from an allegation that he \nshowed favoritism by giving them more awards or attention than he gave the other \nMarines he managed in his unit. He admitted he gave Marines B more responsibilities \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nbecause they were his hardest working Marines. However, he denied he showed them \nfavoritism or treated them differently. He admitted the Article 133 charge (Charge IV, \nSpecification 2) involving fraternization with Marines B, without further explanation. (GE \n2 at 3, 8, 9) \nApplicant denied the Article 92 and 133 charges (Charge III, Specification 3, 4; \nCharge IV, Specifications 4, 5) involving harassment and the use of inappropriate and \noffensive language. He denied he harassed anyone by engaging in conduct that was \neither unwelcome or based on sex or race. He denied he sexually harassed anyone. He \ndenied he used any inappropriate or offensive language in the presence of junior Marines, \nincluding racial slurs. He denied telling Marine F, \u201cdamn she is fine\u201d or \u201cI would hit that,\u201d \nor telling Marine G, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back to [Country 1] and have sex.\u201d (AE I; GE 2 at \n9) \nApplicant admitted he used racial jargon, such as the N-word, while joking around \nwith his friend, Marine D. However, he maintained he never used racial jargon, such as \nthe N-word, in a derogatory manner. He did not understand why anyone would allege he \nhad done so. He admitted he engaged in conversations of a sexual nature and exchanged \nsexual photos, consensually, with Marine C, which he acknowledged was inappropriate \nbecause she was a junior Marine. He admitted his platoon sergeant, Marine G, observed \nMarine A texting him, which Applicant acknowledged was against policy because she was \nlower in rank. (GE 2 at 2, 7-10) \nApplicant professed his belief that the sexual harassment charges were alleged \nbecause he engaged in sexual relationships with junior Marines over whom he exercised \na position of power. However, he denied his sexual relationships with Marine A, Sailor 1, \nand Sailor 2 constituted sexual harassment because they were consensual. There is no \nindication he addressed, during his 2020 interview, why he did not consider his admitted \ncommunications of a sexual nature with Marine C to constitute sexual harassment or \nwhat, if any, other specific allegations underlay the sexual harassment charges. (GE 2 at \n2, 7-10) \nApplicant attributed the preferred UCMJ charges to an Equal Opportunity (EO) \ncomplaint initiated by Sailor 1\u2019s boyfriend. Some months after Applicant and Sailor 1\u2019s \nrelationship ended, Applicant sent her a social media friend request. On the same day \nSailor 1 asked Applicant to withdraw the friend request because she had a boyfriend, \nSailor 1\u2019s boyfriend initiated the EO complaint for fraternization. Applicant acknowledged \nthat, during the investigation of the EO complaint, several Marines provided witness \nstatements alleging they observed him talk about sex in the presence of junior Marines, \nsexually harass and fraternize with junior Marines, and show favoritism to Marines B. He \nindicated Marines B proffered statements favorable to him, but Marine G did not. He \nstated Marine G had an interest in Marine A and did not like Applicant. (GE 2 at 2, 7-8) \nApplicant averred the investigation led to several false allegations against him, but \nhe did not elucidate further. He later opined the allegations were all opinion based. He \nthen asserted there were no real facts or evidence presented and the Commandant was \nnot able to hear both sides.

He claimed he did so without having \neither been informed of, or otherwise understanding, the possibility of an OTH; and, had \nhe known, he may have chosen a different path regarding the investigation and charges. \nHe engaged civilian counsel in about June 2020, to begin an unspecified appeal process. \n(GE 2 at 10)  \nApplicant attributed his knowing violation of USMC policy by fraternizing and \nhaving sexual relationships with junior Marines to the isolated nature of his duty station in \nCountry 1 and his limited access to female peers in the USMC. He professed his love for \nthe USMC. Upon declaring he took full responsibility for, and regretted, the decisions he \nmade, he asserted many of the UCMJ charges and allegations were false and unfounded, \nwithout explication. He characterized the circumstances of his discharge as an isolated \nincident, and not a pattern of behavior, which ruined his life. He acknowledged his family \nand friends looked at him differently and he was thoroughly embarrassed. He claimed he \nwas not susceptible to any potential influence, blackmail, or coercion regarding these \nissues. (GE 2 at 10) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant claimed the following about certain statements he \nmade during his 2020 interview: \n\u2022 When he made any statements about false or unfounded charges or \nallegations, he was referencing only the charges and allegations involving the \nArticle 120 and 128 charges involving abusive sexual contact, to which he did \nnot admit guilt. (GE 2 at 8, 10; Tr. at 177-178) \n\u2022 When he stated the allegations were all opinion based, he was referencing \n\u201chearsay\u201d he learned about Marine G during the investigation. He explained, \n\u201cone or more of his fellow Marines\u201d told him Marine G was soliciting individuals \nfrom their battalion to \u201cprovide negative testimony about me.\u201d (GE 2 at 10; Tr. \nat 186-187) \n\u2022 When he stated there were no real facts or evidence presented, he was \nreferencing that he did not make a statement during the investigation, upon the \nadvice of his military defense counsel. (GE 2 at 10; Tr. at 157-158) \n\u2022 When he made the statement indicating he had neither been informed of, nor \notherwise understood, the possibility of an OTH at the time he decided to \nsubmit his RFR, he was referencing that he was not expecting to receive an \nOTH when he submitted his RFR. He maintained, despite acknowledging the \npossibility of an OTH in his RFR, he did not believe he would receive an OTH \ndischarge because his military defense counsel left him with the impression he \nwould receive a General discharge. (GE 2 at 10; Tr. at 129-130, 158-160)   \nDuring the hearing, Applicant also explained he had not yet requested to upgrade \nhis OTH (the appeal process he referenced during his 2020 interview), due to financial \nconstraints.

He maintained, once \nhe was assigned to her platoon, they mutually agreed to cease communications of a \nsexual nature and move forward with a \u201cstrictly professional\u201d relationship.

(GE 2 at 8, 10; Tr. at 161, 178-185) \nSOR Allegations \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer and during the hearing, he oscillated between \nacknowledging responsibility for his admitted misconduct and attempting to minimize its \nscope and security significance.

Essentially I would flirt with these females as \nthough we were all civilians, and in most cases, the flirting was reciprocated. \nI did not know that some of my flirting was unwelcomed, and had I known \nthis, I would have stopped . . . I was also shocked to learn that [Marine D] \nwas offended by comments I had made routinely throughout the course of \nour friendship. I used [the N-word] in the same way you would emphasize \nyour closeness to another person. I never intended to use [the N-word] in a \nderogatory manner, and had I known that [Marine D] was uncomfortable \nwith this word, I would have immediately stopped using it and found another \nterm of endearment to use. I associate with people of all walks of life, and I \nhave realized that I sometimes adopt words or phrases that, while \nappropriate among certain groups, may not be acceptable in society as a \nwhole. (AE B; Tr. at 214-217) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant maintained he used the N-word only one time while \nin the USMC, during the conversation with Marine D referenced in his Answer \n(Conversation X). He claimed he did not recall using the N-word or any other racial slur \nat any other time while in the USMC. He asserted any phrasing used in his Answer \nsuggesting he used the N-word more than once was inadvertent and not meant as an \nadmission he used the N-word more than his one-time use during Conversation X. He \nattributed his one-time use of the N-word during Conversation X to his childhood \nexperiences. In the community in which he grew up, which he described as \u201cprimarily \nAfrican American\u201d and \u201cHispanic,\u201d use of the N-word \u201cwas normal . . . a term of \nbrotherhood or endearment or something that you say to a friend in certain conversations, \nit was appropriate.\u201d He acknowledged, \u201cit's not appropriate for me to carry that habit on. \nIt's not appropriate in . . . work settings. It's not appropriate in my private life because of \nthe nature of the word.\u201d On a DOD medical form, he reported his race as \u201cWhite.\u201d One or \nmore of his witnesses, current or former USMC members, testified that use of the N-word, \nin any fashion, would be inappropriate in any setting in the USMC, and would have a \nnegative impact on command climate if overheard by junior Marines.

(Tr. at 126-128) \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay, and creating a hostile work environment, \nyour understanding having gone through OCS, TBS, and yearly training is \npart of what is considered sexual harassment underneath [MCO 5354.1E], \ncorrect? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And that's why you admitted that you had \nengaged in sexual harassment as well, correct? \nAPPLICANT: I admitted to sexual harassment because I understand that \nindividuals did in fact take it in a manner that was harmful to them. I said \nwhat I said, and it wasn't with that intention, but I understand that people did \nreceive it in a way that was harmful to them and it caused them stress and, \nand pain, I presume. . . . (Tr. at 150-151) \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: . . . what was your reasoning in denying that \nyou'd sexually harassed anyone to the OPM investigator [during your 2020 \nInterview]? \nAPPLICANT: I gave that statement because, again, my intention when I had \nsaid what I said and engaged in the conversations I engaged in, there was \nno ill intention. I didn't ever mean to hurt anybody. I didn't mean to ever feel \nor make anyone feel as if they were, you know, getting victimized or \nsomething along those lines. Again, it's still inappropriate. And that's what \nagain, I was owning up to was the fact that yes, I said things that could have \nbeen, you know, depending on the audience and who heard it could have \nbeen . . . offended by it. . . . (Tr. at 153) \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: . . . why when talking to the OPM investigator \n[during your 2020 Interview], when you have already admitted guilt to the \nSecretary of the Navy, would you then deny that you had committed . . . \nsexual harassment? \nAPPLICANT: Because again, . . . I was admitting to . . . the use of the \nlanguage, and that isn't appropriate, and that . . . there was no intention, but \nit was still [in]appropriate language.

There [were] no incidents in my life \nprior to this. There have been no incidents in my life since this. The gravity \nand the weight of . . . losing . . . one of the greatest privileges that any person \ncan have, which is to serve [in the] Marines, carried a really heavy burden. \nLosing the respect of mentors and peers carried a heavy burden. \nFriendships, it carried a heavy burden.

(AE B at \n2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or.10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe concern under Guideline D is set out in AG \u00b6 12, as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about a person's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nNeither Applicant\u2019s admissions nor the record evidence establishes that the \nallegations regarding his use of a racial slur (SOR \u00b6 1.a) or his fraternization with Marines \nB (SOR \u00b6 1.b) involved sexual behavior. Accordingly, I find those parts of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand SOR 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor as relates to Guideline D. Nevertheless, they remain \nrelevant in evaluating Guidelines J and E, mitigation, and the whole-person concept. \nWith respect to the remaining allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the record evidence establish the following disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6 13 under Guideline D: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 14 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following warrant further discussion: \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nApplicant engaged in sexual behavior that was not only inappropriate, but also \ncriminal under Articles 92, 133, and 134, UCMJ. To avoid a court-martial conviction for \nserious offenses, he admitted engaging in sexual harassment and fraternization of a \nsexual nature involving 12 victims, including at least three enlisted female members of \nhis battalion. In his RFR and personal statement, he acknowledged wrongdoing and \naccepted responsibility for his admitted sexual behavior. Had the record ended there, he \nmight have been able to mitigate the security concerns. However, beginning with his 2020 \ninterview, he has incredulously attempted to distance himself from the culpability he \nacknowledged in his RFR and minimize the scope of his admitted sexual behavior. \nThe consensual nature of Applicant\u2019s sexual relationships with Marine A, Sailor 1, \nand Sailor 2 does not mitigate his flagrant violation of USMC policy. By the time he arrived \nin Country 1, he had been indoctrinated about the military\u2019s rules and policies concerning \nfraternization and sexual harassment, not only by virtue of his two years of enlisted \nexperience in the USCG, but also through the training he underwent upon commissioning \ninto the USMC. He demonstrated poor judgment and a lack of discretion by choosing to \nengage in those three sexual relationships, sharing graphic details about his sexual \nrelationship with Marine A, and using inappropriate and offensive language of a sexual \nnature in the presence of junior Marines and Sailors. Despite his attempt to downplay his \nadmitted sexual behavior as largely benign flirting, I conclude he engaged in inappropriate \nsexual behavior that created an intimidating, hostile, and abusive working environment. \nAs an officer in the USMC, Applicant\u2019s admitted sexual behavior was egregious, \nparticularly given its impact on individuals subordinate to him. His inconsistent statements \nand equivocating throughout the security clearance process damaged his credibility and \nundermined mitigation. Moreover, his admitted sexual behavior demonstrates a \nwillingness to prioritize his own self-interest above his obligations, which casts doubt as \nto whether he may also act similarly in the context of his security obligations. Considering \nthe record as a whole, I am left with doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b), 14(c), and 14(d) are not established. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under Guideline J is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Nevertheless, his OTH remains relevant in evaluating Guideline E, \nmitigation, and the whole-person concept. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under Guideline J, I find the following warrant discussion: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline D, Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns raised by his admitted sexual behavior, which violated Articles 92, 133, and \n134, UCMJ. He engaged in unwelcome and offensive conduct, based on race, which \ncreated an intimidating, hostile, and abusive working environment, in violation of Article \n92, UCMJ. He fraternized with Marines B in violation of Articles 133 and 134, UCMJ. He \nused the N-word in the presence of six enlisted Marines in violation of Article 133, UCMJ. \nApplicant\u2019s violation of the USMC fraternalization policy by engaging in unduly \nfamiliar relationships with Marines B is not any less security significant because it did not \ninvolve conduct of a sexual nature. I have doubts as to whether he used the N-word on \nonly one occasion while in the USMC. Nonetheless, particularly as an officer, it was \ninappropriate for him to use the N-word even one time, regardless of his intent or whether \nMarine D was personally offended. \nApplicant did not meet his burden to rebut the substantial evidence of his UCMJ \nviolations to which he admitted guilt in his RFR. His OTH, which was endorsed by his \nchain of command, underscores the significance and gravity of his admitted sexual \n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavior and other admitted misconduct. I considered the time passed without recidivism \nand the efforts Applicant made to avoid repeating the admitted misconduct underlying his \nOTH. However, given his failure to unequivocally accept responsibility and acknowledge \nwrongdoing for his admitted misconduct, I am left with doubts about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under Guideline E is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged Applicant\u2019s OTH and the following facts about the UCMJ \ncharges underlying his OTH: \u201cArticle 134 (Fraternization) 3 times, Article 92 (Failure to \nObey) 4 times, and Article 133 (Unbecoming of an Officer).\u201d Because the \u201c3 times\u201d and \n\u201c4 times\u201d language was not established by either Applicant\u2019s admissions or the record \nevidence, I find that part of SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWith respect to the remaining allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a, I have considered all the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 under Guideline E. I find the following warrant \ndiscussion: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline \n. . .  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations \n. . . ; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

His OTH is not independently \ndisqualifying under Guideline E because it is a consequence of his admitted misconduct, \nnot the misconduct itself. The admitted misconduct underlying Applicant\u2019s OTH was \nexplicitly covered by the allegations in Guidelines D and J, which were found against \nApplicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not established. Despite my adverse determinations \nunder Guidelines D and J, the admitted misconduct underlying Applicant\u2019s OTH raises \nindependent security concerns under Guideline E. AG \u00b6 16(e) is established. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under Guideline E, I find the following warrant discussion: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nIncorporating my comments under Guidelines D and J, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) nor \n17(d) are established as to the admitted misconduct underlying Applicant\u2019s OTH. \nApplicant made disclosures about his admitted misconduct to family, friends, and to his \ncurrent and former coworkers and superiors. However, the record did not sufficiently \nestablish that he divulged to them the full nature and extent of his specific actions. \nMoreover, throughout the security clearance process, he attempted to minimize the scope \nof, and failed to accept full responsibility for, his admitted misconduct. Therefore, I am left \nwith doubts and ongoing concerns about his susceptibility to exploitation, manipulation, \nor duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, E, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered all the \nevidence and arguments proffered by Applicant in support of mitigation, the occasions he \nacknowledged wrongdoing and professed remorse for his admitted misconduct, the \ncounseling and other efforts he undertook to understand and reform his behavior, and the \nfavorable testimony of his witnesses. The toxic culture of his leadership and duty station \nin Country 1, his negative experiences with his USCG leadership, and his upbringing \nundoubtedly played a role in Applicant\u2019s admitted misconduct and poor decisions. \nHowever, these factors do not mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns. Beginning with his \n2020 interview and continuing through the hearing, Applicant undermined his credibility \nand mitigation through his inconsistent statements, equivocations, and minimization. \nApplicant and his witnesses touted the accountability he took for his admitted \nmisconduct. Had the record ended with the level of accountability he professed in his RFR \nand accompanying personal statement, it might have been a closer case. However, this \nis not a close case. He appeared sincere in his resolve to avoid repeating the misconduct \nand poor judgment underlying his OTH. He is commended for his efforts toward personal \nand professional growth. However, he failed to unequivocally accept responsibility or \ndemonstrate that he grasped the gravity of his admitted misconduct. Moreover, his \nattempts to distance himself from the culpability he acknowledged in his RFR and to \nminimize the scope of his admitted misconduct raise doubts about the extent to which he \nhas truly evolved. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for an award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. However, based on the evidence before me, I am unable to conclude that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines D, E, and J and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his sexual \nbehavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant his eligibility for access to classified information. \n25 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the part \nregarding his use of a racial slur, which I \nfind for Applicant) \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the part \nregarding his fraternization with Marines \nB, which I find for Applicant) \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \u201c3 \ntimes\u201d and \u201c4 times\u201d part, which I find for \nApplicant) \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 47 years old. She married in 1995 and divorced her first husband in \n2001. She remarried in 2004 and divorced her second husband in 2016. She has three \nchildren; one who is adopted and is a minor. She served in the U.S Navy from 2004-2016 \nand received an honorable discharge. She has been working for a defense contractor \nsince 2018 as an aircraft mechanic. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in 2012. Her children were living with her ex-\nhusband, and she found out that they were being physically abused by him and his wife. \nShe was an E-4 in the Navy, on a tight budget, and had to hire an attorney to obtain \ncustody. The Navy did not provide her with legal representation. She took out several \nloans to pay her attorney and repaid them through allotments from her military paycheck. \n(Tr. 22-28; AE G, H) \nApplicant incurred other expenses after getting custody of her children. She had \nto rent a larger home and had new household expenses. After repaying the initial loans \nshe took for legal fees, she took new loans (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g) to help her cover new \nhousehold expenses. She repaid these loans by allotment from her military paycheck, \nuntil she left the Navy in 2016. She was unemployed from about April 2016-January 2018 \nand was unable to make payments on these loans. (Tr. 22-35) \nSince 2018, Applicant has had five surgeries which have resulted in about $15,000 \nof out-of-pocket expenses, and had reduced disability pay for about a year, lowering her \nincome by 40%. In about 2018, she had to hire another attorney to adopt her \ngranddaughter, who was being neglected. She spent about $20,000 on these legal \nexpenses, which she paid from her monthly income. (Tr. 22-35) \nDespite these unexpected expenses, Applicant has tried to make payments to \ncreditors and resolve smaller debts, while planning to address the larger debts when her \nfinancial circumstances stabilized. She has been unable to make payments or \narrangements at times of reduced income, such as while on disability after surgery. She \nhas been able to pay her regular monthly expenses despite the strains on her finances. \nShe lives with and supports her adult daughter, minor granddaughter, and her minor \nadopted daughter. (Tr. 22-35) \nWhen starting her job in 2018, Applicant made about $72,000 yearly. She now \nmakes about $93,000 yearly. She follows a budget, and it shows that she is able to \nmaintain her monthly expenses and make debt payments, including at least four of the \ndebts alleged. She has about $3,000 left over monthly. She stated that she does not owe \nany money to the government for taxes, but she did not timely file her 2022 state income \ntaxes, which was not alleged in the SOR.

She claimed the original \ndebt was much smaller, and the current amount is largely late fees. She contacted the \ncreditor after receiving the SOR. She had set up a payment plan for $50 monthly but was \nunable to continue after going on short term disability after surgery. She has budgeted to \nmake $100 monthly payments on this debt.

(Tr.; AE B; GE 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges that in 2016 Applicant took cash advances from her government \ncredit card for personal use while serving in the Navy. She stated that in 2016, while on \nterminal leave from the Navy, her teenage son\u2019s child was born. Her son was unable to \nprovide support for the baby. She used her government travel credit card to pay her \nelectric bill and a few other emergency personal expenses, until she received her \npaycheck. Taking out funds for these types of expenses was not permitted on government \ntravel cards. She stated that she oversaw her unit\u2019s travel credit card program and knew \nthat other service members in her unit had taken out funds for these kinds of expenses. \nShe stated that as long as the credit card payments were made on time, it was not a \ndisciplinary issue. She paid her bill on time but was counseled by her commander while \non terminal leave. She asserted that she understood that she made a mistake and was \nremorseful for this misuse. (Tr. 35-38; GE 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems result from circumstances beyond her control, \nincluding two different legal battles to obtain custody of her two biological children, and \nlater her granddaughter. Her financial difficulties also resulted from unemployment after \nleaving the military, reduced pay while on disability, and out-of-pocket expenses after five \nsurgeries between 2018-2023. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.k are resolved. She has contacted \ncreditors to make payment arrangements for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j. \nWhile not all of Applicant\u2019s debts are resolved, she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and has a plan to address her financial delinquencies. She has taken \nsubstantial steps to repay her debts, even though at times her ability to do so was \ninterrupted by medical expenses and reduced income due to disability. \nThe alleged misuse of her government credit occurred seven years ago, was a \none-time circumstance, and is unlikely to recur. She admitted her mistake, explained the \nexigent circumstances about why she misused it, and expressed remorse. This incident \ndoes not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant incurred significant financial injury to ensure the safety and wellbeing of \nher two children and obtain custody. Six years later she did the same for her \ngranddaughter by adopting her. She continues to support three persons (her adopted \ngranddaughter, her adult daughter, and granddaughter) in her home, and maintains her \nregular everyday finances and household. Looking at these circumstances, she has not \nbeen financially irresponsible, rather her behavior has been reliable, trustworthy and she \nhas exhibited good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered her military service and character letters. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. She mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. Eligibility for access to sensitive information \nis granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He would do so in a stall and watching \npornographic videos on his phone. According to the interview, Applicant also admitted \nto masturbating in other locations, including at friends\u2019 homes and outside. He did not \nmake any corrections to these statements in the interview summary. However, at the \nhearing, he testified that he could not recall making those statements. (Tr. 82, 85-90, \n103-105, 107-110, 124; GE 2) \nApplicant also told the investigator that he took pictures and recorded video of his \nthen wife while she was showering or changing in their bedroom, without her consent or \nknowledge. He confessed the conduct to her in 2018 during a period of martial difficulty. \nHe admitted that she felt violated by his actions. The couple divorced in December 2020 \nafter eight years of marriage. These incidents occurred in State 1, where he lived from \n2012 to 2020. (Tr. 86, 113-115, 136; GE 1-2) \nIn 2018, Applicant believed his viewing of pornography and masturbation was \ncreating problems in his personal life. He believed his actions constituted a sex \naddiction, and he sought counseling from a faith-based counseling service (CS1). It is \nunclear from the record how long he received treatment from CS1. In October 2018, he \nbegan receiving faith-based counseling at counseling service 2 (CS2) from a licensed \nprofessional counselor (LPC) who is also a certified clinical sexual addiction specialist. \nHe attended sessions at CS2 until March 2022. Applicant did not submit the curriculum \nvitae for either practitioner at CS1 or CS2. He did not provide diagnostic information, a \nprognosis, or treatment records from CS1 or CS2. Applicant claims that neither \npractitioner at CS1 or CS2 gave him a diagnosis related to hypersexualized or addictive \nbehaviors. (Tr. 31-4, 133; GE 2-3; AE A) \nThe counselor from CS1 referred Applicant to a faith-based ministry program \ndedicated to \u201csexual integrity\u201d and helping people stop unwanted sexual behavior. \nApplicant referred to the all-male group as a \u201csexual accountability group.\u201d One of the \ntenets of this program is that sexual contact should only occur between a husband and \nwife. Masturbation and use of pornography are some of the sexual acts that constitute \nthe unwanted sexual behavior the program seeks to stop. Applicant testified that the \ngroup followed a 12-step program model like Alcoholics Anonymous. His accountability \ngroup was led by an ordained pastor, who is not a licensed therapist or mental health \nprofessional. The pastor became a certified Professional Sex Addiction Pastor through \nthe International Institute of Trauma and Addiction Professionals in 2020. The pastor is \nalso a retired military officer, who held a security clearance during his service. (Tr. 95-\n69, 110, 123-133; GE 2-3; Answer) \nAccording to the May 2022 letter prepared by the pastor in support of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant attended the accountability group from August \n2018 to November 2020. The pastor described Applicant as being well-respected by the \nother men in the group. He believed that Applicant was open and honest about his past \nbehaviors and displayed a profound willingness to heal from unspecified past wounds. \n(Answer, Tab D) The letter states, in part: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his time in group, [Applicant] reported that he did not engage in any \nsexually inappropriate or otherwise compromising conduct with any \nperson. . . He also reports having not engaged in any activity that might be \nconstrued as public masturbation since November 2020. (Answer, Tab D) \nApplicant acknowledged that he engaged in illegal behavior by masturbating in \npublic and taking photographs and videos of his then wife\u2019s permission. He explained \nthat he used masturbation to complete his stress cycle and deal with difficult emotions. \nHe testified that in counseling he learned to identify his emotions as they arise and to \nidentify his triggers in an effort to control his impulsive behavior. (Tr. 85, 105, 126-130, \n135-138) \nFour witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Each is aware of Applicant\u2019s past \nbehavior. Each still considered Applicant trustworthy and of good character, and \nconsidered him a suitable candidate for continued access for classified information. \n(Tr.14-77) \nApplicant believes he is managing his issues. He began attending the \naccountability group again in April 2023, attending virtually 3 to 4 times per week. He \nexplained that the stress associated with the security clearance process prompted him \nto return. Even though Applicant participates in the sexual accountability group, he \ncontinues to view pornography and masturbate in contravention of the group\u2019s \nphilosophy. He also relies on another group member for one-on-one support when \nneeded. (Tr. 96, 130-131, 133, 141) \nHe does not believe that his conduct is a potential source of vulnerability \nbecause he has disclosed the behavior to close family members, friends, and a former \ngirlfriend. (Tr. 98-88, 122) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nSexual behavior, which includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission, raises a concern when it involves a criminal offense; \nreflects a lack of judgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence \nof coercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Based on Applicant\u2019s admissions, the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 13 (a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted;  \nAG \u00b6 13 (b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop;  \nAG \u00b6 13(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions available under the sexual behavior \nguideline, I find that none apply. Applicant began engaging in criminal conduct of a \nsexual nature as an adult. Though he was never arrested or charged, Applicant \nengaged in escalating sexual criminal conduct over the course of 15 years. He \nperformed a sex act in public spaces to include his car, his job, outside, and at friends\u2019 \nhomes. (See, HE II, State 1 statute regarding sexual misconduct). He also violated his \nex-wife\u2019s right to privacy by capturing nude images of her without her consent. (See, HE \nIII, State 1 statute regarding invasion of privacy) \nThis conduct cannot be considered minor or victimless. The four years that he \nhas not engaged in the conduct is not enough time to mitigate his 15-year history of \nmisconduct. Furthermore, there is not sufficient evidence in the record to support a \nfinding that Applicant has engaged in an appropriate program of treatment to address \nhis behavior. Based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, his actions were the result of his inability \nto cope with stress and difficult emotional issues. Both are elements of the human \ncondition that are likely to recur. His claims that he has learned how to better process \nhis emotions and identify his triggers are not corroborated by the record, which does not \ncontain a diagnosis, treatment notes, or prognosis from a qualified mental health \nprofessional. In this case, Applicant has essentially made a promise not to engage in \nsimilar conduct in the future. However, given the severity of his underlying conduct, \nneither his promise nor the favorable character evidence in the record is enough to \nmitigate the security concern. \nApplicant\u2019s promise is insufficient in that he is not in compliance with the behavior \naccountability program of his choosing. Since at least August 2018, he has voluntarily \nchosen to participate in a sexual accountability group that follows a 12-step program, \nwhich typically provides guiding principles that outline how to overcome addiction and \navoid triggers. The sexual accountability group that he chose teaches abstinence from \nmasturbation and use of pornography. He admits that he continues to engage in both \nactivities. He also believes that he currently requires the support of the group and his \naccountability partner to help him manage his behavior. \nApplicant sought help with these behaviors specifically because he believed they \nrose to the level of an addiction \u2013 indicating that he could not control or limit how or \nwhen he engaged in them. He recognized that both behaviors, which many can engage \nin without issue, constitute a problem for him. His decision to engage in the behaviors \nagain are akin to a relapse. As such, it is possible that Applicant could find himself in a \nposition where he is unable to self-regulate his behavior in the future, resulting in the \nrecurrence of the conduct alleged in the SOR. \nWhole Person Concept   \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness.

Although Applicant has been candid with the Government \nabout his conduct, that does not mitigate the alleged security concerns. All applicants \nare expected to provide full, frank, and candid disclosure to the Government at all times \nduring the adjudicative process. Applicant engaged in serious misconduct. He did not \nmeet his burden of proof or persuasion to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \n15-year history of sexual misconduct. The record does not contain sufficient information \nthat Applicant has received appropriate treatment for the issues or that he has engaged \nin sufficient treatment to address the underlying issues that manifested in the alleged \nmisconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Sexual Behavior \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The United States established diplomatic relations \nwith Armenia in 1992. \nFollowing independence, Armenia has been involved in multiple conflicts over the \nyears with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The \nconflict increased significantly in 2020 and there were reports that Azerbaijani forces \nengaged in unlawful killings and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of Armenian \nforces during that time. A ceasefire arrangement was reached in November 2020. \nHowever, in September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive reasserting \ncontrol in the region. The United Stated has issued calls for an end to hostilities and \nunhindered humanitarian access in the region.

The \nU.S. role in Armenia has become more important as regional tensions increase \nfollowing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \nThe Russian Federation \nThe Russian Federation has a highly centralized authoritarian political system \ndominated by President Vladimir Putin. Russia presents one of the most serious foreign \nthreats to the United States and has attempted to position itself as a great power \ncompetitor to the United States by undermining norms within the existing international \nsystem. \nIn February 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, claiming the area to be part of the \nRussian Federation. In September 2022, Russia occupied four more provinces in \nUkraine, and in February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a \nresult, the United States issued numerous sanctions against Russian citizens and has \nprovided aid to Ukraine. DOS issued \u201cLevel 4 - Do not travel\u201d warnings, for both \ncountries. \nRussia also remains a top cyber threat as it refines and employs its espionage, \ninfluence, and attack capabilities. Russia views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy \nlever to shape countries\u2019 decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool. Russia \nremains a hostile country to the interests of the United States. See ISCR Case No. 19-\n00831 at 3 (App. Bd. July 29, 2020). Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine is ongoing.  \nUkraine \nThe only allegation concerning Applicant\u2019s connections to Ukraine that make the \nfacts contained in AN III relevant here is SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant\u2019s aunt who lived in \nUkraine and passed away in 2020. Given the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia \n(see discussion above), there is an obvious foreign influence security concern involving \nUkraine generally. However, Applicant has no current or recent connections to Ukraine \nto suggest an ongoing security concern related to him. Therefore, I will not expand on \nthe facts contained in AN III about Ukraine. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nclassified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or classified information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned of foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding [classified] information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. It \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of \nApplicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country as well as each individual tie must be considered. \nAdditionally, \u201cthe nature of the foreign government involved and the intelligence-\ngathering history of the government are among the important considerations that \nprovide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another \nimportant consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018). \nWith regard to Armenia, all of the above security concerns are established. \nApplicant maintains minimal contact with a distant family member and numerous friends \nwho are citizens or residents of Armenia. These contacts include persons who work \nwithin or in support of the Armenian government. Applicant also continues to co-own a \nproperty in Armenia with an estimated value of $70,000. These connections to Armenia \nare sufficient to raise a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with persons who are citizens or residents of Russia is \nsignificantly less. Nonetheless, Russia is a hostile country to the United States. Given \nthe relationship between Russia and the United States, as established in AN II, \nApplicant\u2019s connections are sufficient to raise a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established with regard to Applicant\u2019s contacts in Russia. \nWith the passing of his aunt, Applicant no longer has any connections to Ukraine. \nNone of the security concerns are established with regard to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under Guideline \nB, including the following which are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Armenia and Russia via his \ndistant family members and multiple friendships. In particular, Russia\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States, and the heightened risk it presents, place a very heavy burden on \nApplicant to mitigate the security concern. ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd., \nAug. 7, 2019) With that said, Applicant presented as very serious, candid and credible \nat hearing. He appears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful information during \nthe security clearance process and during his background interview. \nApplicant maintains contact with distant family members and numerous friends in \nArmenia. The contact with these individuals is minimal, primarily relating to greetings \nduring holidays and birthdays. He also continues to co-own a property in Armenia with \nhis parents. His contacts with individuals who have any association with Russia are also \nminimal and generally only include holiday and birthday greetings. Applicant has not \nspoken with his one friend that works on a Russian base in Armenia in two years. \nComparatively, Applicant has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the United States. His wife, two children, parents, sister and mother-in-law are all \ncitizens and residents of the United States. Applicant owns property and is financially \ninvested in the United States. He is trusted in his employment and is an involved \nmember of his community. \nRecently, Applicant\u2019s ties to Armenia have further decreased. In April 2022, he \nrenounced his Armenian citizenship. Later that year, he sold one of his two properties in \nArmenia. I find that it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of the Armenian or Russian \ngovernments or his relationship with individuals residing in Armenia or Russia. I further \nfind there is no conflict of interest as he has shown that his relationships and loyalties \nare in the United States, and that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the United States. All of the above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nFollowing his move to the United States in 2010, Applicant spent several years \nworking as a government contractor and serving the interests of the United States. \nNumerous character references and awards reflect his commitment to his work and \ncommunity. Once he, his wife and children obtained U.S. citizenship, he sponsored his \nparents\u2019 move to the United States. They, along with his sister and mother-in-law, are \nnow U.S. citizens. Applicant has since sold one of his properties in Armenia and \nrenounced his Armenian citizenship. \nI also had the opportunity to observe Applicant's demeanor during his hearing \nand found that he was credible and candid. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the \npleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of \nfact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. Since 2021 he has worked overseas as a civil \nengineer and functional manager for a government contractor. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1) \nApplicant was born in Iraq and lived there until he was about 30 years old. After \ncompleting college in Iraq in 2005, he worked for an Iraqi company in the construction \nindustry. In 2008, he started working for a construction company that serviced coalition \nmilitary bases in Iraq. In 2010, he was threatened twice by unknown persons for working \non coalition bases, and had to take safety precautions. In 2012, he was granted a special \nimmigrant visa (SIV) for his work on coalition bases, and he immigrated to the United \nStates. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 2019. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1) \nFrom 2012 \u2013 2018, Applicant worked for construction companies that sent him on \nassignments in various overseas locations, including Iraq, for varying amounts of time. \nHe reported that these assignments usually lasted less than six months at a time. He \nworked in the U.S. from about 2018 \u2013 2021, and then took a job overseas in the Middle \nEast, where he continues to live and work. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant does not own a home or have a lease for a rental property in the United \nStates. He asserted that he thinks of U.S. State A as home and has a driver\u2019s license \nfrom there. The license lists the address of a friend from whom Applicant claims to rent a \nroom on occasion, when visiting the United States. However, in his testimony at the \nhearing, Applicant did not know the last name of this friend. Applicant does not have many \npersons in the United States with whom he maintains close and continuing contact. He \nhas a U.S. bank account and a 401K retirement account, neither of which contains more \nthan $20,000. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings, and their immediate families, are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. Four siblings have jobs that are connected to the Iraqi government. In \nhis SCA, Applicant reported regular and frequent contact with almost all of these \nimmediate family members.

(Tr. 15-58; Answer) \nIn his answer, Applicant included four character letters which state that he is a \nvalued employee, reliable, trustworthy, and fit to hold a security clearance. (Answer) \nIraq \nIn AN 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of September 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Iraq and the current \nconditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: \nDo not travel\u201d location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and limited \nability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence \nand kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces \nand civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies \nthroughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas \nof the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. \nThese events can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, \ntransportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent. The \ntravel warning as of the date of this decision remains the same. \nThe country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and several Shia-\nmajority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through mid-2020, with reports of more\nthan 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. During the year sporadic protests\ncontinued amid a campaign of targeted violence against activists. The government took \nminimal steps to bring to justice those responsible for the violence.\n \n \n \n \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking \nU.S. citizens abroad. Primary terrorist threats within Iraq included Islamic State in Iraq\nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups. ISIS is a designated terrorist\norganization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated\nterrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite\nimproved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. \ncitizens for attacks and hostage-taking.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible reports \nof unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances by the \ngovernment; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the government; \nand arbitrary arrest and detention. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and foreign contacts are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nA heightened security risk in Iraq is established by the administratively noticed \nfacts in the record. The security risks include the risk of terrorism and the human-rights \nrecords of this country. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings, with whom he maintains close and continuing \ncontact, are citizens and residents of Iraq, and four siblings have jobs that are connected \nto the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s longstanding connection to Iraq presents a conflict of \ninterest.

The record evidence demonstrates \nthat the home is owned by his mother, and that his sister stands to inherit it. SOR \u00b6 1.h is \ntherefore found for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant has several immediate family members remaining in Iraq, with whom he \nmaintains close and frequent contact. Iraq remains a heightened risk country. Applicant \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that there is no conflict of \ninterest between his sense of loyalty or obligation to his foreign contacts, his allegiance \nand connection to Iraq is minimal, and that he has deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S. that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the U.S. interest. Even though Applicant earned a SIV to come to United States, \nhe has longstanding personal and familial connections to Iraq. He spent three quarters of \nhis life in Iraq, and after immigrating to the United States, he has spent a significant \namount of time living and working overseas, including in Iraq. Further, his ties to the U.S. \nare comparatively limited. He owns no real property here. He recalled few details about \nhis connections to the U.S. On balance, he did not provide sufficient evidence that AG \u00b6 \n8(b) should apply to mitigate the security concerns established by his family members in \nIraq. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that his contact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.

His temporary limitation of \ncommunications with his family members during the processing of his security clearance \ndoes not alleviate these concerns. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline B arising from his foreign contacts and \nconnections to Iraq. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on April 28, \n2023. On June 14, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that his hearing was scheduled for July 7, 2023. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled via video conference. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified, and I admitted into evidence Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, without objection. I appended a transmittal letter and the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II, respectively. At \nApplicant\u2019s request, I left the record open until August 4, 2023, to allow him the opportunity \nto submit evidentiary documents. He timely provided documents that I admitted into \nevidence collectively as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on July 18, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 36, married his current wife in January 2022. He was married to his \nfirst wife from 2013 through 2017. They separated when she was about four months \npregnant with their now eight-year-old child, and remained separated for about two years \nbefore their divorce was finalized in January 2017. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2017, and a master\u2019s degree in 2019, both in information technology. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Air Force from 2006 through May 2017, when he was honorably \ndischarged and transitioned to the inactive reserves.

He began working for \nhis current sponsor since about December 2021 or January 2022. He has maintained a \nDOD security clearance since 2006, during which time he completed three EQIPs, \nincluding his most recent 2020 EQIP. (GE 1; GE 3 at 11; AE E; Tr. at 7, 33, 76-77, 79, \n84, 94) \nWhile on active duty, Applicant was stationed overseas twice: Country A from \nAugust 2007 to August 2009; and Country B from August 2009 to August 2012.

(GE 1; GE 3 at \n10, 13; Tr. at 147) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) intentionally falsified his \n2020 EQIP by failing to disclose relevant facts about his disciplinary record in the military \nand involvement with foreign nationals (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c), and (2) solicited a prostitute \nwhile traveling overseas in about late 2019 or 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).

(Tr. at 9-10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \nOn his 2020 EQIP, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to two questions asking about his \ndisciplinary record in the military. He did not otherwise disclose that he was subject to \nnonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) \nin January 2017 (Article 15), for misconduct involving missing equipment. (GE 1) \nDuring his March 2021 security clearance interview (2021 SI), Applicant initially \naffirmed that he had not been subject to court marital or other disciplinary procedure under \nthe UCMJ. After confrontation, he acknowledged the Article 15. He claimed that he did \nnot disclose the Article 15 on his 2020 EQIP because he thought it fell outside of the \nreportable seven-year period. He denied any wrongdoing with respect to the misconduct \nfor which he received the Article 15. He claimed that he was made to take the blame for \nthe missing equipment even though it was already missing when he took over the position \nof inventory custodian. He maintained that he agreed to accept punishment because he \nwas in the process of leaving the military at the time. He stated that he elected the Article \n15 for the benefit of an early separation, after being offered two punishment options: (1) \na letter of reprimand (LOR) and an honorable discharge in one year; or (2) the Article 15 \nand an honorable discharge in four months. In his Answer, he stated that he was \u201cthe \n[unit\u2019s] scape goat\u201d and \u201cwas not educated enough with military UCMJ policy to avoid \n[punishment].\u201d (GE 3 at 11-12) \nAt the hearing, Applicant maintained that he initially tried \u201cto fight\u201d the punishment, \nbut then agreed to accept it because he was \u201cready to get out of the military\u201d after learning \nthat he could earn more money as a defense contractor. He stated that he was told that \naccepting punishment would afford him the opportunity for an early separation with an \nhonorable discharge. He explained that he had reenlisted for another five years in 2016. \nHe was neither asked, nor did he address, why he reported on his 2020 EQIP \u201cenlistment \nended\u201d as his reason for leaving active duty. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. at 36, 40-42, 113, 145) \nBeginning with his Answer and continuing through the hearing, Applicant denied \nthat he intentionally omitted the Article 15 from his 2020 EQIP and during his 2021 SI. He \naddressed his 2021 SI omission as follows, \nIt took me a second to remember the incident . . . I was not hiding the Article \n15, I simply forgot about it since it had been over 4 years since I left active \nduty. (Answer) \nI simply forgot about the Article 15 . . . Once I fully separated from the \nmilitary, everything about the military life I had I did not sit around and think \nabout it all the time . . . My concern was never to remember how I exited the \nmilitary. That\u2019s why when the investigator asked me about it, I remembered \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nit, but initially I didn\u2019t . . . The last thing on my mind was an Article 15. (FORM \nresponse) \nI was talking to the [DOD investigator], she asked me if I had judicial \npunishment, and I was like I don't think I've had judicial punishment before. \nAnd then she said you had an Article 15, and I was like yes, I had an Article \n15. And she said well, that's judicial punishment, and I was like oh okay. I \nwasn't trying to hide the fact that I had an Article 15, I honestly just forgot in \nthe moment. (Answer; GE 8; Tr. at 22) \nApplicant initially testified about his 2020 EQIP omission as follows, \nWhen I was going through my [2020 EQIP], and I was just writing answers, \nand answering everything, it asked me about it, and I said no simply \nbecause I didn't remember. I got out [of] the military, I don't know, seven, \neight years ago. When I saw the question I just marked no, because I was \nlike no, I didn't get any action from the UCMJ. I didn't think about it at the \nmoment. I wasn't saying no because I didn't have it if that makes sense. I \nwas just saying no because I honestly didn't remember. I don't have any \nother explanation for that, I just didn't remember in the moment. (Tr. at 22-\n23) \nUpon cross examination, Applicant reiterated that he answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestions on his 2020 EQIP that asked about his disciplinary record because he \u201cjust \nhonestly didn\u2019t remember.\u201d He then stated that, when he agreed to accept punishment \nfor the missing equipment, he believed that he would only be receiving LORs. He claimed \nthat he did not know about the Article 15 until some months after he separated from the \nmilitary. Then, he had the following exchange with Department Counsel: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So, once again then, why didn't you disclose \nthat Article 15 in the [2020 EQIP]? \nAPPLICANT: When I [completed the 2020 EQIP] I simply just forgot.

He claimed that he did list them on \nthe 2020 EQIP because he misunderstood the question. He stated that only Friend X \nknew about either relationship. He maintained that he was not required to report foreign \ncontacts to his employer. About the Country E national, he stated: (1) she resided in \nCountry A and worked as a stripper at a local strip club; (2) he first met her in early 2020 \nthrough a friend who worked with her at the club; and (3) he maintained daily contact with \nher, both in person and by telephone. About the Country F national, he stated: (1) during \ntheir relationship, she resided in Country C and worked as a cook at a hotel; (2) he first \nmet her in 2018 via an online dating application; (3) they dated for eight months; (4) they \nlast had contact one or two years ago; and (5) he did not expect to have future contact \nwith her.

He reported his first and last dates of contact with the Country F national as March \n2018, and March 2019, respectively. (HE II; GE 3 at 2, 4) \nBeginning with his Answer and continuing through the hearing, Applicant denied \nthat he intentionally omitted his current wife and the Country F national from his 2020 \nEQIP. In his Answer, he stated, \nInitially on the [2020 EQIP] I answered the question the way I did, because \nI didn\u2019t think that non-cohabited, small relationships overseas would apply \nto that question. Being overseas, I was dating primarily foreign [women], but \nit was just dating and nothing serious until I came to [Country A] and found \n[my current wife]. But again, I was not hiding this information and will gladly \nadmit to dating while overseas.

At the time of the \n[2020 EQIP] Yes I had [known my current wife] for a year. However, I was \nnot supporting her for the entire time. So when the [2020 EQIP] asked me \nif I considered her as a foreign contact, my answer [was] no. At that time \nshe was just a young pretty girl I was interested in. We were not in a full \nrelationship for a year. I only said a year as a guess, because I didn\u2019t want \nthe investigator to try to make it seem like it was [a] different situation. \nAt the hearing, Applicant proffered the following reasons to explain why, at the time \nhe completed his 2020 EQIP, he did not consider either his current wife or the Country F \nnational to be reportable foreign contacts: (1) when he read the 2020 EQIP question, he \ndid not understand how the government defined \u201cclose and/or continuing contact with a \nforeign national\u201d and had not read the words \u201cbound by affection;\u201d (Tr. at 53-57); (2) at \nthe time he completed the 2020 EQIP, he was not in a \u201csolid relationship\u201d with his current \nwife and was not living with her (Tr. at 55, 56); and (3) he was \u201cjust dating\u201d the Country F \nnational and was never in a relationship with her. (Tr. at 61, 118) He also stated, \nAgain, at the time, to be honest, I did not know what a foreign contact was. \nI thought it was like -- I'm not going to say I didn't know what it was, I know \nwhat a foreign contact is, but I didn't think it was just like girls that you had \nrelations with. (Tr. at 23) \nI didn't know it was like hey, if you touched this girl, or if you had a \nconversation with this girl, or something like that. I don't know where the line \nof foreign contact is with a female. I mean if you meet one night, you do \nsomething, and then you don't talk to her again, I don't even know how that \ngoes. (Tr. at 23) \nAnd as far as my current wife, I was just dating her. . . We would go weeks \nand weeks -- not weeks, we would go days, or a week maybe without talking \nto each other. . . it was not like we are together and she was my girlfriend. \nIt was nothing like that for a while, for a very long time. . . So, again, like I \ndidn't know at that time, just on and off dating meant foreign contact. I \nhonestly just didn't know that's what it meant. I apologize, but I didn't know. \n(Tr. at 23-24) \nSo, when I filled this out . . . I not like in a solid relationship with [my current \nwife]. I was still trying to get her to be in a relationship with me. I mean, I'm \nnot going to say that, I was pursuing her, I guess, and we were dating.\u201d (Tr. \nat 56) \nI didn't know much about being with a girl from a third world country. The \nonly other foreign person that I had dated before was [the Kenyan national], \nbut she wasn't -- I wasn't dating, that was just me kind of having relations, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand then it wasn't -- I wasn't in relationships like that.

(Tr. at 56-57) \nUpon cross examination, Applicant acknowledged that he had undergone security \ntraining about foreign contacts. However, he claimed his training did not indicate to him \nthat either his current wife or the Country F national were reportable close and continuing \ncontacts on his 2020 EQIP. He maintained that he did not realize that they were reportable \nuntil the point in the hearing when he re-read the 2020 EQIP and then understood the \nmeaning of \u201cbound by affection.\u201d By the end of the hearing, he professed an \nunderstanding of his security obligations with respect to reporting contact with foreign \nnationals. (Tr. at 54-55, 61, 119-120, 129-130, 137-138) \nAt various times throughout the hearing, Applicant testified about the timeline of \nhis relationship with his current wife to underscore that it was not serious at the time he \ncompleted the 2020 EQIP. He attributed any inconsistencies in his testimony about the \ntimeline to his faulty memory. He could not remember whether he met her in January \n2019 or January 2020. He stated that, following an argument in \u201cmid-2020\u201d or \u201cJune \n2020,\u201d they \u201cstopped talking\u201d for a period that he recalled lasted about \u201csix months, seven \nmonths\u201d or \u201cmaybe seven, eight months, six, seven, eight months, one of those, I don't \nknow which one it was exactly.\u201d He later clarified that they were still talking, but just \u201cdidn\u2019t \nsee each other for a really long time.\u201d Then, he had the following exchange with \nDepartment Counsel: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What did you get into [an argument] about? \nAPPLICANT: Me leaving . . . And I told her I was going to leave -- no, she \nsaid she don't want me to leave, and that was what the argument was about. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: She didn't want you to leave, and that's what \nthe argument was about? \nAPPLICANT: Yeah. . . \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: . . . is it fair to say that she was upset about \nyour leaving because you guys were in a serious relationship? \nAPPLICANT: We wasn't serious. To be honest with you, I don't know why \nshe was upset . . . She probably knew that once I left she would never come \nback to [Country A] . . . So, that's probably what it was. She probably didn't \nwant to leave [Country A] . . . \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Wait, why would your leaving [Country A] mean \nshe was leaving [Country A], was she going to go with you? \nAPPLICANT: I wanted her to go with me, I told her I wanted her to go with \nme, yeah. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay, so that was mid-2020 that you wanted \nher to go with you, wherever you were going to end up? \nAPPLICANT: Yeah. (Tr. at 48-50, 52, 60, 154) \nApplicant struggled to explain why he chose to report his current wife and the \nCountry F national as foreign contacts during his 2021 SI in light of his position that he \ndid not then consider them as such. He stated, \n. . . after the fact, then I probably was like, okay, well, maybe I should just \ntell them . . . Maybe I did not say all the truth [in the 2020 EQIP] but I did \nsay the truth after. And I want to stress that I wasn't trying to hide anything \n. . .  I figured at some point I probably want to . . . get this [top secret \nclearance], which I was applying for, which I know that it's strict, right, \neventually at some point I was like, I was thinking I want to get a poly as \nwell, and you have to tell the truth, so it's better to just tell the truth and just, \nyou know, even if you don't remember it's better to say it and not hide it then \nto hide it and don't say anything, you know, because then you look worse. I \nwould have looked worse if you guys would have been asking me now and \nthen I would have just been like, oh, by the way. Because then that looks \ncrazy. \n. . . I'm just saying, like at the time of the [2020 EQIP] I wasn't even, I wasn't \neven like thinking. Like I wasn't even thinking about it. I was just, you know, \nI was just going through the [2020 EQIP] and just like, you know, most of \nthis stuff really doesn't apply to me. I was assuming most of this stuff really \ndoesn't apply to me. You know, put what you know right now to the best of \nyour knowledge. Put what you know. And that's what I did. I put what I knew \nat the time to the best of my knowledge and then after I was like, well, maybe \nthey need to know. I don't know . . . I was just trying to be truthful about it. \n. . . Well obviously [my current wife], when I was dating her . . . She's [a \nCountry E national] so I was like, they want to know about her, so I should \ntell about her. To say about her, she is [a Country E national] and I'm \nmarried to her so I should say.

(GE 1) \nDuring his 2021 SI, Applicant volunteered that he provided financial support to his \nthen girlfriend (now current wife)\u2019s mother, who was a citizen and resident of Country E \n(Colombia).

Then, he admitted that he gave money to his current wife, initially \nwithout knowing that she was sending the money he gave her to her mother. He stated \nthat he did not report the money he gave to his current wife on his 2020 EQIP because \nhe did not consider it to be financial support. He also stated,  \nSince my last divorce the lawyers and judges made me aware of what\nfinancial support is, and to me giving money to the woman I was dating at\nthe time was not financial support, since we were not living together and not\nin a relationship. The only reason I knew the money [I gave her] went to her\nmom was because on the phone on a random day I hear her say to her\nmom that yes she would send her some money, and that\u2019s when I asked \u201cis\nthe money I give [you] going to your mom[?\u201d] and she answered yes.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant addressed his 2020 EQIP omission by stating, \nSo, again, when I was dating [my current wife], randomly once or a couple \ntimes she would ask me to send her mom some money. I said okay, cool. I \nhad no idea this is a type of support. She wasn't even my girlfriend, I was \njust -- she was a girl, we were dating or whatever, I just gave her some \nmoney.

(GE \n1; GE 3 at 13-14) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that his March 2020 travel to Country E occurred \nafter he met his current wife, but he maintained that he has never traveled with her to \nCountry E.

Regarding SOR \u00b6 2.a, he \nacknowledged that he knew about the debt since at least 2016 or 2017, and that when \nhe asked his ex-wife about this debt while they were married, she wife denied taking any \nloans out in his name. He initially affirmed that he had never contacted the creditor of the \ndebt. Then, he claimed that, while he was in the military and still married to his ex-wife, \nhe emailed a collection company about the debt more than once on dates that he could \nnot recall. He maintained that the collection company would not provide him any \ninformation beyond stating that he was obligated to pay the debt because he was the \nnamed account holder. He denied responsibility for repaying the debt, reiterating his belief \nthat his ex-wife was responsible for the debt. He did not proffer a plan to resolve the debt \nbesides waiting for it to be removed from his CBRs pursuant to the statute of limitations. \n(Tr. at 26-29, 63-75) \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant denied responsibility for repaying the debt. He \ninitially attributed the debt to his ex-wife and denied that he opened the loan. Upon cross-\nexamination, he acknowledged that he opened the loan.

He agreed to pay $2,000 to Company 2 for its services via a one-time $400 \npayment and 16 monthly payments of $100, beginning in April 2018.

I don't do anything, besides dating women, that would \nlike jeopardize my clearance. I don't do anything, my clearance is my life, \nright? Like I said, in the future I want to get a poly, right? So I want to learn \nto tell the truth. Let the government know whatever they want to know. I \nhave no secrets. I'll tell them everything. A lot of people told me that I \nprobably was too honest. They say, you probably shouldn't have said what \nyou said, you were too honest. And I was like, well, what's the point of \ngetting a poly if you're just going to lie. Like, that's why people fail the poly, \nyou're lying. I don't understand the reason. Just tell them the truth, they're \ngoing to find out anyway, it's the U.S. government. You have a clearance, \nyou can't hide the truth from the U.S. government they're going to find out \neventually. Just say what it is. Good or bad, you know what I mean. (Tr. at \n139-142) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes . . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 EQIP falsification establishes the concern set out in AG \u00b6 15, and \nrenders potentially applicable the following disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16 under this \nguideline: \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \n \n \nBecause the falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the \nburden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. An applicant\u2019s education and \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. \nI do not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations and excuses for his 2020 EQIP \nfalsification, particularly given his educational background, military experience, and \nsecurity clearance history. On his 2020 EQIP, by responding \u201cno\u201d to two different \nquestions about his disciplinary record in the military and by specifying the reason for his \nseparation from the military as \u201cenlistment ended,\u201d he revealed an awareness of the \npotential negative impact that the Article 15 could have on his security clearance eligibility. \nThat awareness is underscored by the fact that he did not acknowledge the Article 15 \nuntil after confrontation. He demonstrated his knowledge and understanding of the \nmeaning and security significance of \u201cclose and/or continuing contact with a foreign \nnational\u201d and \u201cfinancial support\u201d of a foreign national by voluntarily disclosing such \ninformation without provocation during his 2021 SI. Accordingly, I find substantial \nevidence of an intent on the part of the Applicant to omit security-significant information \nfrom his 2020 EQIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nApplicant\u2019s solicitation of a prostitute while traveling overseas in or around late \n2019 or 2020, establishes the concern set out in AG \u00b6 15, and the following disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 16 under this guideline: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . (3) while in \nanother country, engaging in any activity that, while legal there, is illegal in \nthe United States. \nHaving considered all of the factors in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the concerns \nunder this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant deliberately concealed reportable and security-significant information \nfrom the Government when he completed his third security clearance application. He paid \nfor sex overseas while in possession of a security clearance, knowing that prostitution is \nillegal in the United States. Those actions demonstrate a pattern of poor judgment and \nwillingness to place his own self-interest above his security obligations. \nApplicant eventually disclosed the Article 15 and his reportable involvement with \nforeign nationals. He solicited a prostitute one time under circumstances not likely to \nrecur. However, his failure to acknowledge or accept responsibility for any wrongdoing \nundercuts mitigation. Moreover, his continued lack of candor and inconsistencies \nthroughout the record not only damage his credibility, but also exacerbate the concern \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I find particularly troubling his attempts \nto backtrack, downplay, and redefine his involvement with his current wife, her mother, \nand the Country F national, given that he had already disclosed the true nature and extent \nthat involvement during his 2021 SI. His feigned ignorance of his security clearance \nobligations and plain English terminology is incredulous considering his background, \ntraining, and experience. \nApplicant has not demonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior to \ndemonstrate reform. Having had the opportunity to observe his demeanor and credibility, \nI am not convinced that his lack of candor is unlikely to recur. I have doubts about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. There remain ongoing concerns about \nhis susceptibility to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and \n17(e) are not established. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debts establish the following disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6 19 under this guideline: (a) inability to satisfy debts; and (c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. \nHaving considered all of the factors in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concerns \nunder this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant failed to establish that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c largely \nresulted from circumstances beyond his control or that he acted responsibly to resolve \nthem. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant received financial counseling, \nfrom either Companies 1 or 2, or elsewhere. I considered the fact that the alleged debts \ndid not appear on his August 2022 or June 2023 CBRs and may be no longer collectible \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndue to the expiration of a statute of limitations. However, earlier CBRs established them \nas his valid debts. The fact that he failed to resolve the debts during the time that they \nwere legally collectible remains security significant. He failed to provide documentary \nevidence to substantiate the basis of his dispute regarding the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a \nor to corroborate his efforts to pay or otherwise resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \nand 2.c. \nAdjudication of security clearance eligibility involves evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and is not a debt-collection proceeding. The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each debt alleged in the \nSOR, or to be debt free; nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be \nresolved first. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the indebtedness and \nthen take significant actions to implement the plan, which Applicant failed to do. Based \non the existing record, I am unable to conclude that his indebtedness is not likely to recur \nand no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the AG, \neach of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. An administrative \njudge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines E and F and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his personal conduct and indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 24-64) \nIn July 2020, Applicant\u2019s dog of 15 years passed away and the loss caused her \nextreme grief.

She parked at a school a \nfew blocks from home, and listened to the radio and drank from another bottle of wine \nshe had with her.

She \nreported that she has not drank alcohol since the DUI arrest in October 2020, and is \nashamed of the incident. (Tr. 24-100; AE F, G; GE 2, 3) \nUnder Guideline I, the SOR alleges the following: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged in 2020 Applicant was diagnosed bipolar disorder and was \ntreated by a psychiatrist from about 2011-2021. In January 2022, a DoD-connected \npsychologist diagnosed her with bipolar disorder and an unspecified anxiety disorder. \nAlcohol use disorder was ruled out. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleged Applicant discontinued her treatment and medication against \nmedical advice and has not returned to see her psychiatrist since June 2021. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleged Applicant was evaluated by a DoD-connected psychologist in \nJanuary 2022. The evaluator used background information, a clinical interview and \nobservations, and a personality assessment for her evaluation. The evaluator stated that \nApplicant acknowledged a history of bipolar disorder and denied that she needed \ncontinuous treatment for this condition. The evaluator stated that without treatment or \nmedication it was possible for episodes or symptoms of depression or hypomania to \noccur. The evaluator noted that documentation had showed that at times Applicant had \nrequested to reduce medication and later needed additional or different medications. The \nevaluator also stated that while Applicant was doing well, she showed signs of hypomania \nduring the interview. The evaluator reported that Applicant does not think she needs \nmental health interventions or medications at this time, and discontinued treatment \nagainst medical advice, so her prognosis is poor, and her judgement, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are likely to be impaired. \nApplicant has experience using medical care to assist her in difficult periods of life. \nWhen she was a child, a sibling was killed in a car accident, and she was given anti-\ndepressant medication. In about 2002, after a job loss, Applicant had seen a therapist for \ndepression, and had terminated their relationship after she felt better. Applicant stated \nthat she has experienced depression at times, but never had a manic episode, nor had \nanyone ever expressed concern she was manic. She asserted that she was never \ndepressed without a valid reason, such as death of a loved one or job loss. She has never \nbeen hospitalized, accused of erratic behavior, or been involved in any incidents at work \nor with the police, outside of the 2020 DUI. She is professionally focused and a high \nachiever, and job loss has impacted her hard. (Tr. 24-100) \nIn about 2011, Applicant lost her job and was depressed. She sought a psychiatrist \nto treat these feelings, so she could move forward. She found a psychiatrist through an \ninternet search. Her initial visit lasted about half hour. Her subsequent appointments, \nwhich occurred a few times a year, only lasted between 5 to 10 minutes, for prescription \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrefills. The psychiatrist provided medication only and did not do psychotherapy or \ncounseling. The medication was intended to stabilize her mood and symptoms of anxiety \nor depression. She reported that the psychiatrist did not do any testing with her, and he \ndid not give her a formal diagnosis, he just treated her symptoms. There is no \ndocumentation in the record from this psychiatrist showing a diagnosis, prognosis, \ntreatment plan, recommendations, or conclusions. (Tr. 24-100) \nApplicant was prescribed a widely used anti-depressant, anxiety medication for \nuse as needed, and a mood stabilizer. Over the years, on her own initiative, she requested \nvarying dosages and changes in medication to find what worked best for her. In 2015, \nafter four years of trying varying combinations and dosages, she did not feel the \nmedications were improving her quality of life. Knowing that she could not just stop taking \nmedication, she worked with her psychiatrist to wean off the anti-depressant medication. \nShe successfully stopped taking this medication without repercussion, and without \nobjection to her plan from her psychiatrist. After her dog died and she felt extreme grief, \nshe took the anti-depressant again for three months, and stopped usage again once she \nfelt better. (Tr. 24-100) \nOver time, Applicant had developed a strong relationship with her regular doctor, \nmaintained steady appointments with her, and relied on her more for medical and \nmedication advice. She also received medical and medication advice from her mother, \nwho is an experienced registered nurse, and her best friend who is a pharmacist. She \nrelied less on her psychiatrist over time because she felt he was putting forth minimal \neffort into their interactions, he was not looking for long term solutions, and she had \ndeveloped a better support system with these other professionals. After her DUI case was \nresolved, Applicant started to wean off the mood stabilizer. She reported that she has a \nfamily history of rheumatoid arthritis and was taking medication for joint pain. She had \nconsulted with her medical advisers, researched the medications, and found that the mod \nstabilizer could hinder her arthritis medication. She told her psychiatrist why she intended \nto wean off the medication, and he was not adamantly opposed to it. She was completely \noff the medication by June 2021. She then terminated her relationship with the \npsychiatrist, as he only provided her prescriptions, which she no longer needed from him. \nAfter she terminated their relationship, she never heard from the psychiatrist again. Any \nfuture medications would be provided by her regular doctor. She was completely off the \nmood stabilizer for six months with no problems. (Tr. 24-100) \nIn January 2022, Applicant was required to meet with a DoD-connected \npsychologist as part of the security clearance process. They had a thirty-minute online \nmeeting. Applicant is social, outgoing, and talkative person, but recalled being nervous in \nthe meeting and talking a lot about her love of gardening. Applicant also completed an \nonline form questionnaire for about an hour. Other than Applicant\u2019s SCA, the specific \nrecords reviewed and relied upon by the DoD-connected psychologist were not identified \nor included with her report or submitted into the record for this case. The evaluator\u2019s report \nincludes incorrect dates and timeline of some events, which undermines the findings.

She had the impression \nfrom the evaluator that without it she would be unable to keep her job or retain a security \nclearance. For this reason alone, after the meeting she requested her regular doctor re-\nprescribe the mood stabilizer, and she has been taking it since that time. (Tr. 24-100) \nIn May 2022, after receiving the SOR and seeing the summarized findings of the \nDoD evaluator, Applicant met with a psychologist for an evaluation and a fresh opinion. \nShe was given two online assessments, including a 600-question assessment. She met \nwith this psychologist in person for several hours. He reported that the evaluation and the \ntesting showed that her personality was within normal limits. Based on his interactions \nand assessment, he diagnosed her with adjustment disorder with anxiety. He found no \ncurrent evidence of bipolar disorder. He stated that her prognosis was good, and she is \nreliable, stable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 24-100; AE H, I) \nIn May 2022, after receiving the SOR and seeing the summarized findings of the \nDoD evaluator, Applicant met online with a physician who is an addiction specialist. He \ninterviewed her and reviewed her health records. He found that she does not have major \ndepressive disorder and he does not believe she has bipolar affective disorder. He stated \nthat depression affects 50% of the population and medication to treat the condition as \nneeded is appropriate. He did not find that she has a problem with alcohol and was \npleased she gave it up after the DUI incident. (Tr. 24-100; AE J) \nWitness One has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor since 2020 and has known her since \n2013. She was with her on the day of the DUI, and said Applicant was not impaired when \nshe left her home. She has no concerns about her demeanor or any substance abuse. \nShe stated that Applicant is an excellent employee, and her performance is outstanding. \nShe is reliable, trustworthy, and should be granted a security clearance. (Tr. 102-108) \nWitness Two, a Vice President at the defense contractor Applicant works for, has \nknown her since 2020. She reported the DUI to him the day after it occurred, and he said \nshe was embarrassed and distraught. He has no concerns about her demeanor or alcohol \nuse. He stated that she is a great employee, fits in well with the team, and should receive \na security clearance. (Tr. 108-113; AE O) \nWitness Three, Applicant\u2019s work colleague, stated Applicant is professional, and \nprocess and detail oriented. She has witnessed no issues with alcohol or demeanor, and \nreports Applicant is consistently stable. (Tr. 113-118; AE T) \nApplicant provided documentation showing her work performance, awards, and \ntraining achievements. She also submitted eleven character letters from work colleagues, \nwhich state that she is a good and skilled employee, reliable, trustworthy, and fit to hold \na security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 details the personal conduct security concern: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for alcohol consumption under AG \n\u00b6 22 and the following is potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under  \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for a DUI in 2020. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it  \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) apply. Applicant had one DUI arrest four years ago, under \nunusual circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic. She never had an alcohol-related \nincident before this arrest, and there have been no subsequent problems. Applicant \ncredibly reported that she stopped consuming alcohol after this incident. This happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, does not cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. She has successfully abstained form \nalcohol use, provided evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. \nThe alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a is considered under the following security concern under AG \n\u00b6 31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged SOR allegations in \u00b61.a. The Guideline G allegations \nwere found for Applicant and the same analysis applies. I have considered the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. Applicant had one DUI arrest four years ago, under \nunusual circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic. She never had an alcohol-related \nincident before this arrest, and there have been no subsequent problems. She has no \nother arrests or criminal charges. She credibly reported that she stopped consuming \nalcohol after this incident. This happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur, does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. Applicant provided rehabilitative evidence, documentation of training, awards \nand work performance, compliance with her sentence and terms of parole, and relevant \nwitness testimony and character letters. There is ample evidence to find there has been \nsuccessful rehabilitation, and mitigation by the passage of time and other factors. The \ncriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for psychological conditions under \nAG \u00b6 28 and the following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe DoD-connected psychologist\u2019s report for the security clearance process \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and (b). AG \u00b6 28(d) was not established because there was \ninsufficient evidence in the record of a treatment plan from Applicant\u2019s former psychiatrist \nto rebut Applicant\u2019s credible testimony about her mental health history and care. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (b), (d), and (e) apply. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to show \nthat her condition is under control and in remission and that she is now stable. She \nprovided documentation from a psychologist and a physician which conducted more \nrecent evaluations of her. The psychologist stated that she was within normal limits, she \nhad temporary anxiety, and there was no current evidence of bipolar disorder. He stated \nthat her prognosis was good, and she is reliable, stable, and trustworthy. The physician \nand addiction specialist found that she does not have major depressive disorder or a \nproblem with alcohol and he does not believe she has bipolar affective disorder. \nApplicant is under her regular doctor\u2019s care and obtains medications, as needed, \nfrom her. There is sufficient evidence in the record, including her credible testimony, to \nfind that her past psychological symptoms and conditions were temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and there are no current indications of emotional instability or \nindication of a current problem. \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence showing that she proactively seeks care \nwhen she needs it. In the past she has obtained counseling and medication to treat \nfeelings of depression or anxiety. Neither are disqualifying conditions, and both are \nexperienced by the majority of the population at different times in life. Her mood and \nsymptoms are under control. She has acted in good faith in seeking treatment and \nterminating treatment when it was no longer needed. The alternative would be to take \nmedications forever that she no longer needs. Applicant worked with her psychiatrist to \nchange her medications and dosages to best suit her. She worked with him to wean off \nher medications and had successful outcomes. She restarted medication to cope with \ntemporary grief or anxiety, and then stopped when it was no longer needed, which is \ncompletely appropriate. She terminated her relationship with the psychiatrist when he was \nno longer needed, and she sought treatment with other professionals she could rely on. \nIn this case there is insufficient evidence of a current problem. Outside of the 2020 \nDUI, which occurred under unusual circumstances of the COVID-19 Pandemic, there is \ninsufficient evidence that Applicant has been erratic, unreliable, untrustworthy, had \nincidents at work or with law enforcement, or behaved in a way that was problematic. The \nrecord shows she is a high achiever and professionally focused. She has the liberty, \nresponsibility, and autonomy to make decisions about her health care and medical \nproviders, and the decisions she made were reasonable and appropriate. \nThis case involves differing expert opinions from mental health treatment \nproviders. The Government\u2019s evaluator only met with Applicant for a half an hour before \nmaking her assessment.

Applicant submitted two \nevaluations and a prognosis from a psychologist and a physician from May 2022. They \neach spent more time with Applicant, and their conclusions are well reasoned and \ncredible. I find these reports to be reflective of the current circumstances, credible, and \naccurate, and give these two reports more weight. \nThe Appeal Board took up the issue of conflicting expert opinions and addressed \nthe administrative judge\u2019s weighing of evidence in ISCR Case No. 19-00151 at 8 (App. \nBd. Dec. 10, 2019): \nA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative \nreliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007). \nA Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an Applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. \nRather, the Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole in \ndecoding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0265 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-\n0288 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000).  \nThe psychological conditions security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have considered the witness testimony, character letters, and \nprofessional achievements. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, J, and \nI in my whole-person analysis. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI had the chance to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and asses her credibility. She \nadequately explained the circumstances surrounding the SOR allegations, and I found \nher testimony and explanations to be credible and substantially corroborated by witness \ntestimony and documentary evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. She provided sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe security concerns under Guidelines G, J, and I. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

He stated that he has not spoken with her in a \nyear, only has contact with her about once a year through one of his half-sisters, and has \nnot seen her since 2017. (Tr. 37-41; Answer; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Bangladesh. \nHe reported that he has quarterly contact with him. His brother is 51 years old, has three \nminor children, and works in human resources for a Bangladeshi corporation. (Tr. 48-54; \nAnswer; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant\u2019s half-sisters are citizens and residents of \nBangladesh, and one is a civilian employee with a Bangladeshi court.

(Tr. 55-60; Answer; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant maintains frequent communications with several \naunts and uncles who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. He reported that he does \nnot maintain contact with aunts and uncles on his father\u2019s side. His mother has four \nsiblings, three live on the same property with her. He asserted that he is not close with \nany of them, but will talk to them out of courtesy if they are present when he speaks to \nhis mother. This contact occurs quarterly. (Tr. 60-66; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant purchased a mobile phone in Bangladesh that he \nuses to maintain communication with Bangladeshi family members and to chat with \nformer Bangladeshi classmates. He reported that he purchased this phone when he \nvisited Bangladesh for three weeks in 2017. His U.S. phone did not work well there and \nwas expensive to use. He reported that he used this phone to keep these communications \nseparate from his U.S. phone. After about two years he could no longer update the phone, \nand it stopped working in early 2020. This was the last time that he had communications \nwith his former classmates. His contact with his relatives is detailed in the other SOR \nallegations.

The U.S. government assesses that \nthere remains a credible terrorist threat against foreigners in Bangladesh.\u202fThere has been \nno significant terrorist attack in Bangladesh since March 2017, but the country remains a \ntarget. \nIn 2021, incidents causing injury and death in Bangladesh derived from hate-based \ncommunal protests and political differences occurred, with some violent extremist group \ninvolvement. In 2022, there were some credible claims of significant human rights \nviolations which were alleged to have occurred in Bangladesh. \nIn AE H, Applicant included mitigating facts concerning Bangladesh from the U.S. \nState Department. I take administrative notice of the following facts: \nIn July 2022, the U.S. State Department reported that Bangladesh is an important \nregional partner on economic, climate, humanitarian, and security priorities. There have \nbeen 50 years of relations with Bangladesh, including multiple high level and strategic \nengagements to deepen bilateral, economic, commercial, and security collaboration, and \npromote security, human rights, rule of law, and freedom of expression. The U.S. has \ninvested over $8 Billion in Bangladesh to improve the lives of its citizens. Bangladesh \nrecently hosted nearly one million refugees fleeing Burma. Bangladesh is the largest \ncontributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations. Both countries belong to many of \nthe same international and regional organizations. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant maintains close and continuing contact with his mother and three \nsiblings, who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c, and 1.d. It was not established that Applicant maintains close and continuing contact \nwith his step-mother, or his aunts and uncles. Possessing a phone that was purchased in \na foreign country is not disqualifying behavior under AG \u00b6 7. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f are \nnot established. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence and testimony to find that \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and \n8(c) apply. While he is close to his mother, and has continuing contact and affection for \nhis siblings, it is unlikely that he will be placed in the position of having to choose between \ntheir interests and the interests of the U.S. He has been living in the U.S. for about 25 \nyears, and his wife, all of his assets, and employment are all in the U.S. He has only been \nto Bangladesh once in 25 years. \nApplicant has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, and can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nGiven the U.S. relationship with Bangladesh and the country conditions in Bangladesh, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere is little likelihood that these relationships could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters and his service working for a \ndefense contractor. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nI had the chance to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and assess his credibility. The \ninformation he provided was thorough, he adequately explained the circumstances \nsurrounding the SOR allegations, and I found his testimony and explanations to be \ncredible and substantially corroborated by documentary evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

After returning to the United States, he continued to work for the same \nemployer until he was terminated in November 2018 for purported timecard fraud in \n2013 while deployed to a Mideast location, discussed below. (GE 1; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that in about February 2013 Applicant received a written \nwarning from his defense-contractor employer, for time mischarging. (GE 5) \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted that he received a written warning from \nhis employer for time mischarging. However, he denied that he was mischarging his \ntime. He added that this written warning was given to all personnel supporting their unit \nat their location in the Mideast.

(Tr. 43-44) \u201c[A]fter almost four years of working overseas \nback and forth,\u201d he returned to the United States after learning that his mother was ill. \nShe passed away after he returned home. After his mother\u2019s passing, he returned to the \nMideast on two occasions at the request of his employer. During this entire time period \nhe was allowed to retain his CAC and have continued access to his various secure job \nsites and military installations. (Tr. 44-45) \nApplicant received a warning letter in February 2013. The warning stated that he \nhad \u201cinaccurately recorded time to the [Site X] program while OCONUS. Specifically, \nyou were charging time directly to the contract for hours in which you did not perform \nwork.\u201d \nThe warning letter does not contain any specific examples of inaccurately \nrecorded time. When cross-examined, Applicant denied that he recorded inaccurate \ntime. Applicant inquired whether he could \u201ccould appeal (the warning letter) or submit \nany kind of rebuttal or anything\u201d and was informed by management that he could not do \nanything about it. (Tr. 59-60; GE 3, GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that in about November 2018 Applicant was terminated from \nhis employment by a defense contractor for evidence of time mischarging and that he is \nnot eligible for rehire. While the Government evidence clearly documents that an \ninvestigation was conducted regarding significant timecard fraud that occurred at a \nMideast location where Applicant was deployed, it does not provide specifics that \nimplicate Applicant. (GE 1-4, 6-7) \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted to being terminated from his employment \nand reiterated his denial that he was mischarging his time. He explained that his \nemployer: \n. . . as part of a settlement with the Government paid 30 million dollars on \n31 October 2018, to make the U.S. Department of Justice investigation to \ngo away [sic]. As part of the settlement [defense contractor] said they \nwould terminate everyone who was at [unit working in the Mideast]. Most \nwere still working at [defense contractor], some 8 years later. \nApproximately 20 people were terminated, eight years later, while still \nbeing employed at [defense contractor] on November 1, 2018. I was one \nof them. When I had my Security Clearance investigation, 2019, all these \nfacts were brought to the attention of the investigator. I was granted my \nSecurity Clearance which I have held since the mid 1980\u2019s. [Defense \ncontractor] has never presented any factual evidence that I had \nmischarged my time. (SOR Answer) \nWhen Applicant was terminated in November 2018, he was provided with a \ngeneric letter with little explanation other than he was being terminated for mischarging \nhis time and that incidents went back to 2011 and no specific dates were provided. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was not provided with other documentation or information, and there was no \nway to determine if there was one or multiple incidents of mischarging. (Tr. 32-34, 45-\n46; GE 3-5) Applicant was one of 16 employees terminated by his former employer for \nalleged timecard fraud, and 5 of those 16 employees are now working for Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent defense contractor. (Tr. 32, 62-63) \nThe Mideast location (Site X) where the timecard issues arose was unique in the \nsense that the contractors assigned there did not live on base but lived on the local \neconomy. In Applicant\u2019s case, he lived in a hotel apartment. Travel time from \nemployees\u2019 living quarters to the work site \u201cwas a billable event when [he] first showed \nup at the site.\u201d When that practice changed, Applicant changed his practice to comply \nwith the company rules. Remote working from one\u2019s hotel room was also a billable \nevent. When that was no longer allowed, Applicant again changed his practice to \ncomply with the company rules. In short, Applicant \u201ccomplied with all the changes as \nthey came out.\u201d (Tr. 48-50) Applicant is doing work for his current employer similar to \nwhat he did for his previous employer. (Tr. 50) His current employer is \u201cfully aware\u201d of \nthe SOR allegations against him and the circumstances that led to his termination. (Tr. \n51, 62-63; GE 3) \nApplicant reiterated during cross-examination that whatever he was charging on \nhis timecard was \u201cin line with [former employer\u2019s] policy.\u201d At the time and at Site X \nlocation, it did not strike him as unusual that management instructed him to include \ntravel time or remote work time. When management told employees that they could no \nlonger charge travel time at Site X, Applicant complied. He added that \u201c. . . part of that \ntravel time is not just driving; it\u2019s getting into the base. You have to go through the [base \nsecurity] checkpoint and sometimes that would take forever.\u201d (Tr. 52-56; GE 1) As part \nof the investigation surrounding the timecard charging issue, Applicant was not \ninterviewed by any federal or military law enforcement agency. He was interviewed by \nattorneys employed by his former employer and the questions they asked him were \ndirected \u201cabout other people . . . nothing directed to [him].\u201d (Tr. 57) \nApplicant called a co-worker (CJ) as a witness. CJ has known Applicant since \n\u201caround the end of \u2013 December of 2011, maybe early 2012.\u201d CJ worked for the same \ndefense contractor as a field engineer at Site X in the Mideast at the same time as \nApplicant. CJ also received a warning letter and was terminated like Applicant. CJ is \ncurrently employed as a systems engineer for the same defense contractor as \nApplicant. CJ has a Secret security clearance and has successfully held a clearance \nsince 2006 except for \u201ca gap around 2018 to 2019.\u201d (Tr. 18-22, 32) \nCJ described the timecard charging issue, \u201cThey (former defense contractor) \nwere blanketing across pretty much any employee that worked overseas during 2010 to \n2013 time frame. They just blanketed and covered pretty much every employee with a \nwarning in their personnel records.\u201d CJ stated it was never proven that he and/or \nApplicant had committed timecard fraud. CJ was never required to repay any money for \novercharged time. (Tr. 20-21) When asked why it took five years to terminate him and \nthe other employees, CJ answered, \u201c. . . that\u2019s the \u2013 in my mind \u2013 (the) million-dollar \nquestion.\u201d (Tr. 22) CJ stated that his former employer was \u201cconstantly re-shifting and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nevolving their time-charging policy throughout the five or six years between 2011 or \n2013 or 2018.\u201d (Tr. 34) CJ was not aware that he could appeal his termination from his \nformer employer, and when terminated, he started looking for other work. (Tr. 35) \nCJ confirmed that while he was at Site X in the Mideast it was company policy to \nbill for travel time and remote working. (Tr. 22-23, 25) He added that timekeeping at his \nformer employer \u201cchanged multiple times over the course of seven, maybe eight years \nthat [he] was involved with the overseas operation. Those early 2011 to 2013 years, you \nwere allowed \u2013 the policy was we\u2019d charge for travel, remote work from hotel, and on-\ncall, as long as you\u2019re available.\u201d These policy changes created confusion among the \nemployees. (Tr. 23, 25) CJ discussed some individuals at Site X who were committing \ntimecard fraud and were terminated at the beginning of 2013. (Tr. 24) CJ stated that he \ndid not believe there was any deliberate mischarging of time by Applicant based on his \nown personal knowledge. (Tr. 24) CJ stated the number of people working at Site X \nvaried from 12 to 20 depending on the mission. It was the managers of these 12 to 20 \npeople who gave the direction to charge for travel time. (Tr. 27) \nCJ is aware that his name as well as Applicant\u2019s name, among other names, are \non a settlement agreement between his former employer and the U.S. Attorney. CJ \ndescribed this settlement \u201cas to what they speculate that we did in violation of time-\ncharging.\u201d CJ reiterated that management knew where he was at all times. (Tr. 28-29; \nGE 7) CJ is aware that his former employer \u201cagreed to pay roughly $25 million back to \nthe U.S. Government in restitution for the time-charging issue.\u201d CJ is unaware of how \nhis former employer and the Government reached this settlement amount. (Tr. 29-30) \nCJ\u2019s clearance was renewed and favorably adjudicated in the \u201csummer of 2019.\u201d At the \ntime of Applicant\u2019s hearing, CJ\u2019s application for a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented \nInformation Clearance was pending. (Tr. 31) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted his performance evaluation reviews for 2020 to 2022. His \nemployee evaluations were very favorable, with his 2022 overall employee rating being \n\u201c4.99 \u2013 Outstanding.\u201d An element of his evaluations which was part of his overall rating \nwas \u201cCompany Values \u2013 Do the right thing \u2013 Integrity, honesty, and transparency in all \nour dealings.\u201d It is clear from Applicant\u2019s evaluations that he is a top performer, who is a \nvalued employee and contributes to his company\u2019s mission and the national defense. \n(Tr. 63; AE A, AE B) \nApplicant submitted five reference letters: (1) Director of Programs (MD) from his \ncurrent employer; (2) Director of Test and Integration and his manager (TH); (3) Co-\nworker (CJ) \u2013 has known Applicant for ten years and worked with him for the same \nprevious employer at Site X in the Mideast during the timecard issue; (4) Co-worker \n(PD) has known Applicant for 15 years and works for Applicant\u2019s previous employer; \nand (5) husband and wife neighbors (KR and DR), who have known Applicant for 30 \nyears.

(Tr. 65-66; AE E-H) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct may be a security concern, stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (4) evidence of \nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence met the threshold to establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nrequiring further review to determine the applicability of any mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is fully applicable. The Government\u2019s evidence clearly established that \nhe was given a written warning letter in 2013 for purported time mischarging, and that \nhis employer terminated him in 2018 for time mischarging. The termination in 2018 was \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfor timecard fraud five years earlier, and was based on a global settlement agreement \nbetween the DoJ and his employer which entailed termination of multiple employees for \ntimecard fraud without regard for the individual employee\u2019s conduct. There is no specific \nor sufficient credible evidence to support the inferences that Applicant\u2019s warning and \ntermination by his former employer were based on actual misconduct or dishonesty by \nhim. Lastly, I found Applicant to be a credible witness whose testimony was \ncorroborated by his co-worker CJ. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor for Guideline E. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant or continue \nnational security eligibility \u201cmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments \nunder Guideline E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old systems engineer who seeks to retain his Secret \nsecurity clearance. He has successfully held a clearance for the past 35-plus years and \nhas been employed as a defense contractor for the majority of his adult working life. \nIt appears that Applicant was caught up in an unfortunate situation that was not \nof his own making. Applicant was employed by his previous employer from 2007 to \n2018, and during that 11-year period his performance met company standards. In fact, \nhis company thought enough of him to send him on five deployments to the Mideast and \nkept him on the company payroll for five years after his 2013 warning letter for \nmischarging time. \nApplicant\u2019s clearance was renewed in 2019.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old engineer employed by a federal contractor since \nNovember 2023.

(GE 1; Tr. 49-54, 126-127) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling approximately $47,380, including \nthree charged-off vehicle loans totaling $43,475. Applicant attributes his financial \nproblems to unemployment and underemployment. After he was injured and unable to \nwork in June 2015, he used his savings to pay his mortgage and other bills until his \nsavings were depleted.

He has saved more than $160,000 by reducing expenses, selling a home \nin 2021, working overtime, sharing household expenses with his girlfriend, and staying in \nhousing provided under his contract. He focused on paying smaller or more recent debt \nand rebuilding his credit score by opening credit accounts secured by funds he deposited. \nHe has sufficient funds to resolve all debts alleged in the SOR and said he would do so, \nif necessary. He said he was confused about what to do because he understood payment \nof the debts may not resolve security concerns. He has not sought formal financial \ncounseling but has discussed debt-related matters with his girlfriend\u2019s coworkers at a \nfinancial institution. (GE 1 at 18, GE 2, 7-9; Tr. 45-62, 80-83, 147-148) \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-1.b: medical accounts placed for collection of $822 and $658. \nCredit reports from April and October 2022 show both accounts were first delinquent in \nSeptember 2016, and assigned for collection in April 2018 and August 2018, respectively. \n(GE 7 at 2, GE 8 at 2) Applicant admitted the allegations, said he contacted the creditor \nto set up a payment plan, and submitted evidence the creditor offered to settle both debts \nin May 2022. (Answer) He testified he paid the debts, and submitted documentary \nevidence he paid $769 on August 18, 2023, to settle them. (Tr. 62; AE A at 1, AE B) \nThese two debts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: auto loan charged off for $22,770. Applicant admitted the allegation, \nsaid this loan was part of a class action lawsuit for predatory lending, submitted \ndocumentary evidence of a lawsuit, and said that he unsuccessfully attempted to \nnegotiate a settlement. (Answer; Tr. 67-73) Credit reports from April 2020, October 2022 \nand November 2023 show the loan account was opened in September 2018, the last \npayment was in May 2019, and the account was charged off with a past-due balance of \n$22,770. (GE 7 at 4, GE 8 at 6, GE 9 at 8) \nApplicant testified that he signed the loan agreement and later contacted the \ncreditor to renegotiate terms when he realized it included an interest rate of about 25 \npercent. The creditor refused. Applicant did not know what to do so he put the vehicle in \nstorage. He did not recall if he had made a payment on the loan or if his last payment was \nin May 2019. He received about $900 as his share of a class action lawsuit settlement \nwith the creditor a year or two before the hearing. He discussed the loan with his \ngirlfriend\u2019s coworkers at a financial institution and was confused about what to do because \nhe understood if he started making payments or returned the vehicle it could harm his \ncredit and restart a seven-year statute of limitations. (Tr. 67-73, 130-131) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted documentary evidence he reached a \nsettlement agreement to satisfy the debt for $10,000 on December 7, 2023, and that a \npayment in that amount was authorized on December 11, 2023. (AE A at 1, AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit card charged off for $3,245. Applicant admitted the allegation, \nsaid this debt was for a credit card he used to pay bills while unemployed, and submitted \na letter dated May 12, 2022, confirming an agreement to settle the debt for $1,298, if paid \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nno later than June 13, 2022. (Answer; Tr. 60, 73-77) He testified that he made no effort \nto resolve this debt prior to 2022. He did not pay the settlement amount in June 2022 \nbecause he did not have sufficient funds to do so and because the debt was within a \nmonth of falling off his credit report due to age. He requested the settlement agreement \nbecause his then employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) told him it would resolve \nsecurity concerns about this debt. (Tr. 63, 78-79) After the hearing he submitted a written \nstatement in which he claimed this debt is no longer on his credit report and has been \nresolved or is up to date. (AE A) He submitted no evidence this debt has been resolved. \nAn April 2020 credit report shows the account was opened in 2005, last payment \nin July 2015, charged off with a past due balance of $3,245, and \u201cconsumer disputes after \nresolution.\u201d (GE 7 at 5) This account is not reflected in credit reports from October 2022 \nand November 2023. (GE 8-9) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f: auto loans charged off for $6,879 and $13,826. Applicant \nadmitted the allegations, said he had \u201creached out to creditor . . . to work on a settlement \noption,\u201d and submitted two letters dated May 12, 2022, confirming agreements to settle \nthe debts for $2,751 and $5,530, respectively, if paid no later than June 13, 2022. \n(Answer) An April 2020 credit report shows the accounts were opened in April 2015, with \nlast payments in October 2016 and September 2018, and charged off with past-due \nbalances of $6,879 and $13,826, respectively. (GE 7 at 5) Credit reports from October \n2022 and November 2023 do not list the accounts. (GE 8-9) \nApplicant testified that he cosigned the smaller loan for a friend with bad credit. He \nno longer has contact with her, had no idea where the vehicle was located, and will never \nmake the mistake of cosigning a loan again. The larger loan was for a truck he purchased \nfor approximately $30,000 about a month before he was injured and unable to work. The \nvehicle was repossessed in 2017 or 2018. The loan was insured but the insurer did not \nmake payments after he was hurt because of an ambiguous timing issue. He did not pay \nthe settlement amounts in June 2022 because he did not have sufficient funds and \nbecause the debts were about to fall off his credit report due to age. He requested \nsettlement agreements because his then employer\u2019s FSO told him that would resolve \nsecurity concerns about the debts. (Tr. 45-46, 60, 72-81, 131-133, 147-148) After the \nhearing he submitted a written statement in which he claimed his debt to this creditor is \nno longer on his credit report and has been resolved or is up to date. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims. (AE A) These debts are not resolved. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR includes three allegations under this guideline. (SOR as amended) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: criminally charged in about 19 incidents from 1999 to 2019. \nApplicant admitted the allegation and indicated \u201cmost charges [w]ere traffic violations \n[from] several years ago.\u201d (Answer) He testified as follows.

(GE \n10) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish three disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(b) \n(\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b (totaling \n$1,480). However, none of the above mitigating conditions are established for the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f. While Applicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment were \nconditions beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \nhas had the financial ability to pay the debts for the past few years but, except for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, has chosen to ignore them. He has not provided evidence of a \nreasonable basis to dispute any of these debts and has not sought or received financial \ncounseling. A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). His behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAlthough Applicant reached an agreement to settle the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \n($22,770) and authorized payment of the $10,000 settlement amount in December 2023, \nhis actions do not warrant full mitigative credit.

Sep. 21, 2009). \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f. (totaling $23,130) are long-standing and \nongoing. Applicant has made no payment on any of these debts since at least September \n2018. Although he negotiated settlement agreements for each debt in 2022, there is \ninsufficient evidence to find he adhered to a good-faith effort to resolve them because he \nmade no payments under those agreements and apparently never intended to. That these \ndebts have dropped off recent credit reports is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. \nSee ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016). The security concerns \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s ongoing delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct  \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish the conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a (criminally charged or cited for non-criminal traffic offenses in about 19 incidents \nfrom 1999 to 2019) and 2.b (false claim to fraudulently obtain spousal insurance benefits \nin October 2019). The record includes substantial evidence that establishes the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c (terminated for cause for conduct and behavior in June 2022 \nincluding failing to submit required documents, inappropriate text messages to other \nemployees containing foul and threatening language, and refusal to return his CAC card \nupon termination). \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination wider any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.

Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing[.] \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d) and 16(e) are established by Applicant\u2019s criminal history, false \nclaim to fraudulently secure employment-related insurance benefits, and termination for \ncause because of inappropriate conduct and his refusal to return his CAC card upon \ntermination. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling  \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are fully established.

Although \nhis last criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, his lengthy criminal history \nand troubling personal conduct in 2019 and 2022, and his failure to take responsibility for \nhis personal conduct \u201cundercuts a conclusion of reform and rehabilitation,\u201d and makes it \ndifficult to conclude that such behavior is unlikely to recur. ISCR Case No. 20-00331 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2021). \nApplicant claims that he left Company A because he was asked to participate in \nnefarious conduct at about the same time his attempt to fraudulently obtain spousal \ninsurance benefits for a person not his wife was discovered. This assertion is \nuncorroborated and not credible. His continued false denial of this conduct shows he is \nstill vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. Although his termination for \ncause by Company B would not, standing alone, necessarily be disqualifying, his \ndisruptive and other inappropriate behavior resulting in his termination, and his conduct \nafter he was terminated are not mitigated. Based upon the entire record, I cannot find \nsuch behavior unlikely to recur and find that his conduct continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, employment history, and that his financial problems were caused, in part, by \ncircumstances beyond his control. I also considered he has saved more than $160,000 \nover the past several years, made substantial efforts to rehabilitate his credit score, \nresolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, and settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nHowever, Applicant has not demonstrated a reliable financial track record in addressing \nhis delinquent debts. I also considered his personal conduct, lack of candor, unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations, failure to acknowledge his inappropriate behavior \nand the risk of recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, I did not find Applicant to be credible. His testimony and demeanor during \nthe hearing were unconvincing and inconsistent with someone who was reliably telling \nthe truth. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On October 24, 2015, she was arrested and \ncharged with Obstructing Police, Resisting Arrest and Harassment. The police were \ncalled because she \u201cwas on some type of narcotic and was combative and fighting [and] \nhitting her head on the stop sign.\u201d (GE 7 at 1-2) Her mother-in-law reported that Applicant \nsaid she had taken an \u201cAmphetamine Pill, [some over the counter medications], and had \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nsmoked spice.\u201d (GE 7 at 2) The arresting officer wrote that she \u201cwas irate and belligerent \nand [said that] she was high and possessed because she had read [sic] pigs in a parlor \nand continued to talk out of her head.\u201d Id. She spit on a police officer when he tried to \ncalm her down and repeatedly banged her head against a window inside a police car. \nShe was placed in jail for five days and the charges were later dismissed. (GE 1 at 37-\n38, GE 2 at 3-4, GE 4 at 8-9, GE 7; Tr. 28, 34-36)  \nIn about November 2015, a judge ordered Applicant into inpatient mental health \ncare and she was hospitalized for about one month. She said she was treated for \npsychosis and was diagnosed with \u201cschizoaffective disorder.\u201d (GE 2 at 4, GE 4 at 9) She \nsaid she experienced an episode of \u201cacute psychosis\u201d and a \u201cmental breakdown,\u201d that \nshe experienced \u201cauditory, and visual hallucinations,\u201d and was very aggressive until she \nreceived inpatient treatment. (Tr. at 36; GE 2 at 4) She reported suffering from \nundiagnosed post-partum depression at the time, and said she was impacted by the loss \nof her job in April 2015, her grandfather\u2019s death in August 2015, and was sleeping less \nthan two hours a night. She said she ingested a lot of caffeine and took over the counter \nmedications and supplements but had not taken illegal drugs or consumed alcohol. (GE \n4 at 8; Tr. 30-34) \nIn December 2015, Applicant was referred for outpatient care; her intake form \nstated she was diagnosed with \u201cPsychotic disorder NOS\u201d and \u201cStimulant use disorder.\u201d \n(GE 5 at 5-6) From October 2015 until May 2016, she was prescribed various medications \nincluding antipsychotics, antidepressants, and sleep medication. (GE 5) She said she \nwas too heavily medicated and described feeling like a zombie, drooling, being unable to \nwalk well or interact with others, and being unable to perform normal daily functions. (GE1 \nat 35-36, GE 2 at 2, GE 4 at 9, GE 5; Tr. 35-38) \nIn about May 2016, she went to the emergency room because she was \nexperiencing stroke-like symptoms. She was subsequently hospitalized for about five \ndays and diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder. Her medications were changed and she said \nthe change \u201cwas wonderful, I became myself again, I could do things again. . . . I could \nplay with my kids, I could get a job again.\u201d (Tr. 40-41) Her outpatient treatment plan \nincluded taking prescribed medications, monthly appointments with a counselor and a \npsychiatrist, and implementing stress management skills. She complied with her \ntreatment plan until October 30, 2017, when outpatient treatment was terminated because \nshe \u201cmissed several scheduled appointments[.]\u201d (GE 5 at 47) Applicant attributed her \ndecision to stop going to her appointments to disliking her psychiatrist, difficulty making \nappointments due to her work schedule, and her medical doctor\u2019s agreement to continue \nprescribing the medications if she discontinued outpatient mental health treatment. (GE \n1 at 35, GE 2 at 4, GE 5; Tr. 38-54) \nApplicant said that she saw a counselor at a different mental health facility about \nfour times from late 2017 through early 2018. Medical records from February 7, 2018 to \nMay 14, 2018 and signed by Doctor (Dr.) I, Applicant\u2019s primary care physician, show that \nshe was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and insomnia and was prescribed the \nsame mental health medications that had previously proven effective.

(Tr. 61) She \nsaid she stopped taking her previously prescribed mental health medications in about \nNovember 2020, January 2021, and December 2022, respectively. She reports no \nnegative effects or any significant mental health issues since she stopped taking the \nmedications and says she has used appropriate coping mechanisms to maintain her \nmental health. (GE 2 at GE 5; Tr. 51-62) She has occasionally spoken to a professional \ncounselor provided by her employer when she has felt like she needed \u201ca little bit of one \non one.\u201d (Tr. 58-59) \nIn September 2021, Applicant agreed to participate in a psychological evaluation \nrequested by DoD CAF. (GE 3) In January 2022, a DoD-affiliated licensed clinical \npsychologist and board-certified neuropsychologist evaluated Applicant. She interviewed \nApplicant, reviewed records including a DoD background investigation, and medical \nrecords. Her Diagnostic Impressions included: \n[T]he following diagnoses is appropriate at this time: \nBipolar I disorder \nR/O \nSchizoaffective disorder \nH/O \nStimulus use disorder \nThe applicant is not a reliable historian, and therefore the diagnosis \nindicated above is based on review of all available medical records and my \nclinical judgement. The initial emergence of mania within the records may \nhave been prompted by stimulant use, but it appears that there have been \nother occurrences of mania and psychosis at times that she was not noted \nto be using stimulants (although I am not certain that drug tests would \nsuccessfully identify use if it was via over the counter medications). There \nare also indications of psychosis, which could be due to schizophrenia \n(particularly given the family history); however, this could also be a symptom \nof mania. Because the applicant lacked candor during this interview, I am \nnot able to fully determine if she has schizoaffective disorder vice bipolar \ndisorder. I am also unable to determine if there are ongoing issues with \nstimulant abuse, as she would not admit to any history of stimulant use \nwhatsoever.  \nAt the conclusion of the interview, I asked [Applicant] if there was anything \nelse she wanted to address. She replied, \u201cin my [inpatient care medical \nrecords] they said I had a stimulant abuse history, but I don\u2019t.\u201d [Applicant] \nelaborated that while in [inpatient care in about November 2015] she had to \nsubmit a urinalysis and hair test and that neither result demonstrated \nstimulant use.

(GE 2 at 6-7)     \nIn August 2019, a lab test detected the unexpected presence of benzodiazepine \ndrugs in Applicant\u2019s specimen.

She acknowledged that at the time of the positive sample she \n\u201ch[ad] some [medication containing benzodiazepine] in [her] medicine cabinet\u201d from an \nold prescription, and that \u201cthe only thing I can think of is that I took some of that by \nmistake[.]\u201d (Tr. 28-35, 63-66, 98-99) \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor observed the entire hearing at her request and \ntestified.

The company has many employees with disabilities and has \u201ccounselors \non board that are available [to employees] at any time.\u201d (Tr. 92) He first learned of many \nof her past life experiences and mental health challenges during the hearing and said that \nhe would never have known about them otherwise. She is one of the company\u2019s top \nemployees, always on time, reliable, and has a great work ethic. She has earned his and \nother supervisors trust and was very aware of responsibilities associated with a security \nclearance. She has successfully dealt with many stressful situations and additional \nresponsibilities. He recommended she be granted eligibility for access to classified \ninformation without hesitation or reservation. (Tr. 7-9, 17, 91-97) \nAt hearing, Applicant was informed of the importance of submitting documentary \nevidence to corroborate her testimony including examples of potentially relevant \ninformation. She did not submit any documentary evidence after the hearing.  (Tr. 13, 80-\n91, 97-100)   \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation\nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of\nemotional instability; and \n \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions may be \ncontrollable with treatment. She successfully complied with a treatment plan from \nDecember 2015 until October 2017, but then she stopped going to scheduled \nappointments. There is evidence she received some counselling and continued \nmedications prescribed under her previous treatment plan until mid-2018, but there is no \ndocumentary evidence of ongoing or consistent compliance with a treatment plan since. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) are not established, because the DoD-approved mental \nhealth professional provided an unfavorable prognosis and there is no evidence of a \nrecent favorable prognosis by a qualified mental health professional. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e) are not fully established. Applicant has learned and \nimplemented some coping methods to mitigate the impact of her psychological conditions \nand has not shown indications of emotional instability in her workplace. However, her \npsychological conditions are not temporary, and a qualified mental health professional \nconcluded that her prognosis is poor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, work history, testimony of her supervisor, and medical history including the \npsychological report. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her psychological conditions. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

From April 2014 \nto April 2018, he worked as an independent contractor for a company owned by the \ngovernment of Country A. He served in the Marine Corps from December 1990 to March \n1995 and in the Army from July 1995 to July 2011, was honorably discharged, and retired \nas an E-7.

(GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 13, 28-36, \n79-84) \nApplicant has been married since May 1995. He was previously married from May \n1991 to May 1993.

He graduated from high school in 1989 and completed about 36 college credit hours. \n(GE 1; Tr. 83-84) \nApplicant worked in Country A from November 2011 to April 2018. He was \nemployed by a federal contractor from November 2011 to April 2014, and his pay was \nsubject to income tax withholding. He used a tax preparation service provided by his \nemployer to file annual income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2011 through TY 2014. From \nApril 2014 to April 2018, he earned about $200,000 per year as an independent contractor \nfor a company owned by the government of Country A and his pay was not subject to \nincome tax withholding.

Applicant filed his federal income tax \nreturns for TY 2019 and TY 2020 in May 2022. He said those filings were delayed \nbecause he was missing required information, had experienced difficulties with tax filing \nsoftware, and tax preparer delay. He has not claimed or submitted documentary evidence \nhe filed federal income tax returns for TY 2015 through TY 2018. (Answer; GE 1 at 44-\n46, GE 3 at 4-5; AE B, C, G, K, L, P, Q; Tr. 22-58)  \nApplicant testified he had been frustrated with the TSC\u2019s delay in filing his income \ntax returns for TY 2015 through TY 2018. When asked about his communications with \nthe TSC since September 2018, Applicant testified: \nI don't recall. I've had some email contact with them when they were looking \nfor different documentation. So I really haven't --I don't recall. Again, that's \none of the things I was hoping that would just go away, and it didn't.

This is by no means inferring \nthey are settled, but the IRS doesn\u2019t accept filings that have surpassed \nseven years.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2015 through TY 2018 \nand filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2019 and TY 2020 in May 2022. He \napparently mailed his TY 2018 federal income tax return to his tax service provider on \nMarch 6, 2024, for signature by the tax preparer and filing with the IRS. He earned about \n$200,000 per year as an independent contractor from TY 2015 through TY 2017 but, to \ndate, has not paid federal income taxes on that income. He claims that he will be able to \nnegotiate a payment agreement with the IRS after his TY 2018 federal income tax is filed. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are not established. There is insufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems will be resolved within a reasonable period.

His tax issues are longstanding, ongoing, and continue to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established.

Although Applicant has engaged a TSC and \nreceived some counseling, his tax problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not provided evidence to substantiate \nthe basis of any disputed taxes owed or provided evidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established for past-due federal income tax returns (TY 2019 \nand TY 2020), which have been filed. However, it is not established for his unfiled federal \nincome tax returns for TY 2015 through TY 2018, or for his unpaid federal income taxes \nfor TY 2015 through TY 2017. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an \nevaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that he \nhas filed some of his past-due federal income tax returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, \ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmilitary service, employment history, and security clearance history.

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i, 1.m, 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, and 2.f. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 62-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since March 2015. He immigrated to the United States in 1981. He has held a secret clearance since February 2016, except for the period from 2022 to 2023 when it was suspended by his security office due to the SOR that was withdrawn. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1984 and divorced in 1986. He is married to his second wife but has been separated from her since 2005. (GE 1) She has been hospitalized since December 2023. He has three adult children. (Tr. 75) The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts and identifies significant financial losses attributable to gambling. It also alleges that Applicant has not been truthful with the Government about his finances and gambling losses. The debts are reflected in credit reports from May 2020; November 2021; August 2022; March 2023; February 2024; and September 2024. (GE 2 at 25-27, GE 9-GE 14, GE 17) The evidence concerning the debts, gambling losses, and falsification alleged in the SOR is summarized below. Applicant first started gambling in casinos in the early 1990s. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1994, though he claims gambling did not contribute to his financial problems at that time. (G",

On \nApril 27, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The SOR was then withdrawn by the Government. \n(GE 18) On March 28, 2024, the DCSA CAS sent him a new SOR alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines F and E. The DCSA CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), which became effective \non June 8, 2017.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \nof hearing on October 9, 2024, scheduling the hearing for October 15, 2024. Applicant \nwaived the 15-day notice requirement. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 17, one administrative notice document \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and one exhibit index, marked HE II. GE 1 through GE 17 \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He presented 16 \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through P.

On \nOctober 16, 2024, Department Counsel presented HE III and GE 18. On October 17, \n2024, Applicant presented AE Q. GE 18 and AE Q were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 22, 2024. \nProcedural Ruling \nOn October 15, 2024, the Government filed a Motion to Amend the SOR, citing \nApplicant\u2019s clarifications offered in his Answer. Applicant had no objections to the \namendments offered. Allegations \u00b6 1.b, 1.i, and 2.f are amended to read: \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Between at least 2006 and 2023, you have borrowed money or \nengaged in significant financial transactions to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts. For example, in September 2006 you issued a $3,000 \nworthless check for casino credit slips or a credit line as set forth in \nsubparagraph 1.l, below; in about 2013 or 2014 you wrote a worthless check \ntotaling $250 to a casino as set forth in subparagraph 1.i, below; in June \n2017 you took two $2,140 credit card advances for use at the [local] casino \nas set forth in subparagraph 1.e, below; and in September 2021 you took \nan early withdrawal of $29,654 from your tax deferred annuity plan (403(b) \nretirement plan) to satisfy gambling debts and other debts that could have \nbeen paid with funds that you lost gambling. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: You were indebted to [collection agent] for two accounts placed \nfor collection by [creditor] for a worthless check you had written in a casino \nin about 2013 or 2014 in the approximate amount of $250, and for a $35 \nfee. You did not satisfy these delinquencies until May 2023. \nSOR \u00b6 2.f: In about 2013 or 2014, you issued a worthless check for $250 at \na casino, as set forth in subparagraph 1.i, above.

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i, 1.m, 2.a, 2.c, \n2.d, and 2.f. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since \nMarch 2015. He immigrated to the United States in 1981. He has held a secret clearance \nsince February 2016, except for the period from 2022 to 2023 when it was suspended by \nhis security office due to the SOR that was withdrawn. He is a high school graduate. He \nmarried in 1984 and divorced in 1986. He is married to his second wife but has been \nseparated from her since 2005. (GE 1) She has been hospitalized since December 2023. \nHe has three adult children. (Tr. 75) \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts and identifies significant financial losses \nattributable to gambling. It also alleges that Applicant has not been truthful with the \nGovernment about his finances and gambling losses. The debts are reflected in credit \nreports from May 2020; November 2021; August 2022; March 2023; February 2024; and \nSeptember 2024. (GE 2 at 25-27, GE 9-GE 14, GE 17) The evidence concerning the \ndebts, gambling losses, and falsification alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nApplicant first started gambling in casinos in the early 1990s. He filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 1994, though he claims gambling did not contribute to his financial problems \nat that time. (GE 14; Tr. 84-85) He continued to gamble there two-to-three times per year \nuntil approximately 2016, when a local casino opened about a ten-minute drive from \nApplicant\u2019s home. In 2017 Applicant gambled at his local casino at least monthly. He \ntestified that he enjoys playing blackjack. (GE 4 at 99; Tr. 80, 114-115) His personal \nfinancial statement submitted with his May 23, 2023 answers to interrogatories indicated \nApplicant only had a monthly net remainder of $302 after he met his monthly expenses. \n(GE 2 at 34). \nThe record from the local casino established that from 2016 through 2023, \nApplicant incurred approximately $108,070 in gambling losses. (GE 4 at 18-33; GE 5 at \n1-7) Applicant denies these allegations. He offered multiple explanations for the \ndocumented losses. He contended that these losses relate to a \u201cplayers card\u201d that he lost \nand inferred that someone else used his card. (GE 2 at 58) At other times, he claimed \nthat he was just using the casino for check cashing, not gambling. He also stated that the \ncasino incorrectly calculated his losses. (Tr. 45) His explanations lacked credibility. \nRecords from the local casino reveal that in 2016 Applicant lost a total of $10,115; in 2017 \nhe lost a total of $32,973; in 2018 he lost a total of $10,399; in 2019 he lost a total of \n$16,564; in 2020 he lost a total of $17,489; in 2021 he lost a total of $8,293; in 2022 he \nlost a total of $1,583; and in 2023 he lost a total of $10,653. (GE 2, GE 4 at 18-33; GE 5.) \nApplicant appears to have funded his gambling through credit card advances, \nborrowing money, and writing bad checks. For instance, in June of 2017, he made \ncharges totaling $4,280 on a credit card from a credit union at his local casino. In January \n2018 he made another $107 charge on the same credit card at the same casino.

In his response to the first set of interrogatories, \nhe documented that he took a $29,654 withdrawal from his tax deferred annuity plan. (GE \n2 at 68-69, Tr. 124-126) He satisfied these three debts in May 2022 with that early \nwithdrawal. (GE 3 at 11, GE 8 at 2; GE 9; GE 13; GE 15; GE 17; AE H) \nWith respect to the debt identified in SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant incurred the $5,463 debt \nby taking cash advances on his credit card at the local casino. Those two charges \ncomprised about 75% of all charges Applicant made to that credit card ($4,280 of the \n$5,463). (GE 2; GE 4; GE 5; GE 8; GE 9; GE 10; Tr. 116-117, 122) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f: Applicant was delinquent in the amounts of $10,187 and \n$2,150 on charged-off credit cards. He satisfied these debts in July 2021 for \u201cless than \nthe full balance.\u201d (GE 3 at 13, 18; GE 9; GE 11 at 4; GE 13; GE 15; GE 17) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: Applicant is indebted on a collection account placed for collections in \nApril 2020 for the amount of $1,409. As of September 2024, this debt remained \nunresolved. (GE 2 at 26; GE 9; GE 13; GE 17) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: Applicant was indebted on a returned check in the amount of $1,220, \nwhich he believes was likely written to his local casino. This debt was charged off in \nSeptember 2018. Appellant settled it in full in May 2023. (GE 2 at 26, 63; GE 9; AE D; AE \nH, Tr. 102-105) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 2.f: Applicant was indebted on a worthless check written to a \ncasino in a neighboring state around 2013 or 2014, in the amount of $250. He incurred \nan additional $35 fee as a result of the check bouncing. Applicant claimed that he did not \nuse the money obtained to gamble. This $285 debt was settled in full on May 15, 2023. \n(GE 2 at 61; GE 9; AE H; Tr. 92-100) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: Applicant is indebted to a creditor on a default judgment against him \nrecorded in March 2023 in the amount of $1,674 plus 6% interest. This debt was for a \n$1,786 loan he received in May 2017. The loan carried with it a $1,667 finance charge \nand had an interest rate of 29.8%. Applicant agreed to repay the loan through 59 \npayments of $57.57 each, beginning June 15, 2017. However, it has been delinquent \nsince November 2018. This debt remains unresolved. (GE 6; GE 13) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and: Applicant was indebted on an August 2007 judgment against him \nin the amount of $3,200 for a $3,000 worthless check issued in September 2006 used for \na line of credit at a casino. Applicant testified that he used $500 of this money to gamble \nand the rest to travel to a foreign country. This judgment was satisfied in May 2023.

On the SOR, Applicant was alleged \nto have deliberately provided false information in section 26 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to \nthe questions regarding: \u201cHave you EVER experienced financial problems due to \ngambling?\u201d and whether in the past seven years he had defaulted on any loan; had bills \nplaced for collections; had a charged off account or credit card; had been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt; or were currently 120 days delinquent on any debt. Applicant \nclaimed in his answer to the SOR and at hearing that he had not engaged in the amount \nof gambling attributed to him, despite the evidence to the contrary from his local casino. \nHe also explained that he made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d answering \u201cno\u201d to the rest of the \nfinancial questions because he interpreted the question to be asking for a \u201cyes\u201d only if all \nfinancial problems itemized in the list applied. He noted that English is not his first \nlanguage. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 167-170) \nOn May 12, 2020, Applicant met with an authorized investigator for the Department \nof Defense. The investigator questioned Applicant about his debts, his omissions from his \nSCA, and his gambling transactions. Applicant reviewed the record of that interview, \ncorrected errors, and affirmed the statement on May 23, 2023. With respect to Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to list his debts in section 26 on the SCA, Applicant told the investigator he was \nsurprised to know these accounts were not listed as he thought to the best of his \nknowledge that he listed these accounts and that they must have been deleted when he \nverified the form. (GE 2; Tr. 170-180) That explanation is inconsistent with the explanation \nhe offered in his answer to the SOR and during the hearing. \nDuring the interview, Applicant attributed his financial problems to supporting his \n70-year-old brother during a two-month hospitalization. (GE 2 at 12-15; AE C) Records \nreflect that he spent approximately $2,794 assisting his brother between 2018 and 2022. \n(GE 4 at 47-49; AE C; AE E; AE N) Records also reflect that approximately $4,280 of the \n$5,463 debt set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.e was for cash advances at a casino, and there is no \nevidence that those funds were used to help his \u201cterminally ill brother\u201d as he claimed to \nthe investigator when he spoke about this specific debt. (GE 2 at 14.) Additionally, \nApplicant reported to the investigator that he paid the debt identified in SOR \u00b6 1.j, above, \nhowever it remains unresolved. (GE 2 at 13.) \nIn January 2024, Applicant completed another set of interrogatories. In his \nanswers, he disclosed that he last gambled in October 2023. At the hearing he testified \nthat he last gambled in December 2023. (GE 4 at 40; Tr. 186) \n5 \n \nApplicant is highly valued by his employer\u2019s Chief Security Officer, who wrote a \nletter of support and testified on Appellant\u2019s behalf. He indicated that Applicant is \n\u201cexceptional in all aspects of his job\u201d and is \u201cloyal, honest, compassionate, and he is a \nman of great integrity.\u201d (AE J; AE L) The witness detailed numerous examples of how \nApplicant went to great lengths to do anything the company needed during COVID.

He also included a note of thanks he \nreceived for volunteer work. (AE L) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. At 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. The \ndisqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts. \nThe SOR alleges, and the credit reports substantiate, a series of delinquent debts \nthat Applicant incurred since 2006. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j remain unresolved. While the \ndocumented eight delinquencies have been resolved, his history of indebtedness is linked \nto his borrowing money at casinos to fund gambling. His claims that his financial problems \nwere related to his brother\u2019s medical care are not credible. AG \u00b6 19(c) and AG \u00b6 19(h) \napply to Applicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non in the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment:  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Applicant does \nnot acknowledge that his gambling is problematic. Further, he did not appear to have a \nplan to repay his two remaining delinquent accounts or to stay out of debt in the future. \nHis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment remain questionable. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant appears to have assisted his brother \nwith $2,794 in support during an illness. However, his $108,070 in gambling losses were \nnot beyond his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant presented no evidence that he has \nparticipated in financial or gambling counseling. Further, there are no clear indications \nthat his problem is being resolved or is under control. Applicant denies he has a gambling \nproblem. Until his acknowledges he has a problem, he is unlikely to get meaningful help. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, in as \nmuch as those debts have been resolved. However, the concerns about those debts \nexpressed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.m are not mitigated by their resolution because there \nis no indication that Applicant\u2019s underlying problem with gambling has been resolved. \nFurther there is no evidence that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j have been addressed \nin good faith. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e)(1) apply. The evidence establishes that Applicant \nshould have answered \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cHave you EVER experienced financial problems due to \ngambling?\u201d and, whether in the past seven years he had defaulted on any loan; had bills \nplaced for collections; had a charged off account or credit card; had been over 120 days \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelinquent on any debt; or were currently 120 days delinquent on any debt. His \nexplanations as to why he indicated \u201cno\u201d were not credible. He deliberately concealed his \nfinancial debts over 120 days delinquent because they were related to his gambling. He \ncontinued to conceal his financial problems due to his gambling when he told the \ninvestigator for DCSA that his debt was attributable to supporting his brother during his \nillness and that a still-delinquent debt was satisfied. Applicant\u2019s extensive conflicting \nexplanations about his gambling create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. His habit of obscuring the facts about his gambling indicate his problem gambling, \nif known, could affect his personal, professional, or community standing. Additionally, his \njudgment in issuing worthless checks to casinos in 2006 and 2013, continues to be of \nconcern, given his lengthy history of gambling and financial delinquencies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are fully applicable. Applicant has failed \nto admit his lack of veracity on his SCA and with the investigator. Despite being confronted \nby substantiated records of his gambling losses, he continued to deny he had engaged \nin problem gambling. His gambling history and his lack of veracity with respect to \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngambling continue to raise questions about his judgment. While he claimed that he has \nnot gambled since December 2023, his claim holds little weight because of his history of \ndeliberately concealing his financial problems and gambling. Further, in answering \ninterrogatories in January 2024, he claimed that he last gambled in October 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s intentional deception surrounding his financial delinquencies and gambling \npractices is not minor or infrequent. He has not reduced his vulnerability to potential \ncoercion. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts and personal conduct surrounding his gambling. \nDespite resolving eight of his ten debts, Applicant\u2019s gambling practices and false \nstatements about those practices remain a concern. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b, 1.g,1.j, and 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c-1.f, 1.h-1.i, 1.k, and 1.l: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Her medical records confirm several specific conditions, including \ndegeneration of cervical intervertebral disc; inflammation of hip joint; restless leg \nsyndrome; spinal stenosis; cervical spinal stenosis; cervical spondylosis; and insomnia. \nTreatments generally partially worked or worked for limited periods, thus motivating her \nto move to a different specialist. She was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a \ncondition for which pain is the principal symptom, and she is successfully being treated \nfor it. (GE 2 at 2, 4; AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. at 24-27) \nA non-physician friend of a friend advised Applicant that marijuana would help her \ndiminish her pain. (Tr. at 23) In early April 2021, with knowledge of her employer\u2019s no-\ndrug policy and the illegality of marijuana use under federal law, Applicant purchased \n$100 worth of marijuana from another friend (Tr. at 26, 31-32) \u2013 whom she initially chose \nnot to identify. \nApplicant\u2019s first marijuana use consisted of smoking a quarter of a marijuana \ncigarette and consuming two shots of whiskey or rum mixed with something with two \nfriends in her garage shortly before going to bed. (Tr. at 34) She received immediate pain \nrelief from that first use, which lasted around three hours and allowed her to sleep without \npain. As a result of its effectiveness, she increased the frequency of her combined alcohol \nand marijuana use (with her friends) from once during the first week of her marijuana use \nto four times per week \u2013 for a total of eight or nine times \u2013 by the time she underwent the \ndrug test later in April 2021. (Tr. at 37) Upon being notified informed her supervisor about \nher marijuana use. She ceased using marijuana. (GE 2 at 3) She no longer associates \nwith her former marijuana-using friends. (Tr. at 34-35) She intends to avoid marijuana as \nlong as it is federally illegal. (Tr. at 46) \nSince her positive drug test in April 2021, Applicant has subsequently routinely \nbeen randomly tested by her employer in July 2021, October 2021, January 2022, April \n2022, and January 2024. All such tests were negative for marijuana or other illegal \nsubstances. (AE G; AE H) \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on November 15, 2021. She indicated that she was embarrassed \nabout using marijuana but explained that she was in such pain that she took the risk to \ndo so. She realized that the instant relief was not worth it. (GE 2 at 3) She disclosed her \nhistory of chronic pain and her efforts to eliminate or at least reduce it. During and after \nthe hearing she remained completely candid and repentant about what she calls a \u201cbad \ndecision.\u201d (AE F) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve her manner and deportment, appraise the way in which she responded to \nquestions, assess her candor or evasiveness, read her statements, and listen to her \ntestimony. It is my impression that her explanations regarding her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse are consistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(f)  any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2011. On April 16, 2021, she tested \npositive for marijuana. She admittedly used marijuana several times during the first half \nof April 2021 to eliminate or reduce her chronic pain. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(f) have \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Applicant has a history of chronic pain in various \nparts of her body. To address her pain, she sought the professional services of a variety \nof medical specialists who independently treated her for several diagnosed medical \nconditions. They prescribed medications, gave her acupuncture, injections and ablations, \nor did chiropractic adjustments. Nothing really worked except partially or for limited \nperiods, thus motivating her to move to a different specialist. She has several confirmed \nconditions, including degeneration of cervical intervertebral disc; inflammation of hip joint; \nrestless leg syndrome; spinal stenosis; cervical spinal stenosis; cervical spondylosis; and \ninsomnia. She recently reported that she has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a \ncondition for which pain is a principal symptom, and she is successfully being treated for \nit. However, because none of her prior treatments permanently alleviated her chronic \npain, desperate for relief, she accepted the advice of someone who suggested marijuana \nas a pain countermeasure. She obtained relief from her chronic pain during the brief two-\nweek period in April 2021 when she smoked marijuana. She immediately reported her \nmarijuana use to her supervisor upon being advised that she was required to submit to a \nrandom drug test. She never used marijuana again and does not plan to do so, so long \nas it is federally illegal. \nApplicant has been abstinent since April 16, 2021 \u2013 nearly three years. She \nacknowledged that what she did was foolish even though the marijuana did diminish her \npain. She has been candid about her marijuana use, disassociated from those with whom \nshe used the marijuana, and pledged to abstain in the future. I conclude that the drug-\nrelated events of early April 2021 were nothing more than aberrant behavior by her. She \ndid not use marijuana for recreational purposes. She used it briefly to self-medicate when \nher prior medical treatments had already failed to permanently alleviate her chronic pain. \nApplicant\u2019s actions no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c) and \u00b6 2(d). After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant proffered \nsubstantial mitigating evidence, which was more than sufficient to overcome the \ndisqualifying conditions established under Guideline H. \nApplicant acknowledges that what she did was foolish even though the marijuana \ndid diminish her chronic pain. She has been candid about her marijuana use, \ndisassociated from those with whom she used the marijuana, pledged to abstain in the \nfuture, and promised to do anything to keep her clearance and her job. Her drug-related \nevents of early April 2021 \u2013 nearly three years ago \u2013 were nothing more than aberrant \nbehavior by a person desperate to relieve her chronic pain. She did not use marijuana for \nrecreational purposes but did use it briefly to self-medicate when all prior medical \ntreatment had already failed her. She has been abstinent since April 16, 2021. Although \nher actions were a serious breach of her fiduciary duties while holding a security \nclearance, Applicant\u2019s relatively brief period of such actions of early April 2021 \u2013 which \nshe immediately ceased \u2013 no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from her drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nOctober 22, 2022. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2023. On July 28. 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled to be conducted at DOHA\u2019s offices in Arlington, VA, on August 31, 2023. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted nine exhibits marked \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were admitted without objection. I left the \nrecord open until October 20, 2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. \nHe did not submit any additional documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 12, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 58 years old, married since 1994, and has two sons, ages 26 and 23. \nThey are college graduates. The oldest lives out of state, and the youngest lives at home. \nApplicant is a college graduate. He has worked for his current employer since February \n2020. He holds a Top Secret clearance. (Tr. 31-34, 101.) \nUnder Guideline F, the September 6, 2022 SOR alleged that Applicant: (a) failed \nto timely file his federal income tax returns for tax year 2015; (b) failed to timely file his \nstate income tax return for tax year 2015; (c) is indebted to the federal government for \ndelinquent taxes in the amount of $79,889 for tax year 2017; (d) is indebted to the state \nfor delinquent taxes in the amount of $17,412 for tax year 2017, and; (e) is indebted to \nthe state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $10,737 for tax year 2020. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.e.) He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e.) \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.a, his failure to timely file his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2015. (Tr. 36.) He was directed to GE 1, pages 34 and 35, which \nasked whether in the last seven years he had failed to file federal taxes. He responded \n\u201cyes\u201d to that question and was asked if that was accurate. He said he filed for an extension \nfor 2015 and affirmed that he was on a business trip that lasted six months. He did not \ntravel out of the country, but the project had 13 sites around the country in a variety of \nstates. He \u201ctraveled consistently.\u201d As a result of those commitments and the necessary \ntravel, he filed for an extension on the deadline, April 15, 2016. He then \u201cforgot about\u201d \nfiling his return at the extended time. (Tr. 34-41.) \nAE F was marked and admitted into evidence. AE F is an IRS Account Transcript \nfor tax year 2015. AE F shows that on April 15, 2016, Applicant filed an extension of time \nto file his 2016 tax return and made a payment of $1,000. (Tr. 42-44.) AE F showed he \nwas granted an extension to file until October 15, 2016. He was asked when he filed his \n2015 return. His testimony was unclear but that he filed that return later than October \n[2016]. (Tr. 45.) He does not have any paperwork for when he filed his 2015 federal tax \nreturn. Sometime later than October 2016 before 2022, he filed his 2015 return. He did \nnot recall the actual date. (Tr. 49-50) His Answer stated that SOR \u00b6 1.a was \u201cfalse,\u201d but \nhe now testified that it should have been \u201ctrue.\u201d (Tr. 51-52.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.b, his failure to timely file his state income tax \nreturn for tax year 2015. (Tr. 52.) His testimony is \u201cpretty similar\u201d to his testimony about \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, except that he did not request an extension from the state to file his 2015 tax \nreturn, because the state did not request one. (Tr. 52-53.) He filed his 2015 state tax \nreturn the same time he filed his federal tax return for 2015. He was directed to AE B, a \nTurboTax cover sheet, and testified that he filed his 2015 state tax return sometime in \n2021. \u201cIt was definitely late.\u201d His Answer stated that SOR \u00b6 1.b was \u201cfalse,\u201d but he now \ntestified that it should have been \u201ctrue.\u201d (Tr. 54-55.) He does not have any documentation \nto support the exact date that he filed his 2015 state tax return. (Tr. 57.) \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.c, that he is indebted to the federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes in the amount of $79,889 for tax year 2017. (Tr. 57.) \nApplicant explained that he filed the 2017 return \u201cwith the idea of having a side business\u201d \nin 2017. (Tr. 61.) This \u201cside business\u201d was Applicant\u2019s company, Company G. He \npurchased on his own account (actually Company G\u2019s account) equipment, labor, and \nmaterials for the government project his employer had secured. But he was purchasing \nas a 1099 independent subcontractor for his former employer, not as an employee. So \nhe was \u201cfronting\u201d the bill for the equipment and for his and others\u2019 labor. His former \nemployer, now his contractor, was to reimburse him for those costs. \nApplicant was reimbursed \u201cat the last second,\u201d and he in turn paid the laborers, \nand equipment and material suppliers he had hired. When he was reimbursed, his \nemployer, however, mistakenly paid to him individually, as \u201cApplicant\u201d,\u201d not to his \ncompany, \u201cCompany G.\u201d Therefore, it showed up as a \u201cbig cash flow\u201d to him individually \nas an employee, rather than to Company G, a 1099 subcontractor. It looked liked income \npaid to him, but it did not take into account the expenses he (as Company G) incurred as \na subcontractor. That was \u201cwhere the whole mess started.\u201d (Tr. 61-65.) He filed his 2017 \ntax return on time, on April 15, 2018. (Tr. 59-60.)  \nAE G was marked and admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 59.) Applicant \ntestified about AE G, an IRS Account Transcript for tax year 2017, which shows an \nAmended Tax Return filed on January 18, 2023. (Tr. 67.) He received an IRS letter asking \nfor receipts for expenses he claimed in tax year 2017 as a subcontractor. He does not \nhave a copy of that letter. He agreed that AE G states that he owes $87,515 in taxes. (Tr. \n74.) He testified that the amount is incorrect, because it does not account for the expenses \nhe incurred as a subcontractor. \nApplicant pointed to three entries on AE G, page two: (1) \u201cAmended tax return or \nclaim forwarded for processing 01-18-2023;\u201d (2) \u201cAmended tax return filed 01-18-2023;\u201d \nand (3) \u201cBalance due amount currently not collectible \u2013 not due to hardship, 02-22-2023, \n0.00.\u201d He testified that those three entries show that the IRS received the expense \nreceipts he sent it and is still processing them. Once those documents are processed, \nthey will verify that his taxes should be reduced. He believes the $87,515 amount is \nincorrect, because the IRS has not completed its processing. (Tr. 59-71.)

(Tr. 77-80.) As the following discussion will show, it \nappears that the IRS has completed that processing. \nAE H was marked and admitted without objection during the discussion of SOR \u00b6 \n1.d., infra. AE H is an IRS Account Transcript for tax year 2022. There were no questions \nor testimony about that exhibit. (Tr. 85-88.) AE H is, however, relevant to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant was directed to GE 4, page 7, a copy of his Amended Tax Return for tax year \n2017. He agreed that it showed him owing $18,714. He filed this Amended Tax Return in \nNovember 2022. He did not send any money, because the IRS told him he would not owe \nanything. (Tr. 72-74.) AE H shows he filed his 2022 tax return on May 15, 2023, with an \namount due of $18,099. It also shows an amount withheld of $18,101 (for a $2.00 credit). \nAE H shows an ACCOUNT BALANCE PLUS ACCRUALS of 0.00 as of May 15, 2023. \nThose are the most recent relevant IRS entries in the record. It appears that the IRS has \ncorrected his tax liability, and that his federal tax liability has been resolved. \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.d, that he is indebted to the state for delinquent \ntaxes in the amount of $17,412 for tax year 2017. (Tr. 81.) He was directed to GE 4, page \n12, a February 22, 2022 state invoice showing that he owes $17,412. He explained that \nthe new balance is $11,453 (Tr.83.) AE H was marked and admitted into evidence without \nobjection. AE H is an IRS Account Transcript for tax year 2022. (Tr. 85.) AE I was marked \nand admitted into evidence without objection. AE I is a state Notice of Collection Action \ndated December 22, 2022. AE I shows a balance due of $11,453. (Tr. 85-86.) Applicant \nwas asked which tax year AE I refers to. His answers were unclear, but he believes AE I \nrefers to tax years 2015 and 2017. (Tr. 86-87.) He has not made arrangements with the \nstate to pay any of that balance, because \u201c[o]nce the 2017 [federal] is done, [he] should \nnot owe anything.\u201d (Tr. 88.) He produced no documents showing any communications he \nhad with the state about this outstanding balance. \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.e, that he is indebted to the state for delinquent \ntaxes in the amount of $10,737 for tax year 2020. (Tr. 88.) He was directed to GE 4, page \n13, a February 22, 2022 state Notice of Income Tax Assessment. He testified that the \ncurrent status is that State A sent his home state $7,340. He does not have a document \nshowing that. The company he was working for \u201cmessed it up\u201d and sent his taxes to State \nA instead of to his home state. He filled out a form and received a check from State A to \nreimburse him for the taxes that were incorrectly applied. On December 23, 2022, he paid \nhis home state the amount State A reimbursed him. He is \u201csure [he has] something [he] \ncan send [to Department Counsel].\u201d He knows that $2,811 from his last tax return did go \nto his home state. His home state has stopped sending him notice letters, so he believes \nthere is nothing pending. He has not verified that with his home state. (Tr. 90-96.) He \nproduced no documents showing his payment to his home state or any other supporting \ndocuments. \nApplicant testified about his personal finances. He has no liens or judgments \nagainst him. He is current on all federal and state income tax filings. His current net annual \nsalary is $130,000. His spouse earns $36,000 per year. His adult son works but does not \ncontribute to household expenses, because he just graduated from college and is taking \ncare of student loans.(Tr. 96-98.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has two joint checking accounts, one with about $500 and the other \nabout $1,500.

He has not had any financial counseling. He has \nnot been on a vacation in 10 years. (Tr. 98-101.) \nDepartment Counsel asked why Applicant did not file his taxes on time. He \nanswered that: He \u201cthought that because they owed me, that I was okay . . . I was doing \nwell enough at the time where I felt like you know . . . the extra thousand dollars that I \nwas going to get didn\u2019t really matter. And before I knew it, it was multiple years later And \nI got a notice from them, and that\u2019s when I started to work on it.\u201d (Tr. 102-103.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security clearance \ndecision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nApplicant\u2019s failures to file federal and state income tax returns and his failures to pay \nfederal and state income taxes are established by the Government\u2019s case-in-chief. The \nfollowing disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19 applies: \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . .), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b both involve Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2015. The circumstances of those failures were \u201cpretty \nsimilar,\u201d so they can be discussed together. In 2015, he was assigned to a project that \nhad 13 work sites in a number of states around the country. As a result of his frequent \ntravels for that project, he needed to request an extension to file his federal income tax \nreturn. He filed for an extension right at the deadline of April 15, 2016. The same \ncircumstances affected his state income tax return filing, except that he did not request \nan extension from the state. He then forgot about filing his returns.

He testified that they were \u201cdefinitely late.\u201d \nI have considered mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b). Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances occurred at the outset in 2015 and 2016, which is quite a while ago. And \na work assignment of that kind might not recur. As well, that assignment was \u201clargely \nbeyond\u201d his control. Those factors satisfy the initial requirements of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b). He did not, however, rectify his tardy filings until years after they were due. That \nwas not responsible conduct, and it calls into question his reliability. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nare not mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b). \nSOR \u00b61.c alleged that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for \ndelinquent taxes in the amount of $79,889 for tax year 2017. In 2017, he decided to do \nbusiness as an independent subcontractor for his employer, instead of an employee. His \ncompany was called \u201cCompany G,\u201d and using that company he \u201cfronted\u201d the costs of \nequipment, labor, and materials for the project. At the end of the year, he was to be \nreimbursed for those costs. The problem arose when his employer mistakenly reimbursed \nhim in his individual name, \u201cApplicant\u201d instead of paying his company, \u201cCompany G.\u201d \nTherefore, it showed up as a \u201cbig cash flow\u201d to him individually as an employee, not as \nCompany G, a 1099 subcontractor. It looked liked income that was paid to him, but it did \nnot take into account the expenses he (as Company G) incurred as a subcontractor. \nApplicant filed his 2017 tax return on time, on April 15, 2018. He then began the \ntask of submitting to the IRS the back-up documents supporting the expenses he incurred \nwhen his company fronted the costs of labor, materials, and equipment for the project in \n2017. IRS then had to go through the internal process of correcting his tax liability. It was \nnot until he filed his 2022 tax return on May 15, 2023, that his tax status was updated and \ncorrected. He is no longer delinquent. \nI have considered mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b). The significant \nbookkeeping error by Applicant\u2019s employer in reimbursing him as an employee instead of \nas a subcontractor working through his own company was what caused his tax problems. \nThis event happened in 2017 or 2018, quite a long time ago. It was also an unusual \ncircumstance and is unlikely to recur. And it was a factor largely beyond his control. He \nnonetheless filed his 2017 tax return on time and set about working with the IRS to rectify \nhis tax record. This was reliable and responsible conduct, and although it took years, he \nsuccessfully had his tax record corrected in May 2023. SOR \u00b61.c has been mitigated by \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b). \nSOR \u00b61.d alleged that Applicant is indebted to the state for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $17,412 for tax year 2017. His only explanation was that \u201c[o]nce the 2017 \n[federal] is done, [he] should not owe anything.\u201d He produced no documents showing any \ncommunications he had with the state about this outstanding balance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b61.e alleged that Applicant is indebted to the state for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $10,737 for tax year 2020. His explanation was that his employer mistakenly \nsent the withheld taxes to State A instead of to his home state. Applicant filled out a form, \nand State A reimbursed him, and he in turn paid an amount to his home state. He believes \nnothing is pending, but he has not verified that with his home state. He produced no \ndocuments showing his payment to his home state or any other supporting documents. \nApplicant\u2019s responses to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1d and 1.e suffer from the same infirmity. The \nAppeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present \ndocumentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at \n2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2006)). He was given the opportunity to document his explanations, but he did not do so. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1d and 1.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the \nwhole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and in this section in my \nwhole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 39-42, 63) Post-hearing \ndocumentation of the TY 2017 filing reflects that she owes about $1,425. (AE J) She did \nnot provide documentation regarding TY 2018. \nApplicant also acknowledged that her tax returns for TY 2020 and TY 2022 \nremained unfiled. She filed an extension for 2020 but not 2022. She let the tax filings \u201cslip \nthrough the cracks.\u201d She was on a leave of absence for several months in 2022 due to a \ndeath in the family. State 2, where she now lives, does not have a state income tax. (Tr. \n42-46, 63) After the hearing, Applicant also provided copies of her TY 2020 and TY 2022 \nfederal income tax returns. They reflect that she owes about $5,882 and $2,815 in past-\ndue taxes, respectively. (AE K, AE L) Applicant said she had requested payment plans \nfor her unpaid taxes.

It is not clear that any \nof the past-due tax returns have been filed. \nApplicant provided a budget from about July 2023. She noted several of her SOR \ndebts and other revolving debt. She has a loan of about $7,300 against her 401k \nretirement plan at work. Her budget at the time reflects a negative balance and limited if \nany savings. (Tr. 51; AE P) Applicant said she recently moved in with her sister to cut \ndown on rent and other expenses. She said she has about $1,200 left over each month \nafter bills are paid. (Tr. 48-50) Her plan is to settle her debts, repair her credit, and file her \ntax returns. (Tr. 58-59; AE G, AE H) She scheduled an appointment with a credit \ncounselor in early December 2023. (AE O, AE Q) \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that she has several active credit cards, and she \nestimated that she has a combined balance of about $5,000, though she acknowledged \nit could be as high as $30,000. She owes about $66,000 in federal student loans. (GE 4) \nShe has applied for a reduced payment plan now that the loans are being removed from \n(COVID-19 pandemic) forbearance. She has not participated in other credit counseling. \n(Tr. 53-61) \nApplicant submitted reference letters from acquaintances who attested to her \nhonesty, work ethic, and dependability. (AE M, AE N) In her year-end reviews, her \nsupervisors all rate her as \u201c[s]trong,\u201d note that she is making progress in her job, and say \nthat she has an \u201camazing attitude.\u201d (AE R) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter working her way through college, Applicant incurred delinquent debts when \nshe was not able to earn enough income to pay her expenses. She incurred other \ndelinquent debts after moving to a new state in 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nApplicant also failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for TY 2017 and \nTY 2018. These tax years were shortly after she finished her college degree. AG \u00b6 19(f) \napplies to those unfiled returns. Other unfiled returns from later tax years, and any \nresulting tax debt, were not alleged in the SOR, so they cannot be considered \ndisqualifying conduct. However, those matters may be addressed in mitigation, below. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts after college and after moving to a new state \nto be closer to her family. To her immense credit, she worked her way through college \nand earned a degree. She had sporadic employment until beginning her current job in \nFebruary 2020. Her debts, however, are largely ongoing, and continue to cast doubt on \nher current judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are largely due to incurring debt and expenses beyond her \nmeans, without a meaningful plan to address them. She has had recent hardships in her \nfamily, and she had to stop work for several months. She has moved in with family to cut \ndown on expenses, However, she has not yet begun to address her debts in a meaningful \nway. She has retained a debt-relief company to help her settle her debts and is pursuing \ncredit counseling, but she has not yet put a reasonable payment plan in place, and her \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts are not yet being resolved or under control. She has filed most of her past-due tax \nreturns, but those returns suggest that she owes about $10,000 or more in past-due taxes, \nwhich is new debt she has also not yet addressed. Applicant took little action before late \n2023 to address her debts. She needs to establish a track record of payments towards \nher debts to show good faith and responsible action to mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) therefore do not fully apply to mitigate security \nconcerns about her finances. \nApplicant prepared her TY 2017 federal tax return. She said she had filed her TY \n2018 return, but this is not documented in the record. She also had two other late-filed \nreturns, from TY 2020 and TY 2022. Those returns, and any resulting debts, are not \nalleged in the SOR but they undercut any mitigating effect otherwise shown. AG \u00b6 20(g) \nis not established. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate security \nconcerns about her debts and tax issues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant is credited with working her way through college and with \nbeginning a fine career as a financial analyst. She is well-regarded at work and in her \npersonal life. Nevertheless, she did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcern shown by her delinquent debts. This is not to say she will not be able to establish \nher eligibility at a future date. But she needs to establish a reasonable plan for addressing \nher debts and take some concrete steps putting that plan into place. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 \n19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20 (c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established.

AG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. \nApplicant purchased a motorhome, a luxury brand vehicle, and a motorcycle, while \nhaving extensive tax debts and other delinquent financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances and luxury purchases while having numerous unresolved financial \nconcerns raise serious reservations about his judgment and reliability, concerns which \ncannot be successfully mitigated by the debts he has already mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant was evasive in his testimony. While he had a distinguished military \ncareer and letters attesting to his character, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about his financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n         \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n              \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 28, 2020. On \nSeptember 15, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old retired Army veteran. He was honorably discharged in \n2006. He has been married five times and has three adult children. His divorces occurred \nin 1993, 1999, 2001, 2013, and 2020. He was required to pay $571.76 in monthly alimony \nto his fourth wife through November 2022. (Tr. at 43-44.) He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2013 and his master\u2019s degree in 2015. He has worked for a Federal contractor since \n2010. He also worked as an independent contractor from October 2010 to October 2014. \n(Tr. at 46.) He has been in his current position since May 2022. He has experienced brief \nperiods of unemployment when he was between contracts and after retiring from the \nmilitary. (Tr. at 45-46.) The largest period of unemployment for him was three months in \n2015. (Tr. at 29; GE 1.) His most recent security clearance was granted in 2017. (GE 1; \nTr. at 47.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b-1.e:  A June 2018 tax lien by the Federal government for \n$166,567.00 for tax years 2010 through 2016 and delinquent tax debt to the Federal \nGovernment for tax years 2017 through 2020 in the amounts of $8,947, $11,287, \n$7,311, and $10,063 respectively that remains unpaid. Applicant in his security \nclearance application admitted that his taxes were delinquent for tax years 2013 through \n2018. He cited being unable to obtain the appropriate records and that this was during \nthe period he was an independent contractor. (GE 1; Tr. at 48-49.) He did not discover \nthe problem until he switched his limited liability company (LLC) from a 1099 payment to \na W-2. He could not tell \u201cexactly what documents\u201d he was told he was missing at the time. \n(Tr. at 49.) He explained he was \u201cjust relying on whoever filed [his] taxes at the time\u201d and \nwhat they told him for why he did not adjust his tax withholdings. (Tr. at 52.) He went to a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: delinquent state tax debt for tax years 2018 and 2020 in the amount \nof $9,682. Applicant admitted this debt. He testified his wages were garnished for his \ndelinquent state taxes in August 2020, but he was not sure what tax years the \ngarnishment covered. (Tr. 56, 58.) The state tax returns that he provided with his \nsupplemental interrogatory responses indicated he owed state taxes in the amount of \n$8,587 for tax year 2018 and $1,095 for tax year 2020. (Tr. at 58.) He testified TRC2 was \nrepresenting him with regards to SOR \u00b6 1.f and was also negotiating a resolution to the \nstate delinquency. (Tr. at 60; AE A.) TRC2\u2019s letter was issued prior to the SOR \namendments. He offered a payment plan reminder notice from a different company dated \nJuly 12, 2023, stating: \n \n \ntax lawyer to try to get back on track. He testified \u201cI haven't made any federal payments \nsince I want to say 2014, whenever I started with [first tax relief company] (TRC1).\u201d (Tr. \nat 56.) He has been working with the second tax relief company (TRC2) since April 2019. \n(Tr. at 53; AE A.) TRC2 stated it was \u201clegal representing\u201d him with regards to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.e. He acknowledged his security clearance was in jeopardy, which was why he retained \nthe tax relief company to assist him in getting his tax debt down. He did not think it was \nin his best interest to talk to the IRS himself. He testified he was told by his tax relief \ncompany \u201cthe best way forward is to let them negotiate the monies owed\u201d but added \u201cWith \nme doing it on my own I'll probably get the same results that they would get.\u201d (Tr. at 57.) \nHe offered AE X dated June 30, 2023, from TRC3, which announced TRC3\u2019s services \nhad been retained for resolution of IRS tax liabilities. TRC3 stated: \nWe are currently in the process of settling their tax debt and resolving all \ntax matters with the IRS. Please note that [Applicant] is/ are currently in the \nprocess of compliance with all IRS filing and compliance requirements. All \ncollection efforts have been placed on hold due to the pending resolutions. \nYou have received this payment reminder notice to assist you with your \npayment plan related to your debt due for the creditor(s) referenced in the \ndetail section. We have provided a mailing coupon at the bottom of this \nnotice along with a payment remittance envelope. Please detach the \npayment coupon and mail it on or before 08-01-23 with your scheduled \npayment in the amount of $478.84. (AE Y.) \n \nThe reminder notice showed the respective balances due to his state Department of \nTaxation as $3,661.65 and $1,605.56 but does not state the tax years applicable to these \namounts. \nApplicant sought the assistance from two debt-relief companies to address his \nconsumer debt. He enrolled with his current company on April 21, 2022, and the debt- \nrelief company reported he had a total debt of $60,899 enrolled. He has been making \n$862 monthly payments to this debt-relief company. (AE C.) He provided exhibits showing \nthat he had addressed and resolved debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.n, and \n1.p, and he testified to the unresolved debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.l, and 1.m, which became \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelinquent between 2018 and 2019 during the breakup of his fifth marriage.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 \n19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20 (c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s $166,567 Federal tax lien for tax \nyears 2010 through 2016 and state tax debt of $9,682 for tax years 2018 and 2020 are \nunresolved, which casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment and he was placed on notice of these concerns ten years ago in a previous \nSOR. He presented evidence that he resolved six accounts totaling nearly $13,300, which \nincluded an account in the amount of $9,653 and five other accounts totaling $3,640 and \nhad been working with a debt relief company on one not resolved \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant did experience multiple divorces in \nthe last ten years. He does support his testimony that he paid certain debts and has \noffered to resolve others. AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances.\u201d He has not made any payments or engaged the IRS regarding his \ndelinquent taxes since 2014. His intentions to resolve financial problems, specifically his \ntax debts, in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other \nresponsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere have been no direct payments made towards four consumer accounts totaling \nnearly $52,000. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant testified he received financial \ncounseling for his financial problems when he enrolled his debts with the debt relief \ncompany. He did not offer any documentation of his successful completion of these \ncourses from a legitimate and credible source. The record does reflect that the consumer \ndebt problem is being resolved by his employment of a debt relief company and there is \nevidence of his timely monthly payments on his motor home, vehicle loan, and motorcycle \nloan. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has a $166,567 tax lien for delinquent \ntaxes from 2010 through 2016. He owes delinquent Federal taxes totaling $37,608 for tax \nyears 2017 through 2020. He owes delinquent state taxes totaling $9,682 for tax years \n2018 and 2020. He has failed to pay his taxes as required from 2010 to 2020 and \namassed delinquent taxes totaling nearly $214,000. Aside from garnishment, he provided \nevidence of one payment, which pertained to his state tax debt, otherwise he has not \nmade any payments on his delinquent taxes alleged in the SOR. While there is some \nevidence he has made arrangements regarding paying his state tax debt, the evidence is \ninsufficient regarding his compliance with those arrangements. He blames inadvertent \nmistakes on his tax returns while operating as an independent contractor for a few years \nbefore becoming a salaried employee does not address the number of years in question. \nHe has not initiated a payment plan with the IRS and has been relying on tax relief firms \nto try and negotiate a settlement. After eight years of working with different tax relief firms \nhe has not resolved any delinquent tax account.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d Good faith \n\u201crequires a showing that a person acted in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). AG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. \nApplicant purchased a motorhome, a luxury brand vehicle, and a motorcycle, while \nhaving extensive tax debts and other delinquent financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances and luxury purchases while having numerous unresolved financial \nconcerns raise serious reservations about his judgment and reliability, concerns which \ncannot be successfully mitigated by the debts he has already mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nApplicant was evasive in his testimony. While he had a distinguished military \ncareer and letters attesting to his character, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about his financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                    Subparagraphs 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.p:        For Applicant \n                    Subparagraphs 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o: \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant testified on his \nown behalf, and I found his testimony to be credible. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 In May 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with abuse of a \nfamily member and household members, and a temporary restraining order (TRO) was \nentered again him. The complainant was Applicant\u2019s first wife. The charge was initially \ndismissed without prejudice and later dismissed with prejudice. (Tr. 39-43; GE 2, GE 5, \nAE A, AE F) Applicant was not required to attend domestic violence counseling \nfollowing this arrest. (Tr. 79-80) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 In July 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with abuse of \nfamily and household members. The complainant was Applicant\u2019s second wife. (Tr. 50\u00ad\n51, 57-59) The charge was dismissed with prejudice for lack of evidence. (Tr. 103; AE \nA) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 In February 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with a \ndomestic violence crime and a TRO was entered against him. Again, the complainant \nwas Applicant\u2019s second wife. (Tr. 52, 59; GE 6; AE E). The charge was dismissed with \nprejudice, as in the two previous cases, because his former spouse failed to appear. \n(Tr. 60, 101; AE A) \nAll three arrests were subsequently expunged, and the records of arrest were \nannulled. The State\u2019s Attorney General issued Applicant expungement certificates. The \ncertificates authorized Applicant to state in response to any question or inquiry, whether \nor not under oath, that he had no record regarding these arrests. Applicant testified that \nhis case was dismissed because his former spouses failed to appear and added, \u201c[y]es, \n[a]nd I just didn\u2019t do the crime.\u201d (Tr. 43-44, 49-50, 79-83, 101-102; 103, GE 1, GE 8; AE \nA, AE C, AE D) \nFollowing his TRO hearing in February 2020, Applicant volunteered to attend \ndomestic violence classes. He did so for the duration of the active restraining order. \nThese classes were online and consisted of sharing experiences with other people and \nteaching different approaches to communicating with one\u2019s spouse. In August 2020, \nApplicant\u2019s TRO was dismissed, and he stopped taking the online classes. (Tr. 49-50, \n79-83, 101-102; GE 1, GE 8) \nApplicant reiterated the reason the domestic violence charges/TRO petitions \nwere dismissed in all three cases was because neither of his wives appeared in court \nbecause \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any proof that [he] actually did these (offenses).\u201d He added that \nhe was never abusive to either of his wives.

(Tr. 70-74, 76-78; AE C, AE B) \nDuring the timeframe of August 2017 to December 2017, Applicant consulted a \npsychiatrist at the VA for stress related to his 2017 divorce. Applicant does not recall \nbeing given a diagnosis but was provided medication to help him sleep that he no \nlonger takes. At the time of his hearing, Applicant was seeing a psychologist on an as-\nneeded basis to help him cope with depression following his divorces. (Tr. 47-49, 101; \nGE 1) \nApplicant asserts that he is a law-abiding citizen who respects the law. He added \nthat he is a ten-year Army veteran who lived by Army core values of loyalty, duty, \nselfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. He acknowledges making poor \nchoices in his personal life but is not a threat to national security. He considers himself a \npatriot and loves his country. (Tr. 102; AE A) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to\naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt\non the individual's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence establishes possible concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and \n31(b). Further inquiry is required to determine the applicability of mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns in \nthis case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Personal Conduct \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nA review of the facts supports partial application of AG \u00b6 32(a) and full \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(c) and 32(d). The earliest 2017 incident occurred six years \nbefore Applicant\u2019s hearing, and the latest 2020 incident occurred three years before his \nhearing. Applicant presented evidence that undermined the validity of the three charges \nalleged against him. With regard to the first charge, his first wife failed to appear, and \nthe case was dismissed with prejudice. With regard to the second and third charges, his \nsecond wife failed to appear, and the cases were dismissed with prejudice. \nApplicant received expungement orders for all three charges. Notably, Applicant \napplied for and received an eight-year restraining order against his second wife. This is \nquite an extraordinary outcome in today\u2019s environment. The trial judge had an \nopportunity to review the case file and assess the credibility of the respective parties \nbefore granting such a lengthy restraining order. No such similar order was entered \nagainst Applicant. Apart from these allegations, there is no record evidence that \nApplicant has engaged in violence or is a violent person. Absent corroboration beyond \nwhat is available in the record, there is not reliable evidence to support a finding that the \nallegations occurred as alleged. In short, Applicant refuted the allegations. \nAdditionally, Applicant sought counseling in 2017 for stress related to his first \ndivorce, and at the time of his hearing he was receiving counseling on an as-needed \nbasis to cope with depression following his divorces. In the midst off all of the domestic \nturmoil he was experiencing, he managed to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2019, and at the time of his hearing he was working on his Ph.D. \nSince he was released from active duty in the Army in 2017, he has been gainfully \nemployed as a defense contractor. \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \nThe record evidence establishes possible concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c). Further \ninquiry is required to determine the applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe SOR cross-alleged the three Guideline J allegations under this concern. \nGuideline J is the most appropriate guideline for Applicant\u2019s conduct. AG \u00b6 17 provides \nconditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur; \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) partially apply, as does AG \u00b6 17(c) because the alleged \nmisconduct would have occurred under unique circumstances as Applicant is no longer \nmarried, and domestic violence is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies for the \nreasons discussed under the criminal conduct analysis, supra. Applicant fully mitigated \nsecurity concerns under this guideline. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines J and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old cyber operations lead analyst employed by a defense \ncontractor since September 2022. He enlisted in the U.S. Army right after graduating \nfrom high school. He honorably served on active duty from 2009 to 2017, and in the \nArmy Reserve from 2017 to 2020. He was subsequently awarded a 100% VA disability \nrating as a result of injuries sustained on active duty. Since his release from active duty, \nhe has worked exclusively for defense contractors. He successfully held Secret and Top \nSecret clearances while he was in the Army, and he currently holds a TS/SCI \nClearance as a defense contractor. He has diligently pursued higher education as \ndiscussed, supra, and was working to complete his Ph.D. at the time of his hearing. \nApart from his professional development and accomplishments, Applicant \nencountered significant disappointments in his personal life, notably his two divorces. \nHis first spouse leveled a domestic violence charge against him in 2017, and his second \nspouse leveled domestic violence charges against him in 2019 and 2020. Neither \nspouse appeared at any of the scheduled hearings. All three charges were dismissed \nwith prejudice, and Applicant received judicial expungement orders for all three of those \ncharges. Applicant stated that his spouses failed to appear because they were unable to \nprove the charges they filed against him. \nAs noted, I found Applicant to be credible. He was consistent in his recollection of \nevents and did not waiver or hedge in his testimony. I did not have the option of \nevaluating any of the complainants\u2019 testimony. As such, I was limited in reaching my \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ncredibility assessment based on the record evidence, which not only included \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, but included evidence of the expungement of all charges and an \neight-year restraining order filed against Applicant\u2019s second spouse. I also note that \nApplicant initiated divorce proceedings against both of his spouses, versus the other \nway around. He said neither spouse wanted a divorce. Applicant is also credited with \nseeking counseling on his own volition to cope with the disappointment from two failed \nmarriages. I have also taken into account Applicant\u2019s military service, his service-\nconnected disabilities, and his successful employment as a defense contractor. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 \n(1991). Applicant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to overcome the Dorfmont presumption with \nrespect to the security concerns alleged in the SOR.   \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nApplicant mitigated the Guidelines J and E security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. National security eligibility is \ngranted. \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

This generates a security \nconcern that he failed to mitigate. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 9, 2022, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline D, sexual behavior, and Guideline \nE, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the CAS was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance eligibility. \nThe CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nOn February 3, 2023, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting SOR \u00b6 1.a and \ndenying SOR \u00b6 2.a. In addition, he requested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned \nto me on July 18, 2023. On September 8, 2023, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the case \nfor October 26, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled. I admitted six government \nexhibits (GE), incorporated into the record as GE 1 through GE 6; six Applicant Exhibits \n(AE), incorporated into the record as AE A through AE F; and the testimony of Applicant \nand two character witnesses. At the close of the hearing, I left the record open, at \nApplicant\u2019s request, to allow him to submit additional documents. Within the time allotted, \nhe submitted three exhibits, identified as AE G to AE I. Department Counsel did not object, \nand I incorporated them into the record. The transcript was received on November 2, 2023. \nPreliminary Rulings \nAt the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR, to add \nanother allegation under Paragraph 1, as follows: \n1.b. From about 2016 to at least 2021, you have had intrusive thoughts about \nunderage girls and children, to include thoughts of what their genitals look \nlike underneath their clothes, thoughts of abducting underage females, and \nthoughts of having sex with underage females. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected, raising notice and due process issues. Alternatively, \nhe argued that if I granted the motion to amend, that the allegation should be set forth \nunder a separate paragraph for psychological conditions and that the record be re-opened \nto allow Applicant\u2019s treatment team to provide medical updates. (Tr. 165-169) I reserved \njudgment on Department Counsel\u2019s motion and Applicant\u2019s counter-motion. Instead, I \nextended the record to November 30, 2023, to allow Applicant\u2019s counsel an opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence and to ascertain at that point if the parties still wanted to \ncontinue with their motions. (Tr. 168-169) Within the time allotted, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nsubmitted AE G through AE I, as noted above. After reviewing the new exhibits, \nDepartment Counsel, on December 8, 2023, renewed his motion to amend, together with a \nbrief in support thereof. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) On December 12, 2023, Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel filed a response to Department Counsel\u2019s motion, renewing his objection, and \nrenewing his request for a second hearing to consider the proposed amended allegation \nunder a Guideline I paragraph. \nUpon considering both motions, I have decided to deny Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion to amend the SOR. Secondly, because Applicant\u2019s motion to re-open the hearing is \nnow moot, I hereby deny that motion, also. In denying Department Counsel\u2019s motion, \nhowever, I am not excluding the facts from consideration. Specifically, the facts at issue are \nnot controverted because Applicant readily admitted them during the hearing, and \nApplicant\u2019s intrusive thoughts were discussed by Applicant\u2019s psychologist in a report \nattached to his SOR answer, and in an updated, post-hearing report. (Answer, Enclosure \n(Enc.) 5; AE G) Moreover, regardless of whether it is set forth as a stand-alone allegation in \nthe SOR, it constitutes relevant evidence for multiple reasons, including: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1) evaluating the credibility of Applicant\u2019s contention that he watched child \npornography inadvertently; \n2) evaluating the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s decision to watch \nchild pornography; \n3) evaluating the status of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation efforts; and \n4) assessing the likelihood of whether Applicant may view child pornography \nin the future. \n2. SOR subparagraph 2.a reads, as follows: \nYou falsified a material fact on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), executed by you on August 7, 2018, when you wrote in \nthe \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section that you were \u201cprobed by the FBI in \nNovember/December 2018 in relation to an unspecified mental health \ncondition.\u201d  In fact, you were interviewed by the FBI in November/December \n2018 to address your admission to viewing child pornography made during \nyour July 2018 interview with the [government agency].  \nThe only e-QIP on file is dated August 7, 2019, not August 7, 2018. (GE 1) Applicant \nin his answer, corrected the date and provided an explanation based on the actual e-QIP \ndate, not the mistaken one as DOHA drafted. Consequently, I am amending SOR \nsubparagraph 2.a sua sponte, striking \u201cAugust 7, 2018,\u201d and replacing it with \u201cAugust 7, \n2019.\u201d \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old single man.

His duties include developing \nsimulations, sensors, and user interfaces for weapons systems. (Answer at 10) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to a coworker, he performs all \nhis duties with quality and integrity. (Answer, Enclosure (Enc.) 6 at 1) According to another \ncoworker, he is an amazing resource to go to for help, who \u201cwould . . . often give in depth \nexplanations about how . . . software worked to any employee who showed interest and \nwanted to learn.\u201d (Answer, Enc. 6 at 7) According to his supervisor, he provides excellent \ntechnical support and \u201cis a tremendous asset upon which the government [can] call upon.\u201d \n(Answer, Enc. 6 at 11) \nApplicant viewed pornography approximately once every other day between July \n2015 and January 2017.

(GE 3 at 6; Tr. 61, 113, 118) Applicant contends that \nhe came across these images inadvertently while browsing adult pornography. (Tr. 55-56, \n64) \nFrom approximately 2016 to 2018, Applicant sometimes browsed the Facebook \npages of his friends to see if they posted swimsuit pictures or other family photos of their \ndaughters. The age of these girls ranged from 13 to 16. (GE 3 at 7) Such pictures aroused \nhim. (GE 3 at 7) On one occasion, he ran into a former teacher and the teacher\u2019s family at \nchurch and fantasized about how one of his daughters would look underneath her clothing. \n(Tr. 69) \nAt times while running errands at the neighborhood shopping center, Applicant \nwould see children and fantasize about how they looked under their clothing. (Tr. 138) This \noccurred most recently in 2021. During an interview with an FBI investigator in November \n2018, that Applicant underwent related to a security clearance investigation of another \nagency, he admitted that he had at times fantasized about abducting children from \u201ca place \nlike a Stop and Shop or whatnot . . .\u201d (GE 4 at 6; Tr. 132, 135-138) These thoughts \nincreased when he viewed child pornography. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 68) He testified that none of \nthese thoughts ever led to any concrete plan to harm children. Rather, they were \nhypothetical. (Tr. 70) \nRecognizing the severity of this problem, Applicant, shortly after the November 2018 \nFBI interview, began working with a therapist to address these thoughts. (Tr. 72) With the \nhelp of his therapist, these thoughts gradually began decreasing. The record contains \ntherapist\u2019s notes of Applicant\u2019s counseling between 2020 and 2023. (AE C; Answer, Enc. 5 \nat 5; Tr. 85; AE I) The therapist helps him \u201creframe his intrusive thoughts\u201d (Tr. 86) by \nthinking about something like an old family memory whenever he catches himself thinking \nabout an underage female. (Tr. 95) Applicant has not had any intrusive thoughts since \n2021. (Tr.  93) \nApplicant also has been receiving treatment from a psychiatrist once every other \nmonth since 2020. (Tr. 84, 86) She prescribed Applicant an anxiety medication that has \nhelped limit his intrusive thoughts. (Tr. 85) \nIn September 2022, a psychologist evaluated Applicant in relation to his fitness to \npossess a security clearance. After interviewing Applicant, he concluded that Applicant \nmore likely than not never looked at child pornography, and instead, probably saw adult \nmodels on legal websites who were made to appear young, and that Applicant reported \nthem as minors in an abundance of caution. (Answer, Enc. 5 at 10) The psychologist\u2019s \nconclusion was based in part on Applicant\u2019s characterization that he watched the child \npornography inadvertently. (Answer, Enc. 5 at 2) Furthermore, he noted that reporting that \npornography models are underage under the stress of a polygraph, like Applicant \nexperienced, was a phenomenon not uncommon with security clearance applicants. \n(Answer, Enc. 5 at 10) Applicant testified that he was confident that some of the females he \nviewed in the pornography images and videos were underage. (Tr. 118) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs for Applicant\u2019s fantasizing about girls, the psychologist who evaluated him in \nSeptember 2022 explained that this was indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) \nrather than any pedophilic interests. (Answer, Enc. 5 at 11) One of the symptoms of OCD is \nrepetitive, unpleasant sexual thoughts, such as those that Applicant occasionally \nexperiences. (Answer, Enc. 5 at 11) Per the psychologist, \u201cthe very fact that [Applicant \nfinds] the images repulsive is what causes them to be experienced mentally as part of an \nanxiety disorder,\u201d as opposed to any urge to sexually exploit or otherwise harm children. \n(Answer, Enc. 5 at 10) The psychologist explained that this is why the medication, which his \npsychiatrist prescribed earlier, helped reduce his intrusive thoughts. The psychologist \nevaluated Applicant again in 2023 and reiterated his conclusions. (AE G at 11) \nIn early 2023, Applicant began attending Sexaholics Anonymous (SA), \u201ca fellowship \nwith a solution to the problems of lust, sex, and pornography addiction.\u201d (AE D; Answer at \n7; Tr. 88) He attends phone meetings approximately once a week. (Tr. 89-90) \nSubparagraph 2.a of the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his August 2019 \nsecurity clearance application in the \u201cadditional comments\u201d section by disclosing an FBI \ninvestigation but characterizing the subject of the probe as being for \u201can unspecified mental \nhealth condition,\u201d rather than for suspicion of viewing child pornography. (GE 1 at 30) The \n\u201cadditional comments\u201d section of the security clearance application invites applicants \u201cto \nprovide any information [they] would like to add.\u201d(GE 1 at 30) Applicant elaborated about \nthe FBI investigation, providing the approximate date, and noting that [he] was extremely \nup front throughout the process,\u201d and that he had been seeking help from a qualified \nmedical professional related to issues of concern in the investigation. (GE 1 at 30) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior:  \nThis guideline concerns \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a \nlack of judgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.\u201d (AG \u00b6 12) Applicant viewed child pornography between July 2015 \nand 2017 on multiple occasions. He contends that he inadvertently came across child \npornography that flashed across the screen of otherwise legal adult pornography that he \nwas viewing. Given Applicant\u2019s testimony that he sometimes browses Facebook to look for \npictures of underage girls for his sexual gratification, and he sometimes fantasizes about \nabducting and sexually assaulting children at the local shopping center, I do not find his \ncontention that he ran across child pornography inadvertently while browsing adult \npornography to be credible. Under these circumstances, the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 13 apply: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable, as set forth under AG \u00b6 \n14: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;   \n(d) the sexual behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, \nor duress; and  \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the \nbehavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant has undergone therapy since 2017 and treatment with a psychiatrist since \n2020. In addition, in early 2023, he enrolled in SA, a support group for people with addiction \nto pornography. Later that year, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist who concluded \nthat his fantasies about children were related to OCD, not pedophilia, and that the OCD \nwas under control. \nThe psychologist who evaluated Applicant to ascertain his fitness for a security \nclearance based his findings, in part, on Applicant\u2019s characterization that his viewing of \nchild pornography was inadvertent. Given Applicant\u2019s testimony that he knew that some of \nthe girls he viewed were underage, and record evidence that watching underage girls \narouses him, any contention that his viewing of child pornography was inadvertent is not \ncredible. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s admission at the hearing that he knew that some of the girls \nthat he viewed were underage, undercuts the psychologist\u2019s opinion that the pornography \nmodels were more likely than not adults masquerading as children. Most important, \nApplicant admitted that some of the child pornography involved toddlers. Such subjects \ncannot possibly be adult models masquerading as underage children, as the psychologist \nsuggested. Consequently, although the psychologist\u2019s prognosis is favorable, it has limited \nprobative value. Ultimately, AG \u00b6 14(e) is applicable only insofar as Applicant has been \nattending therapy on an ongoing basis. \nAlthough Applicant has not viewed child pornography in approximately seven years, \nhe had intrusive thoughts about a child as recently as 2021. Insufficient time has elapsed to \nconclude that the behavior is unlikely to recur or that it no longer serves as a basis for \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. Neither AG \u00b6 14(c) nor AG \u00b6 14(d) applies. Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the sexual behavior security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) When Applicant completed his security clearance application in 2019, he \ndisclosed that the FBI investigated him, but did not specify the specific nature of the \ninvestigation, Instead, he characterized the investigation as for \u201can unspecified mental \nhealth condition.\u201d Given his otherwise comprehensive response to the question, together \nwith the fact that he voluntarily disclosed this information in the \u201cadditional comments\u201d \nsection of the security clearance application, I conclude that he was sufficiently forthcoming \nso as not to mislead the Office of Personnel Management investigation. I conclude that AG \n\u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s misconduct is particularly egregious, he recognizes this and \nhas been engaging in therapy from medical health professionals. Moreover, approximately \nseven years have elapsed since he last viewed child pornography. Ultimately, the nature \nand seriousness of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, particularly, the violent imagery of some of the \nchild pornography that he viewed is too significant for the presence of rehabilitation or the \npassage of time since the last episode of viewing child pornography, for Applicant to \novercome. I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

In July \n2011, after a warrant was issued for his arrest in state M, he was arrested and charged \nwith failure to return to the scene of an accident, which resulted in him pleading guilty and \nbeing sentenced to 30 days in jail with 29 days suspended and two years of probation. \nHe cited the death of friends and family members at the time for his actions. (Tr. at 43-\n45, 58; GE 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b and cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a. In October 2012, Applicant \nwas arrested in state S and charged with simple possession of marijuana, which was \nfound in his backpack. He returned to state S, where he complied with the terms of the \ncourt, which required him to take a class. After he completed the terms of the court the \nmatter was \u201cdismissed no prosecution\u201d (Tr. at 43, 59; GE 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c and cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. In June 2013, Applicant was arrested \nin state X and charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony \nand assault and battery. He entered the residence of a female classmate who was not \nhome at the time to get his \u201cstuff\u201d from her residence, which he assumed he could do \nwithout issue. However, his ex-girlfriend was in the residence at the time. His ex-girlfriend \naccused him of assault. He denied touching her and testified that she hit him. He left and \nwas arrested later that night. The charges were nolle prossed. (Tr. at 42, 60-61; GE 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d and cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a. In June 2018, he was arrested \nin jurisdiction D and charged with driving under the influence, operating a vehicle while \nimpaired, unlawful possession of ammunition, and reckless driving. The SOR also alleged \nhe had 35 grams of marijuana in his vehicle at the time of his arrest.

He pled guilty to driving under the influence under a \ndeferred sentencing agreement and the charge was dismissed in January 2019 after he \ncompleted a diversion program. (GE 7 at 11; AE E at 3.) He submitted a certificate \nshowing his completion of an alcohol education and treatment course. (AE E at 4.) He \nacknowledged in his testimony that the marijuana was his. He admitted to the arresting \nofficers the ammunition in the vehicle was his and said it was for a properly registered \nweapon. The prosecutor did not go forward on the ammunition charge. (Tr at 62-63; GE \n7 at 3, 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e and cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a. In June 2021, Applicant, a \nresident of jurisdiction D, was arrested in jurisdiction D and charged with felony unlawful \npossession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession of a large \ncapacity ammunition feeding device. As of the date of the SOR, his case was still pending. \nThe police were investigating a gunshot that had entered his neighbor\u2019s residence from \nhis residence. His property manager contacted him and informed him the police were \npresent to search his residence and he testified he consented to their search. (Tr. at 121-\n122.) He denied the police report that stated he was identified coming off the elevator and \nwalking past the officers conducting the search and exiting through the stairwell. He said \nthat he returned later and found his residence \u201ctrashed\u201d and a warrant posted on his door. \n(Tr. 69-70; GE 8 at 3.) The search of his residence revealed the following:   \n- \n4 Mason jars containing marijuana in his living room on his coffee table; \n- \ntotal of 15.9 oz of marijuana found in residence; \n- \n4 vacuum sealed bags containing marijuana in the bedroom; \n- \n180 plastic packaging envelopes in his living room on his coffee table; \n- \n1 digital scale under the living room coffee table; \n- \n1 Glock Model 30 handgun, which was properly registered; \n- \n1 Glock Model 40 handgun, which was properly registered; \n- \n1 shotgun; \n- \n1 semi-automatic rifle with short barrel installed; \n- \n1 upper receiver allowing conversion to a full length rifle; \n- \n1,123 rounds of ammunition of various calibers; \n- \n15 large capacity ammunition feeding devices for the pistols and rifles; \n- \npersonal papers and identification documents of Applicant; and \n- \n$3,024 in U.S. currency in multiple denominations. (GE 8 at 3-4.) \nApplicant told the DoD investigator and testified that he was growing marijuana for \nknowledge and as an experiment. He attributed his interest in the process of growing \nmarijuana to his degree in the natural sciences and thought it would be an interesting \nexperiment and hobby because of the public debate and shifting culture views on \nmarijuana along with the new laws and regulations surrounding marijuana. There was no \nreference in the police report to growing nutrients, flowerpots, or soil. (Tr. at 81, 83, 130; \nGE 8.) He denied selling marijuana.

The amount of marijuana found in his residence, the packaging materials, \nthe scale, and the presence of firearms, as well as the lack of normal growing tools, is not \nconsistent with cultivating marijuana for personal study.

In his SCA he deliberately falsified material \nfacts in three sections of his SCA. SOR \u00b6 3.b, in Section 22 he failed to disclose on of his \nSCA his police record set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In SOR \u00b6 3.c, in Section 22 he failed to \ndisclose on his SCA, his police record set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d.

SOR \u00b6 3.f, when asked whether in the last seven years he had engaged in \nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not he had been caught, charged, or convicted, \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d and did not disclose the information set forth in in SOR \u00b6 1.e until \nconfronted by the DoD investigator. After he was confronted with the SOR \u00b6 1.e incident \nhe discussed it with the investigator. (Tr. at 103-104; GE 2 at 17-18.) He testified his \ncounselor at the time told him not to say anything unless questioned about it because \n\u201cessentially\u201d the charges were going be dropped. (Tr. at 104.) See the above findings of \nfact for the underlying conduct involving his lack of candor and dishonesty involving these \nundisclosed matters. \nApplicant admitted in his testimony that he had used marijuana less than 10 times, \nwhile holding a security clearance and that was why he agreed to sign a letter of non-use. \n(Tr. at 92.) In follow-up questioning about using marijuana while holding a clearance he \ntestified: \u201cI don't remember the last time I smoked \u2026 I [am] going to just say that, going \nforward, I did say that, going forward, it's something I don't do, and it's something that I'm \nwilling to sign my letter of non-use for. Because that's -- I understand the seriousness of \nthe situation and I want to rectify any mistakes I've made in the past.\u201d (Tr. at 110.) The \n2011, 2012, and 2013 arrests were not disclosed in Applicant\u2019s 2017 SCA. (GE 12.) I \nhave limited my consideration of Applicant\u2019s testimony about his marijuana use and his \nnondisclosures on his 2017 SCA to determining his credibility and my whole-person \nanalysis. In addition, I considered his declaration, AE C, the four declarations of support, \nAE D, and his statement of non-use and completion of a substance abuse course, AE E, \nin determining his credibility and my whole-person analysis. \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6 4.a. Applicant is indebted to a financial institution for an account charged \noff in the amount of $18,524. He admits the debt, which was for a credit card. He got it in \nthe 2014-2015 time period. He testified the credit card went into collections when the \nmonthly payments started to get too high for him to pay. He tried to go to a debt \nconsolidation firm to rectify the problem. (Tr. at 116.) He experienced periods of \nunemployment between 2016 and 2018 and had very little income when the account was \ncharged off. (Tr. at 116.) He testified he had reached out to the financial institution and is \nnow making a monthly payment to try to bring the debt down and to try to pay back his \ndebt. (Tr. at 30; 117-118.) In early 2023, he set up a payment plan to pay $238 a month \non the 5th of every month and his first payment was received on February 7, 2023. (AE \nE at 8.) He could not recall when he made his first payment. The later credit reports reflect \nhe has made payments toward the debt. (Answer at 5; Tr. at 107-108; GE 2 at 13; GE 9 \nat 2; GE 10 at 6; GE 11 at 5.) All three credit reports (June 2021, July 2022, August 2023) \nshow the debt as charged off.

(Tr. at 136; \nGE 1 at 25-30.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record, the above\ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is serious. The \nprobation for his most recent criminal conduct was completed less than a year ago. His \ncriminal conduct is part of a pattern from 2011 to June 2021. He had demonstrated some \nrehabilitative potential by completing his assigned classes and complying with sentencing \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterms but these rehabilitative steps have not deterred him from further criminal acts. His \nmost recent rehabilitative steps are insufficient given the record evidence. He has \nprovided insufficient evidence to find that his criminal conduct is unlikely to recur, and his \nconduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted illegal cultivation, possession, and distribution of \nmarijuana after he was granted a security clearance AG \u00b6 25(c) and AG \u00b6 25(f) are \napplicable. The fact marijuana may be legal in Applicant\u2019s jurisdiction makes no \ndifference, See ISCR Case No. 20-01772 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, 2021) (noting \ncontinued relevance of October 25, 2014 DNI Memorandum in the application of \nGuideline H for marijuana cases). AG \u00b6 25(c) applies. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c did not allege drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation as stated in AG \u00b6 25(f). As such, it does not allege the conduct \nidentified in AG \u00b6 25(f). AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nAdditionally, SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges information that is also alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.c, which makes it a duplicate allegation. When the same conduct is alleged twice \nin the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not applicable. Applicant violated state laws on two \noccasions. He then violated Federal drug laws after being granted a security clearance, \nwhich he admits. This behavior raises substantial questions about his judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Based on the items listed in the arrest warrant and his statement \nin the interrogatories, I do not find his claims that he was growing marijuana for scientific \nreasons credible. Given his prior arrest history, the passage of time, a little over 30 months \nsince his last arrest, does not mitigate his conduct. While he provided some evidence of \nactions taken to overcome his problem by not associating with those who use drugs and \nsigning a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement, these actions are \ninsufficient given the record evidence. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the conduct set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1b., 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 2.b, \nand 2.c, conduct which Applicant admitted and included marijuana cultivation and \ndistribution after being granted a security clearance. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 \n3.a. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.d allege Applicant deliberately failed to disclose certain behavior on \nhis SCA. Applicant admitted and the record supports that he deliberately failed to disclose \nor concealed his arrests, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.d.

Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established for either SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.d or SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f. \nApplicant admitted he deliberately failed to disclose the information described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.d, 2.b, and 2.c on his SCA. After submitting his SCA he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions \nfrom a DoD investigator and failed to disclose the information described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.e until confronted by the investigator. There was no evidence of a good-faith effort \nto correct any omission or falsification. \nAG \u00b6 17(b) is not established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f. Applicant was not credible in \nhis testimony and offered no supporting evidence that a counselor had advised him to not \ndisclose any information to the DoD investigator. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for SOR \u00b6 3.a. Applicant\u2019s offenses are not minor. \nThere is a pattern of behavior resulting in him being arrested approximately every four \nyears since 2011, and most recently in June 2021. None of the circumstances are unique \nand his explanation for his 2021 arrest incident is not credible, which occurred while he \nheld a security clearance. \nApplicant has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to \nexploitation by signing his letter of intent to not use marijuana, seeking substance abuse \nassistance and ending his marijuana cultivation. However, he grew and distributed \nmarijuana after being granted a security clearance and his testimony about it being a \nscience experiment was not credible given the items recovered in the residence by the \npolice. Personal conduct security concerns for SOR \u00b6 3.a are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n17(c). \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accrued the debt in question after periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquency is \nongoing and unresolved. He has been employed by his sponsor since February 2021. He \nhas taken seven international trips since the debt in question became delinquent but did \nnot initiate a payment plan until early 2023. It is well-established that the timing of debt \npayments is a relevant consideration for determining whether an applicant has acted in a \nreasonable and responsible manner in addressing financial problems. For example, to \nreceive full credit under Mitigating Condition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \n12 \n (d) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cto a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d His recent \nactions to resolve this debt only after receiving the SOR does not receive full mitigating \ncredit. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Applicant did not \nestablish that he incurred the debt under circumstances unlikely to recur, that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, or that he has made a good-faith effort to pay or \nresolve his debt.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline J, Guideline H, \nGuideline E, and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the criminal conduct, drug involvement, personal conduct, and financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2c: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She works for a government contractor as an eligibility \nspecialist. She was married in 2005 and has three adult children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2000, and a master\u2019s degree in 2016. (Tr. 15-18; GE 1) \nApplicant has delinquent debt going back to at least 2012.

(Tr. 18-28; AE A). \nIn 2018, Applicant was fired from a job she had been working for two years. She \nwas unemployed from about March 2018 through February 2020. Her next period of \nunemployment was from October 2022 through May 2023. She received about $1300 \nmonthly in unemployment benefits. (Tr. 18-29; GE 1) \nApplicant has been with her current employer since June 2023. Her income has \nvaried over her last several jobs. She reported now earning about $2000 net monthly. \nShe and her husband keep their finances separate. He pays most of the house bills and \ntheir mortgage, and they split some utility costs. She pays for her car loan, phone bill, and \ngroceries. She has about $100 left over monthly, which she spends on gasoline. Her \nhusband is retired, and she does not know his monthly income. She has no retirement \naccount or savings. She does not maintain a monthly budget, because she does not have \nenough money leftover at the end of the month for discretionary spending or debt \npayments. The credit repair agency has given her financial advice, but she has not taken \nany kind of financial literacy training. (Tr. 28-56) \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling about $195,000, and it alleges that \nshe was terminated from her job in 2018 for submitting a fraudulent expense report. The \nstatus of the allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e, are student loan accounts placed for collection for \n$67,548. Applicant denied these allegations and claimed in her answer that her loans \nassociated with \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b had been consolidated or removed from her credit report, \nhowever, student loans appear on all her credit reports. She claimed her student loans \nwent into collection in 2019, but she has never paid them since finishing her master\u2019s \ndegree in 2016. She was unable to provide any information about when they were \nconsolidated or with what lender. She does not know the status of the loan associated \nwith \u00b6 1.e.

Applicant denied this allegation and stated \nthat she was fired unjustly. She worked for this company for about two years as a traveling \nadministrator and went to nine different facilities in her state. When she got a new boss, \nshe was told to work from a fixed location. She had previously been reimbursed for travel \nexpenses.

(Tr. 28-\n65; AE A, C; GE 7)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit reports \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions in her testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies only to SOR \u00b6 1.k, but not to any of the debts alleged. Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient evidence showing that any of the alleged debts are being paid, \nare resolved, or became delinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nHer failure to pay these debts is both long-term and recent, as well as ongoing and \nunresolved. This continues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.

The amount owed is unknown. She did not provide \ndocumentation of a payment plan or resolution with the IRS.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. She did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising out of her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

We are still \ncurrently going through a 5-year divorce. I have not made a payment or a \nrepayment arrangement because I am fighting to have my ex take on the \ndebt above. I am financially stable, and I do not live outside my means. If I \nam unable to prove he caused this debt, and it is now my obligation to \nrepay I will start to pay off all the above debt. It is not my intention to never \nrepay.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the Applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \nApplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to the conduct of her abusive and \ncontrolling ex-husband. He handled the family\u2019s finances, and without her knowledge, \nhe opened accounts in her name and ran the balances up on accounts. He convinced \nher while they were separated to buy a car for him in her name because he had bad \ncredit. They were separated, living in different states, and he had bad credit, which \nshould have put her on notice that it was a bad idea. He had a lawyer for their divorce; \nshe did not; and the debts were apparently not attributed to him. He did not pay any \nchild support before the divorce and had only made one $375 payment as of the date of \nthe hearing. Her ex-husband\u2019s actions regarding the loans and credit cards were \nbeyond her control; the deficiency balance on the repossessed vehicle was within her \ncontrol, as she should never have purchased the vehicle in the first place. \nThis is a unique case because Applicant did not have a track record of debt \nrepayment when the record closed in February 2023. She testified that she planned to \npay or settle the debts, and she apparently had the financial means to start doing so. \nHer salary was about $67,000 a year; she received about $1,800 a month in VA \ndisability payments; she shared living expenses with her partner; and child support was \nordered by the court. Since she chose not to supplement the record, there is no \nevidence that she made any arrangements with her creditors. \nI accept Applicant\u2019s testimony that her ex-husband was the cause of most of her \nfinancial problems. However, she has been promising since at least 2022 that she will \nstart resolving her debts, but there is no evidence that she has done anything about \nthem. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d I am obligated to follow that \ndirective. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are insufficient to overcome financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

His history of financial \nproblems is not mitigated by the favorable financial information or whole-person \nevidence in the record. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 2, 2022, the DOD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline.

I admitted Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, without objection. \nAfter the hearing, I left the record open until September 1, 2023, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documentation. He made his first submission on September 5, 2023; \nhowever, given the volume of the submission, I asked that he resubmit it through \nDODSAFE. He uploaded two files on October 9, 2023.

I granted the motion. The amendment is added to \nthe SOR as \u00b6 1.k. Applicant denied the allegation. (Tr. 75-77, 103-117) \nIn response to Applicant\u2019s post hearing submissions, Department Counsel \nmoved to amend the SOR to add two allegations: 1.l that Applicant owes $91,077 in \nFederal taxes for the 2017 through 2022; and 1.k that Applicant owes $29,379 in state \nincome taxes for the tax years 2017 through 2022. The motion is denied. The SOR \nclearly alleges a history of financial problems that raises security concern. While the \nallegations are reflective of the information in Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions, \nadditional allegations are cumulative. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 46, has worked for his employer as the chief operating officer of a \nstartup company seeking to obtain federal contracts. He has been in this position since \nSeptember 2020. He was initially granted access to classified information in 2004 during \nhis service in the U.S. Navy.

The \nbackground investigation discovered additional delinquent accounts. The SOR alleges \nthat Applicant owes $119,423 on ten delinquent accounts. (Tr. 25-27; GE 1-5) \nApplicant began experiencing financial problems during his naval service. He \nserved on active duty from January 1997 to February 2014, and in the Navy Reserve \nfrom February 2014 to February 2017, when he retired. He initially consulted a \nbankruptcy lawyer sometime between 2012 and 2013, to address his debt as he \ntransitioned to civilian life but was advised that his income was too high to qualify for \nbankruptcy protection.

(Tr. 56,60, 63, 77-79; GE 1) \nSince transitioning to civilian employment, Applicant has sought employment with \nhigher pay to meet his personal expenses. He worked his first civilian job from \nDecember 2013 to October 2015. He sought other employment when he realized that \nthere was no room for advancement. He continued to seek higher paying jobs, \ntransitioning from engineering into sales roles. He worked for two different companies \nbetween 2015 and 2017, with the hopes of earning sales commissions, in addition to his \nbase salary. Neither sales position worked out as he planned. He accepted his current \nposition with the understanding that if the company was successful, the job would be \nlucrative. And that if the company was not, he would not receive the agreed upon \ncompensation. He accepted the position expecting to earn a $144,000 base salary, as \nwell as one percent of the company\u2019s annual revenue and up to six percent equity in the \ncompany, which he believed would be between an additional $20,000 and $30,000 \nannually. (Tr. 30, 45-48, 52-53, 57, 61, 80-84; GE 7) \nBecause he continued to struggle financially, Applicant decided to implement the \nsimulated bankruptcy strategy in 2015. He admits that he stopped paying his debts \nbetween 2015 and 2016, including three student loans. He instead chose to focus on \nhis child support obligations for three of his five children. He does not have any financial \nobligation for two of the five children. As of the hearing, Applicant had not made any \npayments on the accounts alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 43-44, 63-67; GE 2-5) In his post-\nhearing submission, Applicant explained with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.j: \nPurposefully \"unresolved\" per my \"simulated bankruptcy plan,\u201d which I \nmentioned in my initial response to the SOR, as well as, within the \nhearing. Similar to pages 17-18, after a period of time, \u201cthe statute of \nlimitations period\u201d is met. At this point, it is too old to collect upon and the \ncreditor writes it off as a loss. The debt is no longer owed to anyone. \nSimilar to declaring bankruptcy, the creditor writes it off. \"Settled\" follows \nin time, per plan. It falls off of the credit report and one\u2019s credit begins to \nimprove, from that moment forward. A \u201cfresh start\u201d is given, per law. This \nfresh start is what I needed, and only now am I beginning to realize. (AE I \npp 1-4, 11-14,19-21; AE K) \nHe claims not to recognize the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He believes that the \ndebt alleged in \u00b6 1.i is associated with a home he previously owned and is no longer \ncollectible under the statute of limitations. He explained that the creditor advised him to \naddress the debt with the credit reporting agencies. He challenged the debt with one of \nthe credit bureaus and the debt does not appear on the October 2023 credit report he \nsubmitted. (AE I, pp.15-18; AE K) \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant owes $43,705 on three delinquent student \nloans. He admits that he stopped paying the loans in 2015 or 2016.

Enrollment in the program opened on December 1, \n2022. He enrolled each loan in the program on October 5, 2023, selecting an income-\ndriven income plan. (https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/default-fresh-start; \nTr. 67-70, 84; GE 2-5; AE I, pp. 5-10) \nIn response to questions about the status of his federal and state income tax \nfilings, he admitted that he had not filed either between 2019 and 2022. He is a 1099 \nemployee. His employer does not withhold federal or state income tax from his pay. He \nalso admitted that he likely owed additional federal and state income tax liabilities. In his \npost-hearing submission, he prepared a tax summary showing his federal and state \nincome status between 2017 and 2022 tax years. Applicant described the federal \nincome tax return status for the 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022 tax years as \n\u201ccomplete/filing.\u201d He owes over $92,000 in taxes for those years. He paid $3,600 toward \nthe balance on August 31, 2023. The records he provided show that he has not made \nregular payments toward his outstanding federal income tax debt. He describes the \nstatus of his state income tax returns as \u201cdrafting/filing\u201d for the 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, \nand 2022 tax years. He owes approximately $29,000 in additional state income tax \nliability. He plans to pay $1,690 toward outstanding tax liabilities each month for the \nnext 72 months. He listed the 2019 federal and state income tax returns as \u201cfiled/paid\u201d \nwith no tax liability owed. He has not retained a tax professional. (Tr. 72-74, 85-88, 103-\n117; AE I, pp.90-94; AE M-W) \nAlthough he does not use a formal budget to monitor his expenses, he believes \nthat his finances are under control. According to a October 2023 credit report, his credit \nscore is 700. The report shows that he has no derogatory accounts reported, citing the \nstatute of limitations. (Tr. 49-50; AE I, pp. 21-52) \nHe believes that his finances will improve dramatically once his company secures \na large federal contract on which it is bidding. At the time of the hearing, the company \nwas not yet generating sufficient revenue to pay its expenses. Since its inception, the \ncompany has relied on its primary investor for capital to pay the operating expenses. \nHowever, in 2023, the investor began scaling back on its capital injections into the \ncompany. As a result, Applicant explained that the company began \u201cbootstrapping\u201d its \navailable cash to pay expenses. At the time of the hearing, he believed the company \nwas going to reduce his pay by an unknown amount to divert available funds to \naccounts payable. He believes that if the company wins the contract it should begin to \nrealize revenue during the 2024 fiscal year. As of the hearing, Applicant has \napproximately $11,000 in cash and no other assets. (Tr. 35-39, 89-90) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$119,427 in delinquent debt, including $43,705 in unpaid student loans that became \ndelinquent for at least five years before the student loan payment pause between 2020 \nand 2023. He also admitted failing to file his federal and state income tax returns \nbetween 2109 and 2021. The following financial considerations disqualifying conditions \napply: \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness or inability to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or frequently filing annual Federal, state, local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nNone of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply. Applicant \nintentionally defaulted on his debts instead of repaying his creditors. He does not have \nan intent to pay them or the ability to do so. Of particular concern is Applicant\u2019s failure \nto honor his obligations to the federal government, intentionally defaulting on his student \nloans and failing to properly handle his income tax obligations. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Furthermore, applicants are not held to a \nstandard of perfection. All that is required is that he develop a plan for handling his \ndelinquent accounts and executing a plan to do so. He has not provided a legitimate \nplan for resolving his delinquent debts. Applicant is financially unstable. He is working \nfor a company that is financially unstable. His plans for financial rehabilitation are rooted \nin his hope that the company will become profitable soon. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information.

See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2014. The SOR \nalleges eight delinquent accounts totaling $27,181. Applicant resolved a delinquent credit \ncard account totaling $1,017 in June 2023, (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and past due child support totaling \nabout $2,873 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). In June 2023, he made a $500 payment on a $1,580 debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). He has not provided documentary evidence that he has resolved or is \nresolving the remaining debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are longstanding and \nongoing. Although he has had financial problems since at least 2014, he took limited or \nno action to resolve seven of eight debts alleged in the SOR until after he received it. He \npurchased an expensive truck about a year after telling a background investigator that he \nintended to address his financial obligations and then about two-years later he purchased \nan expensive motorcycle. He has not shown that his financial problems are unlikely to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecur, and his financial behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s divorce and associated debt, and \nunderemployment were largely beyond his control. However, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant received financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, but he has not provided sufficient evidence that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the delinquent child support debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h. It is not fully established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g. The timing of an \nApplicant\u2019s actions, including repayment of delinquent debts, impacts upon the degree to \nwhich the mitigating factors apply. ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2009). Waiting to pay legitimate debts until forced to do so by the security clearance \nprocess does not constitute good-faith debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 10-05909 at \n3 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012).  \nAlthough Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the creditor alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b after the hearing, he has not provided sufficient evidence to identify which \ndebt the agreement applied to or of payment under the agreement on either debt. He has \nmade no payments on the student loans since 2014, and first contacted the creditor about \nloan consolidation a week before the hearing, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d. With respect to the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f, he did not communicate with the creditors from 2017 until May \n2023, and made payments on both debts only after the hearing. Although I resolved the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f in his favor because he paid it, his payment was after the hearing \nand does not warrant full mitigative credit. And he paid only about one-third of the \ndelinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He said he paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g in \nDecember 2022, but did not provide documentary evidence of payment. That this debt \nhas dropped off a recent credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. See \nISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant did not assert a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of any delinquent debt alleged in the SOR or provide documented \nproof of his actions to resolve any disputes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s work and military history, security clearance history, and that his financial \nproblems were caused, in part, by circumstances beyond his control. I also considered \nhis improved financial circumstances, and that he has paid some of his delinquent debts. \nHowever, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a longer track record of financial responsibility, he may be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e, 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 18, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to me on November 7, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non November 17, 2023, scheduling the matter for a video conference hearing on \nDecember 19, 2023.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January \n4, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 98) Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6 1.c and 2.c, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, and 2.b. He is 29 years old, \nmarried, and he has two sons, ages eight and four. He has owned his home since May \n2020. (Tr. 6-7, 28-29, 37-38, 76, 89, 95; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2013. He has attended college since 2022 \nand anticipates receiving an associate degree in the summer of 2024. He has served in \nthe U.S. Army Reserve since 2013, and he was promoted to sergeant in 2020. He worked \nat a food processing company from approximately 2018 to 2019. He then worked for a \ndefense contractor until November 2021. Since then, he has worked for another defense \ncontractor. He was granted a security clearance in approximately 2013. (Tr. 5, 7-10, 29-\n39, 53, 67, 82-83; GE 1; AE A) \nApplicant was drug tested when he first joined the Reserve in 2013. He has since \nbeen subject to random drug testing through the Reserve. He tested positive for \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on a drug test administered by his Reserve unit in February \n2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), as further discussed below. He testified that he was also randomly \ndrug tested in December 2018, March 2019, and June 2019. He understands that illegal \ndrug use is not permitted while holding a security clearance. At the time of his positive \ndrug test, he was a private first-class mechanic, and he also worked at the food \nprocessing company. He held a clearance, but he did not have access to classified \ninformation, as his duties did not require it. He began working with sensitive information \nwhen he was promoted to sergeant in 2020, and when he began working for his current \nemployer in 2021. (Tr. 38-41, 56-57, 82-85, 91-94; GE 4) \nApplicant denied knowingly using THC monthly in 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a) He \nmistakenly listed this information when he completed his response to interrogatories in \nDecember 2023. He meant to report that he unknowingly used THC, for only one month \nin 2019, when he purchased and used a \u201cvape pen\u201d that he did not know contained THC. \nHe started vaping when he worked at the food processing company in December 2018. \nIt was a hectic environment and vaping relieved his stress. From December 2018 to \nMarch 2019, he purchased and used between six to seven vapes from a smoke shop. \nThe vapes were about the size of a key fob and lasted him about three weeks. After \npurchasing it, he would charge the vape and use it on his lunch breaks. He lost some of \nthe vapes and a few stopped working after losing their charge.

It was different than the previous vapes \nhe had purchased because it was more expensive, it looked like a pen, and it had a \ncartridge, a push button, and liquid in it. The store clerk told him that it was a new vape, \nit held its charge longer than the vapes that looked like key fobs, and it was better for him. \nHe decided to try it because it was more convenient. He did not feel anything different \nfrom using this vape pen than he felt from the previous vapes. He was administered a \ndrug test by his Reserve unit on February 10, 2019. He continued to use the vape pen \ninto March 2019. In March 2019, he purchased and used one more of the less expensive \nvape, and then he stopped vaping because he realized it was affecting his lung capacity \nwhen he went to the gym. (Tr. 16-17, 39, 41-52, 55-57, 81-87, 93-94; GE 1, 2, 4) \nIn May 2019, Applicant was informed by his commander that he tested positive for \nTHC. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He was shocked and confused. He eventually determined that his \npositive drug test resulted from the new vape pen he purchased and used because, in \nthe timeframe of the February 6, 2019 drug test, it was the only thing different during the \nperiod he was vaping. He maintained that he did not know the vape pen contained THC \nand he unknowingly used THC through the vape pen. This is the only time he has ever \ntested positive for THC or any other illegal drugs. He never used THC either before, or \nsince, he inadvertently smoked from the vape pen without realizing it contained THC. He \nhas no intentions of using THC or any other illegal drugs in the future, and he does not \nsocialize with individuals who use THC or any other illegal drugs. (Tr. 16-17, 39, 41-52, \n55-57, 81-87, 93-94; GE 1, 2, 4) \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s positive drug test, his commander informed him that the \nprocess of medically discharging him from the Reserve had commenced. He testified that \na judge advocate appeared on his behalf \u201cagainst the charges of smoking [THC].\u201d He was \ntold that he could remain in the Reserve if he maintained good behavior. In 2020, he was \npromoted to sergeant and put in charge of other soldiers. He described the experience of \n\u201calmost getting kicked out\u201d of the Reserve as \u201cthe worst feeling in my life, because at this \npoint, the Army is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d He stated that he learned his lesson, \nunderstands that, as a security clearance holder, he is responsible for knowing and \nunderstanding anything that he ingests. In that regard, he intends to exercise diligence in \nthe future. (Tr. 49, 52-55, 87-89, 95; AE A) \nIn around April 2013, at age 18 and prior to leaving for Reserve boot camp, \nApplicant worked at Walmart. He unlawfully took a gaming system from his workplace for \nwhich he had not paid. In December 2013, he was charged with misdemeanor \nembezzlement, less than $200. In January 2014, at age 19, he pled guilty and he was \nsentenced to twelve months in jail, suspended, placed on two years of unsupervised \nprobation, and ordered to pay restitution. He stated that his misguided actions cost him \napproximately $10,000, including $1,200 for restitution and his lawyer\u2019s fees. He has not \nbeen convicted for any other criminal offense. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) (Tr. 16-17, 58-61, 90-91; GE \n1, 3; AE A) \nApplicant moved multiple times before he bought his home in May 2020.

(Tr. 17, 32-38; \nGE 1-2) \nIn October 2016, an order to show cause was issued and Applicant was \nsummoned to appear in court for failure to obey an order regarding visitation for one of \nhis children. He believed he appeared in court. The order was dismissed in November \n2016. (Tr. 61-63; GE 1) \nIn 2020, the mother of Applicant\u2019s eldest son petitioned the court for a protective \norder (PO) against Applicant and his mother. His eldest son, who was around four years \nold at the time, had fallen, injured his face, and required medical care. The child\u2019s mother \nattempted to reach Applicant through his mother. When Applicant arrived at the hospital, \nhe saw that his mother and his eldest son\u2019s mother were \u201cgoing back and forth,\u201d and he \ntried to separate them. The police interjected. Applicant and his mother declined to press \ncharges but his eldest son\u2019s mother pursued the PO. When Applicant and his mother \nappeared in court, the judge dismissed the petition. (Tr. 63-65; GE 1) \nIn November 2020, an arrest warrant was issued for Applicant to show cause why \nhe failed to appear at his civil case involving the petition for child support that his \nyoungest son\u2019s mother had filed against him. The order was subsequently dismissed \nbecause Applicant had not received notice of the initial hearing, as he was served at a \nbad address. Applicant did not learn about the foregoing arrest warrant until he attempted \nto get his DoD common access card for his current job in December 2020, at which time, \nhe was arrested, notified of an outstanding warrant, and jailed. This was the only time he \nhas been arrested. When he contacted this youngest son\u2019s mother following his arrest, \nshe informed him about the child support petition for the first time. After the arrest warrant \nwas dismissed, he was summoned to appear for a new hearing on the child support \npetition. In January 2022, Appellant was ordered to show cause why he failed to appear \nfor DNA testing. The show cause was subsequently dismissed because the notice to \nappear for DNA testing had been sent to a wrong address. Once he was properly notified, \nhe completed the DNA testing. He remains current with his child support obligations for \nboth children, with whom he also has visitation rights. (Tr. 65-70, 72-74, 78-81; GE 1-2) \nIn around 2021, an arrest warrant was issued for Applicant to show cause why he \nfailed to appear at a court hearing regarding a child neglect charge. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) The \nmother of one of his sons accused him of child neglect after he brought the child to her \nhome with a wet diaper. He believed she did so because she saw his girlfriend in the car \nwith him. He did not appear in court because he never received a summons, as it was \nsent to a bad address. He denied that he was arrested in connection with this issue. \nAnother summons to appear was issued to his correct address, for a new court hearing \nin November 2021 for his child neglect charge, at which time the arrest warrant and the \nchild neglect charge were dismissed.

This was the last time Applicant has been involved in an event involving \nhis failure to appear or failure to obey. (Tr. 73-78, 83; GE 2) \nThe 2016 order to show cause, 2020 protective order, 2020 civil support case and \nrelated proceedings, and 2022 summons were not alleged in the SOR. Thus, they may \nnot serve an independent basis for revoking Applicant\u2019s clearance. However, they may \nbe considered to evaluate Applicant\u2019s credibility; to evaluate his evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for the whole-person \nanalysis. I have considered these unalleged events for these limited purposes. \nApplicant provided a December 2023 letter of support from a senior mechanic non\u00ad\ncommissioned officer who has known him since May 2021. This individual vouched for \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant was awarded an Army \nAchievement Medal in September 2017 for exceptional service and an Army Reserve \nComponent Achievement Medal in June 2019. He received a favorable evaluation report \nfor the period October 2022 to September 2023, when he served as a squad leader. (AE \nA) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAlthough Applicant tested positive for THC on a drug test administered by his \nReserve unit in February 2019, he did so because he unknowingly used THC for a month \nin 2019, when he purchased and used a vape pen that he did not know contained THC. \nHe was candid and credible at the hearing about the circumstances surrounding his use \nof a vape pen that he did not know contained THC. His unknowing use of THC does not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nraise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith laws and regulations and does not establish disqualifying conditions under Guideline \nH. See ISCR Case No. 22-01176 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2023), in which the Appeal Board \nheld that the innocent use of an illegal drug does not raise security concerns under \nGuideline H and that if an applicant successfully refutes the pertinent SOR allegations, \nthose allegations should be resolved in favor of the applicant and the Judge does not \nneed to conduct a mitigation analysis regarding them. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant was convicted in 2014 of misdemeanor embezzlement. While he did not \nuse marijuana monthly in 2019, he used marijuana for about a month in 2019. In 2021, \nhe was charged with child neglect and a warrant was issued for his arrest for failure to \nappear in court. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs I previously stated under my Guideline H analysis, Applicant unknowingly used \nTHC for about a month in 2019. AG \u00b6 32(c) is established for SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s \nmisdemeanor embezzlement conviction in 2014 occurred when he was 19 years old. This \nwas the only time he was convicted of a criminal offense. The 2021 child neglect charge \nand related warrant were dismissed. The unalleged conduct between 2016 and 2022 was \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndismissed because he was served at a bad address.

He was candid and credible at the hearing. \nI find that enough time has elapsed since his criminal behavior and without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, and the record evidence does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \nand 2.c \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J in my \nwhole-person analysis. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during his \nhearing and found that he was credible, candid, and remorseful. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the criminal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(GE 4 and 5; AE \nV; Tr. 74-79.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 57 years old, married since 1992, has three adult sons, and one \ngrandson. He graduated from a service academy in 1989 with a degree in computer \nscience. He served on active duty in the U.S. military for 12 years and left active duty in \n2001 with an honorable discharge. He worked for the predecessor of his current employer \nand his current employer for 22 years after leaving the U.S. military. Those companies \nwere, and are, defense contractors. He is the principal engineer and subject matter expert \non a defense system and has traveled extensively in the United States and overseas to \nsupport that system. He has had security clearances continuously since he was 18 years \nold. (Tr. 17-20; GE 1.) His spouse has a Master\u2019s Degree in Business Administration \n(MBA) and took accounting classes throughout that course of studies. She also was a \nmanager of large projects that included budgets and accounting. (Tr. 142-144.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has four delinquent credit card debts totaling \n$58,541 and four delinquent federal income tax debts for tax years 2018 through 2021 \ntotaling $55,222. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d and 1.e -1.h.) Applicant denied the first and last credit \ncard debts and admitted the middle two such debts, stating that all four will be paid in full \nby automatic payroll deductions. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d.) He admitted the first three tax \nallegations, denied the last one, and explained that he was in the process of entering a \nnew installment agreement with the IRS. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.e -1.h.) In the seven years before \nhe completed the February 2021 SCA, he never had any failures to file returns or pay \nfederal income taxes. (GE 1.) \nConsumer Debts \nApplicant has three sons, ages 35, 31, and 27. (GE 1.) The two younger sons live \nwith him and his wife. He supports them. The youngest son does not work, and the middle \nson has a part-time job. One of them is a student. (Tr. unclear.) His oldest son, his wife, \nand their then new grandson lived with Applicant from 2016 to 2019. (Tr. 22-24.) To \nprepare for that period, Applicant began renovating his basement to convert it into an \napartment. That project began in or before 2016 and continued through 2018.

Applicant and his family had lived in that home since 2002. As a result, the \nrenovation costs were higher than he anticipated. He used the four SOR credit cards to \nhelp purchase the materials to complete the renovations. His son and his family moved \nout in 2019 and now have their own home. Those four credit cards went into collections \nin 2015, 2016, and 2020. Applicant\u2019s federal income tax troubles started in about 2019. \n(AE AA; Tr. 20-22, 44-45; GE 4 and 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a This is a credit card account placed for collection in August 2020 for \n$19,953. (GE 4 and 5.) Applicant did not recall \u201cthe exact things\u201d he used it for. His \nfinancial issues (taxes and credit card debt) built up in about the middle or end of 2019. \nHe then prioritized his debts, secured debt like the house and vehicles, and then taxes \nand credit card debt. This was one of the credit cards he used for his renovations. He was \npaying credit card accounts through garnishments of his pay. At one point, 25 percent of \nhis take-home pay was being garnished, $2,500 to $3,000 per month.  (Tr. 24- 36, 197-\n198; AE AA.)  \nAs of Applicant\u2019s March 29, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI), he was paying \nthis account monthly through garnishment. (GE 2 at 11.) At hearing, he testified that this \naccount has been paid in full, referring to AE E and AE F. AE E shows that the original \nSOR creditor sold the debt to Bank A on August 20, 2020, and AE F shows that Bank A \nnotified Applicant on January 13, 2023, that the judgment had been satisfied. (Tr. 37-38.) \nThis debt has been resolved. \nApplicant testified about his use of garnishments: \nAJ: I think you testified that it was an involuntary garnishment. \nApp.: It was a garnishment as done by court order. So I guess, yes, \nsir, I guess you can call that an involuntary garnishment. It was the way we \nhad decided to pay it off. The most direct way to pay off these debts was to \nmake sure it came out of our pay. \nAnd if we, since we had not been able to enter into an agreement to \npay it off, and we got to the point where the court case had brought - - was \nbrought forward, the garnishment did make it an involuntary payment, yes. \nAJ: So you attempted with [Bank A] to negotiate a payment. \nApp.: I don\u2019t know, looking back or trying to remember at this time, if \nwe had attempted to negotiate a payment or just decided that the \ngarnishment was the best way to pay it off. \nAJ: So you didn\u2019t oppose the garnishment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApp.: Did not, did not oppose.

We did not oppose any one \nof them. (Tr. 38-39.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. This is a credit card account placed for collection in March 2015 for \n$15,754. (GE 4 and 5.) Applicant used this credit card for remodeling the basement, so \nhis oldest son and family could live there. He testified that on August 5, 2020, the creditor \noffered to settle the full amount of $15,754 for $5,513, being referred to AE K. He testified \nthat the account has been paid in full, citing AE L, M, and N. AE L shows a beginning \nprincipal of $15,754 on December 4, 2020, with biweekly payroll deductions of $1,299 \nthrough June 2023, and a final payment of $340 received on February 2, 2024. (AE M \nand N.) Final payment was confirmed by EX 1A. (Tr. 44 \u2013 55.) This debt has been \nresolved. \nApplicant testified about his response to the creditor\u2019s offer to settle for less \nthan full value: \nApp.: We did not - - I did not want to have any of these unpaid. So \nrather than accept the offer for $5500 to pay it off, we told them we wanted \nto pay off the entire amount. \nD.C.: Okay, did you have a payment plan with them to pay off the \nentire amount? \nApp.: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know if there was a payment plan, or \nwe just decided that the - - that paying it off through a garnishment was \nagain the best way to ensure that we paid it.

This debt has been resolved. \nFederal Income Taxes \nIn AE AA, Applicant explained the genesis and progression of his federal income \ntax problems, which began after filing their 2018 taxes in 2019. He and his family had \nlived in the same home since 2002, had the same or higher salaries, took the same \nexemptions, dependents (home owned, children, etc.), and similar withholdings. But his \nfederal tax bill went from $11,422, for 2017 to $31,681, for 2018. Even though he followed \nthe IRS instructions for the amount of withholdings, the amount was not sufficient to cover \nthe 2018 tax obligations. This was unexpected and contrary to 16 years of historical data. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn AE AA, Applicant stated that historically he had received a federal refund of \n$5,000 to $10,000 per year. Suddenly, he owed an additional $15,549, above what had \nbeen withheld during 2018. He had just completed finishing his basement into an \napartment for his oldest son and then newborn child at higher costs than expected. The \nanticipated refund was planned to help pay down this added debt. \nApplicant thought this may have been a one-time issue, but research showed that \n2018 federal tax law changed how state and local taxes impacted federal tax and \neliminated deductions he had previously taken, such as student loan interest and college \ntuition for his wife and son. He hoped these changes would change with the next \nadministration, but that did not occur. They would remain in place from 2018 to 2025. He \ndecreased his exemptions to withhold more from his pay and entered into an installment \nagreement to pay $300 per month for 2018 taxes. The lack of a 2018 refund, increased \nwithholdings, and the added $300 per month to IRS impacted his budget. They increased \nincome and decreased expenses to stay on top of their budget through 2019. (AE AA.) \nApplicant\u2019s federal income taxes remained an issue. When he filed 2019 taxes in \n2020, he found that even with decreased exemptions he still owed a large amount, due \nto his overtime and his wife\u2019s increased income. The IRS included the added 2019 amount \nin his $300 per month installment plan. He then decreased his exemptions again for 2020 \nand 2021, and at the end of 2021 taxes had been paid in full (but not 2018 yet). He \neliminated exemptions completely which increased 2022 withholdings, and he overpaid \nby $1,181 for 2022 (which was immediately applied to 2018 taxes still owed.). (AE AA.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant was asked the following questions: \nD.C.: So your 2018, \u201919, \u201920, \u201921 taxes, when you realized in 2019 \nthat the Tax Code had changed, then 2019 came along and you filed, is \nthere a reason why you didn\u2019t take sufficient deductions out? \nApp.: The answer to that is tied to the Tax Code changes. We \nactually continued to maintain the exemptions as they were recommended \nby the IRS. So we did not change our exemptions between - - so if you look \nat the total taxes owed between 2017 and 2018, we did not change our \nexemptions between 2017 and 2018, but our withholdings dropped by \n$6,000 even though our income went up . . . So we did not change our \nexemptions between 2018, but our withholdings actually went down by \n$6,000 even though our income went up by $56,000. \nD.C.: At any time did you ever think to seek a tax professional? \nApp.: We didn\u2019t. \nD.C.: [Y]ou suffered . . . some penalties in 2019, in 2020, is there a \nreason why you did not take additional deductions to ensure . . . ? \nApp.: In 2020, I believe we did decrease our exemptions so that our \nwithholdings went up in 2020 and \u201921. We moved them up slowly thinking \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat we would get back to where we supposed to be so that our withholdings \nwould match our total tax liability, and obviously we didn\u2019t do enough. \nBecause it took - - again we were following the IRS guidelines for the \nnumber of exemptions . . . and each year it showed that the guideline did \nnot work for us living in [state A].  \nIn 2022 when we finally did get a refund, we had completely \neliminated our exemptions. So the only way we finally got to a refund in \n2022 was to completely ignore the IRS guidelines and have no exemptions \nat all, which is the same way we were for 2023. \nD.C.: [D]id you think about . . . having more taxes taken out of your \nincome so as to avoid owing the IRS at the end? \nApp.\u2019s spouse answered: [W]e did change our deductions, our \nexemptions, which should have increased our withholding . . I changed my \nW-4 at work to single, no exemptions . . . We changed [Applicant\u2019s] as well. \nBut we also started earning more income also. And I switched jobs , \ntoo. And we were adjusting our exemptions and withholdings. But our \nincome was increasing as well, which was also impacting our tax \ndeductions. And so it was just - - we were chasing the tax filing six months \nafter the fact because, . . . we didn\u2019t realize the implications of our 2018 \nwithholdings until April of 2019. So then we adjusted what we could while . \n. . not trying to get ourselves in even more debt . . . but we adjusted as we \ncould. \nBut we didn\u2019t realize the implications of the adjustments until the next \nyear. It wasn\u2019t immediately known - - because we adjusted. And it took a \ncouple years to get to the balance point where we now are paying - - our \nwithholdings are much higher than our tax obligation to where we got . . . \nour tax refund in 2022 and a refund for 2023 tax years. \nSo we did adjust, but it wasn\u2019t enough. And we didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t \nenough until the next tax year. (Tr. 193-197.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. This is a debt for delinquent federal income taxes of $10,597 for tax \nyear 2018. This was the first tax year that reflected the significant changes to federal \nincome tax laws. Applicant testified about GE 2B at 4-5, his IRS tax transcript for tax year \n2018. For tax year 2018, he and his wife filed separately, although in the past they had \nfiled jointly. They did that because it was more financially advantageous and legal. There \nwas no refund.

(Tr. 106-108; GE 2B.) Thereafter, the tax \nhistory becomes somewhat complicated. \nThe 2019 Plan ended on October 18, 2021, for two reasons, apparently unknown \nto Applicant or his spouse. First, Applicant and his spouse had filed 2018 and 2019 tax \nreturns separately, but they filed the 2021 tax return jointly. The IRS did not allow a \ncombined joint/separate amount owed in an installment plan. To remedy that \nincompatibility, he paid $8,000 ($7K + $1K) on September 22, 2022 and had it applied to \nhis 2021 taxes. Those payments were not made under any plan, but those payments \nremoved the first impediment to a plan. (AE B; Tr. 124-131.) \nThe second reason IRS ended the 2019 Plan was that when Applicant filed his \n2020 tax returns his cumulative amount owed put him over an IRS threshold that would \nnot allow the 2019 Pan to continue. To remedy this threshold problem, he paid $8,000 \n($7K + $1K) on September 22, 2022 and had it applied to his 2021 taxes. Those payments \nwere not made under any plan, but those payments removed the other impediment to a \nplan. (AE B; Tr. 111, 133-134.) He filed returns for tax years 2019 to 2022. (AE AA.) In \nbetween July 15, 2021, and September 22, 2022, his credit card garnishment payments \ncontinued. (Tr. 124-125, 131.) \nHaving removed the two impediments to an installment plan, on July 14, 2023, \nApplicant signed a new IRS Plan (2023 Plan) for $1,000 per month beginning on \nSeptember 15, 2023, with the total amount owed being $47,201. The 2023 Plan covers \ntax years 2018 through 2021. (AE A.) They are current under the 2023 Plan. (Tr. 147-\n152; AE A; EX 1C.) EX 1T is an IRS Payment Activity document that shows his $1,000 \npayments under the 2023 Plan from September 22, 2022, to March 15, 2024, with the \nFebruary 15, 2024 payment applied to the 2018 tax year. The March 15, 2024 payment \nis applied to tax year 2019. Applicant has resolved his 2018 tax delinquency.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. This is a debt for delinquent federal income taxes of $17,122 for the tax \nyear 2019. Applicant is referred to his Answer, page 2, and agrees that he is on a Plan \nfor tax year 2019. He asked his spouse to testify on this subject. She testified that she \ndoes the tax returns. When they filed their 2019 tax returns, they asked the IRS for a Plan \nfor 2019 taxes, but the IRS declined because at the time they were already on the April \n2019 Plan. The 2019 taxes are now covered by the 2023 Plan. Their $1,000 monthly \npayments are current under that Plan, as they are automatically deducted from their bank \naccounts monthly. Once the 2018 arrearage is paid, the IRS will apply the monthly \npayments to the 2019 arrearage, and so on through the 2021 arrearage. They are current \nunder the 2023 Plan.

The first was a vacation from \nJuly 30 to August 12, 2019. He was accompanied by his spouse and one son to countries \nin Europe. (Tr. 166.) There was also a trip to the Middle East in April 2022. On that trip, \nhe was on business in one country for two weeks. He and his spouse then went on a \nvacation to a second country for nine days and then to a third country for six days. He \nestimated that it cost him less than $5,000. (Tr. 175-177.) They took a single vacation on \na business trip to a U.S. state in the fall of 2023. Parts of that trip were covered by points. \nHe estimated that the vacation part personally cost him less than $4,000. (Tr. 177-178.) \nHe is referred to AE AA, which noted one vacation trip and others that were combined \nbusiness and vacation trips. He was asked whether taking those trips in any way impaired \nhis ability to pay his debts? He answered: \n[I]t did not because we were making payments for the garnishments \nand for the agreements we had with the IRS and we continued to make  \nthose payments through these vacations and business trips. So no, it did \nnot impact our ability to make the payments that we were either obligated \nto make or had agreed to make.

He is directed to GE 3 at 8, a personal \nfinancial statement (PFS). The exhibit is undated, and he did not know when he \ncompleted it. He received several interrogatories and does not know when he sent those \nback. Reviewing the undated PFS, he said there was very much he would change today. \nHe reiterated that he does not know when he completed the PFS. He consulted with his \nwife and said she prepared the PFS while he was at a work site. She sent it to him, he \nsigned and returned it. But he was often at that work site, so that does not help much. His \nAE T (2024 average monthly budget for him and spouse) is much more accurate and \ncurrent. (Tr. 178-183.) \nApplicant is asked again about his PFS. It reported his home equity to be $280,000. \nHe says it is more now. The PFS reported savings of $19,781. It is less than that now. By \nyear\u2019s end he expects it to be about $40,000. It is a joint account. The savings account \ntoday is $2,000 to $3,000. That is savings and checking. That account had $19,000 in \nabout 2019. He does not recall when the PFS interrogatory was received. Stocks and \nbonds are mostly in an IRA with about $400,000. Both cars were bought new in 2015. \nThey were $60,000 each and are now paid off. (Tr. 183-189.) \nApplicant was asked about EX 1T. Combined income is $16,638 plus $9,781 \n($26,419). Net salary is $14,292.81, after deductions for taxes and everything else. There \nare no deductions for garnishments, because they have all been satisfied. He and his \nspouse take $250 each from their IRAs. The net monthly remainder is $3,323 after \nexpenses. That goes into a savings account to pay taxes, for example the $1,000 per \nmonth to the IRS 2023 Plan that started in September 2023. The $3,300 extra will start \nbuilding up an emergency fund. They started this in February 2024. They recently filed \ntheir 2023 IRS and state income tax returns. They will get an estimated federal refund of \n$4,662. (Tr. 189-193.) They also have filed state and federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2018 through 2022. (AE AA.) \nPersonnel Evaluations \nApplicant submitted his 2023 Employer Performance Review, EX 1S. The following \nexcerpt is from the \u201cOverall Form Rating\u201d but is reflective of comments made in various \nsubparts of the Form: \n[Applicant] continues to be the go-to [engineer] for all things \nelectronic. . .

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to . . . pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \nThe SOR consumer debts are established by GE 4 and 5. The SOR tax debts are \nestablished by GE 2B. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConsumer Debts \nApplicant\u2019s four credit card delinquencies had their genesis in a home renovation \nproject that he began in or before 2016. His oldest son, his wife, and their newborn lived \nwith Applicant from 2016 to 2019. To prepare for that period, he converted his basement \ninto an apartment for them. His family had lived in that home since 2002, so the renovation \ncosts were higher than he had anticipated. The project continued through 2018. He used \nthe four SOR credit cards to help purchase the materials to complete the renovations. His \nson and family moved out in 2019. Applicant\u2019s four credit cards went into collections in \n2015, 2016, and 2020. \nI have considered mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (d). The project that \ncontributed to the credit card debt began in or before 2016 and was sufficiently complete \nto allow Applicant\u2019s oldest son and family to reside there in 2016. That was quite some \ntime ago. Although Applicant\u2019s two younger sons may marry and have children, the \nrenovation is now already available for them to use. So, the renovation costs are unlikely \nto recur. The birth of his first grandson was wholly beyond Applicant\u2019s control.

Here, Applicant exercised his own paternal judgment and \ncreated a home for his oldest son and family. I find that to be a wholly understandable \nand commonsense act of a father. There remain two questions. They are whether: (1) AG \n20(a) fully applies; and (2) AG 20(d) applies. \nApplicant paid off his four credit card debts in full through court garnishment, the \ntiming of which were not within his control. They were not prompted by the onset of his \nsecurity clearance process that began in 2021. By his March 2021 PSI, he was already \npaying at least one credit card by garnishment. As a general matter, court garnishment \n\u201crather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010). The Appeal Board, however, does not adjudicate \nsimply by affixing a label \u201cvoluntary\u201d or \u201cinvoluntary\u201d to a garnishment. In ISCR Case No. \n04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (Case No. 7360), the Government contended \nthat it was error for the administrative judge to favorably apply a mitigating condition to \nindividual debts that had been satisfied by garnishment. The Board held: \u201cApplicant was \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he had paid-off every debt in its original \nfull amount.\u201d It then held, looking at specific circumstances, that payment of two of four \ndebts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial concerns. \nIn Applicant\u2018s opinion, garnishment was an efficient way to pay off his full debt. \nApplicant said: \u201c[W]e did not oppose any of these garnishments.\u201d He explained: \u201cI did not \nwant to have any of these unpaid. So rather than accept the offer [of $5,500 to pay \n$15,754] to pay it off, we told them we wanted to pay off the entire amount.\u201d For another \ncredit card, he explained why he declined an offer to pay $4,242 for a $12,122 debt: \u201cI \nwanted to pay off the amounts owed in full. I felt if you owe the money, you should pay it \nin full.\u201d \nApplicant was asked if he had any defenses to the garnishments. He answered: \u201cI \ndon\u2019t understand your question . . . I didn\u2019t even think of opposing it, so I wouldn\u2019t even \nhave thought of any kind of defense.\u201d He did not consult an attorney. Finally, he was \nasked whether these were involuntary garnishments: \u201cIt was garnishment as done by \ncourt order. So I guess, yes, sir, I guess you can call that an involuntary garnishment . . . \nThe most direct way to pay off these debts was to make sure it came out of our pay.\u201d \nIn sum, Applicant did not understand \u201cdefenses,\u201d did not consult counsel, did not \noppose garnishment, did not want any bills unpaid, and believed he should pay the full \namount (even though Case No. 7360 held that was not required). The garnishments were \npaid out of his and his spouse\u2019s payroll. In fact, they used payroll deductions like an ACH \n(Automatic Clearinghouse) deduction. The creditors were made whole. To call this \ngarnishment \u201cinvoluntary\u201d elevates form over substance. The law is not that formulaic. \nI find that under these circumstances, Applicant demonstrated reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I also find that by not opposing and acquiescing in \ncourt garnishment and insisting on paying the full amounts due, he initiated and adhered \nto a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (d) apply to \nmitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through d.  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFederal Income Taxes \nApplicant traced his federal income tax problems to the filing of his return in 2019 \nfor tax year 2018. At the time, he and his family had lived in the same home since 2002, \nhad the same or higher income, same exemptions, dependents, and similar withholdings. \nHe followed the IRS instructions to calculate the amount of withholdings. His tax bill for \n2018, however, went from $11,422, for 2017 to $31,681 for 2018. His withholdings were \nnot enough to cover his 2018 tax obligations. That was unexpected and contrary to 16 \nyears of his and his spouse\u2019s federal income tax experience. And he had followed the \nIRS recommendations and guidelines. For tax year 2018, the Internal Revenue Code had \nundergone major changes, and they caught him up short. \nApplicant promptly addressed his tax problem by establishing the 2019 Plan in \nApril 2019. His efforts to clear up his income tax problem were not prompted by his \nsecurity clearance process, which would not begin until 2021. He paid under the 2019 \nPlan through July 15, 2021. In October 2021, the IRS used guidelines or rules and ended \nthe 2019 Plan. In September 2022, he paid $8,000 to the IRS to address those rules. \nThat made him eligible for a new payment plan. \nNow eligible for a new plan, in July 2023, Applicant signed a new IRS Plan (2023 \nPlan) to pay $1,000 per month beginning on September 15, 2023, for tax years 2018 \nthrough 2021. He is current under that Plan. He has filed state and federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2018 through 2023. The facts show that Applicant spent 2019, 2020, \n2021, 2022, and part of 2023 diligently trying to find the right formula of exemptions, \ndeductions, and installment plans with the IRS to bring his taxes into alignment with what \nhad become current tax law. All the scenarios they tried were valid, but he was always \nsix months to a year after the fact. They were \u201cchasing\u201d the right combination. Now, \nhowever, the 2023 Plan encompasses all remaining arrearages, and the end may be in \nsight. The 2023 Plan began in September 2023, and he is current on that Plan. I find that \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies and mitigates SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. There are two issues to be \naddressed here. \nFirst, at the hearing, Applicant was questioned about several vacation or \ncombination business/vacation trips abroad. After the hearing, he produced documents \nrelating to expenses of those trips. Those documents did not disclose anything unusual \nor untoward. At the hearing, he was specifically asked whether taking those trips in any \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________________ \nway impaired his ability to pay his debts? He answered: \u201cNo, it did not impact our ability \nto make the payments that we were either obligated to make or had agreed to make.\u201d \nSecond, Applicant submitted his 2023 Employer Performance Review. The \nexcerpt in the Findings of Fact show that he is held in high esteem by his employer. His \nemployer appreciates his mentorship of junior engineers. And he independently supports \nvarious efforts within the company. That review redounds to his credit. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 31, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company since September 2014. He currently works as project engineer supporting the U.S. Navy. He completed a security clearance application (SCA) in November 2017, in which he did not disclose any derogatory information. The July 2021 background investigation and the credit reports obtained in May 2021 and February 2022 revealed delinquent debts. The SOR alleges he is indebted to seven creditors for $124,866, and he failed to disclose the debts on his November 11, 2017 SCA. (GE 1-5; Tr. 17) Applicant graduated from college in May 2014, which he financed, in part, with the private loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($89,969). He obtained a master\u2019s degree in October 2017, which was financed by his employer. He earned a second master\u2019s degree in May 2023. At some point, he refinanced the loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for a lower interest rate. He did not realize at the time he was refinancing from a student-loan product into an installment-loan product with a credit union. Although Applicant was enrolled in a second graduate degree program between 2021 and 2023, the private loans did not qualify for non-payment deferment status.

Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 20, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility \n(DCSA CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nthe financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nDOD CAF adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended the case \nbe submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor a determination whether to revoke his security clearance.

I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) \nA and D, without objection. After the hearing, Applicant timely submitted AE E through \nS, which are also admitted without objection. (HE II) DOHA received the transcript on \nAugust 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 31, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company since \nSeptember 2014. He currently works as project engineer supporting the U.S. Navy. He \ncompleted a security clearance application (SCA) in November 2017, in which he did \nnot disclose any derogatory information. The July 2021 background investigation and \nthe credit reports obtained in May 2021 and February 2022 revealed delinquent debts. \nThe SOR alleges he is indebted to seven creditors for $124,866, and he failed to \ndisclose the debts on his November 11, 2017 SCA. (GE 1-5; Tr. 17) \nApplicant graduated from college in May 2014, which he financed, in part, with \nthe private loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($89,969). He obtained a master\u2019s degree in \nOctober 2017, which was financed by his employer. He earned a second master\u2019s \ndegree in May 2023. At some point, he refinanced the loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for a \nlower interest rate. He did not realize at the time he was refinancing from a student-loan \nproduct into an installment-loan product with a credit union. Although Applicant was \nenrolled in a second graduate degree program between 2021 and 2023, the private \nloans did not qualify for non-payment deferment status. He became unable to pay the \nloans and they were eventually placed in collection. (AE D; Tr. 16, 28-29, 54-55, 58-59) \nHe accepted a position with his employer with a $52,685 starting salary. The job \nrequired him to attend a one-year training program that required him to move from his \nhome state, State 1, to State 2. He did not receive any relocation assistance from his \nemployer. He financed the move with the credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($9,168). \nAfter the completion of the program, he was assigned to a position in State 3. He \nreceived a pay increase to $60,000. While in State 3, his grandfather became ill, and \nApplicant frequently traveled from State 3 to State 1 to spend time with him. He used \nthe credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($6,409) to pay for his travel. In 2016, his employer \nrelocated him to a location in Asia for a two-year assignment. He used the card alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,144) to pay off the deficiency balance on the car he had to surrender \nto the creditor before moving out of the country. (Tr. 19, 59-62) \nApplicant returned home in December 2016 to attend his grandfather\u2019s funeral. \nAfter returning to Asia, he began to deal with a medical issue and could not get proper \ntreatment. He returned home to State 1 in March 2017 for treatment and also took a \nthree-month leave of absence to address it. He financed his five flights back and forth to \nAsia with the credit cards alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,242) and 1.f ($3,008), which are \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nheld by the same creditor.

(Tr. 19-20, 61, 63-66) \nThe company relocated Applicant to State 4 in December 2017 in a position \nearning $72,000. When he moved to Asia, his employer moved Applicant\u2019s furniture into \nstorage. When he went to retrieve it, he found the furniture was unusable, and he had to \nreplace it. The contract for this position ended in March 2018. He found another position \nwith the company in State 1, earning $75,000. He relocated in April 2018, breaking his \nlease in State 4. He used the credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g to purchase new items \nfor his new place in State 4 and to move back to State 1. (Tr. 21-22, 66-68, 71) \nIn State 1, Applicant lived in a city with a high cost of living and could not afford \nto pay his living expenses and his debt. In his July 2021 interview with a background \ninvestigator, he explained the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c., 1.d. and 1.f became \ndelinquent in late 2018. The interest rates on the credit cards were high, making the \nmonthly payments unaffordable. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e became delinquent in \n2019. At the time of the subject interview, the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was 60 \ndays past due but has since been made current and is in good standing. (GE 2.; Tr. 22, \n69) \nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, Applicant received permission to move back to \nhis hometown in State 1, reducing his living expenses significantly. His salary has also \nincreased. He now earns $116,000 annually. He is using the increase in his salary, the \n$1,000 monthly he saves due to reduced living expenses, as well as the $800 in \nsupplemental income from his second job to pay down his delinquent debt. (AE \nB,C,E,S; Tr. 24, 26-27,71-72) \nApplicant has taken financial literacy offered by financial coach Dave Ramsey. \nHe has also taken a class with his church.

(Tr. 30) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges Applicant intentionally falsified his November 23, 2017 SCA \nbecause he failed to disclose the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g as \ndelinquent in response to Section 26: Financial Record. The record does not support \nthis allegation. There is no evidence in the record to establish that any of the alleged \ndebts were delinquent in November 2017. The earliest financial evidence in the record \nis dated July 15, 2021, Applicant\u2019s first interview with a background investigator. He \ntestified the alleged debts did not start becoming delinquent until late 2018. The two \ncredit reports in the record are dated May 2021 (GE 4) and February 2022 (GE 5), \nrespectively. Neither credit report indicates delinquencies on the alleged accounts \nbefore November 2019. There is no evidence the debts were delinquent or otherwise \nrequired reporting when he completed his SCA. Accordingly, the personal conduct \nallegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFinancial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleged that Applicant owed $124,866 on \nseven delinquent accounts. The debts started becoming delinquent in approximately \n2018 or 2019. The record supports the application of the following financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record also supports the application of the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not incur debt under circumstances that indicate irresponsible or \nreckless behavior. When his work situation stabilized in 2018, he made significant life \nchanges to address his financial situation. Since then, he has made progress toward \nreducing his delinquent debt and reducing his total debt amount by $12,573 or 10%. He \nhas demonstrated a track record of debt repayment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Here, Applicant\u2019s financial problems do not \nraise any behavior that indicates poor self-control, or an intentional unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations that may hinder his ability to properly handle or safeguard \nclassified information. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a \nwhole supports a conclusion that the security concerns raised under the financial \nconsiderations guideline are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 24, 2021, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories \nrequesting her verification of a summary report of an earlier interview she had with the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as well as certain federal and state income \ntax information. She responded to those interrogatories on August 31, 2022.

He claimed that prior to June 2018 he referred those issues to a \nnationally known income tax preparation company to review, and he intended to file the \nreturns by the end of July 2018. (GE 1 at 44-46) However, during an interview with an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on October 23, 2018, \nit was revealed that one particular state had indicated that he owed $158,000 in income \ntaxes for 2015 alone, and that he had not filed his individual state income tax returns for \nthe tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. Applicant disputed those allegations, claiming that \nhe had filed those returns. The state also told him that he had to file income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. (GE 6 at 4-5) He acknowledged that the IRS had \nconducted audits in 2009-2010, and finalized the audits in 2012. In fact, because \nApplicant owed unpaid income taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and/or the \nstate, at least two federal tax liens and one state tax lien were filed against him. As of the \ndate the SOR was issued in August 2021, he was indebted to the federal government for \ndelinquent taxes for multiple years. As for the federal or state income tax returns that had \nnot been timely filed, all those unfiled income tax returns had been filed in early 2019. (Tr. \nat 76) \nApplicant explained that because he frequently traveled, his wife handled the \nfamily finances. (Tr. at 57) He also contended that his partner Mr. P was responsible for \nthe business operations of their Chapter S Corporation \u2013 an organization that had \napproximately 65 employees at one point, but by 2014 had dropped down to 4 employees \n\u2013 and Applicant and his first wife were partners as well. (Tr. at 69-71) He used \nprofessional tax preparers for both the corporate and individual income taxes. In January \n2015, when the IRS started investigating the company, according to Applicant, Mr. P \ndestroyed all the corporate records. (Tr. at 96) As a result, Applicant was unable to submit \nany of the S Corporation income tax documents for my review. (Tr. at 112) Although \nApplicant tried working with the IRS, his request for a payment plan was rejected. It also \nrefused any person-to-person discussions. Mr. P was also a target of the IRS. Applicant\u2019s \nwife sought innocent spouse status. Applicant initially said that he was in a dark place at \nthe time and attributed at least some of the problems to his divorce and his need to pay \nchild support and alimony. (Tr. at 75) He subsequently acknowledged that the divorce \nreally did not have anything to do with his failure to file his income tax returns or his failure \nto pay his taxes. (Tr. at 111)  \nApplicant claimed to have made some payments to both the IRS and one particular \nstate, and intends to pay what he owes regardless of how long it takes. (Tr. at 103-104) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \nAlthough he and his attorneys made numerous efforts to deal with several IRS \nrepresentatives, the COVID-19 pandemic health protocols and reduced workforce limited \nhis access and purportedly restricted his rights under the Taxpayers Bill of Rights. He \nmade several attempts to lower garnishment amounts because the amounts being taken \nfrom him was creating severe financial hardships and he did not have enough funds to \nmaintain his basic living standards. (AE N) \nThe SOR alleged ten different financial issues associated with his failure to either \ntimely file federal or state income tax returns or pay income taxes over a multi-year period, \nas well as that federal or state tax liens had been filed, as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a federal tax lien entered against Applicant in multiple states \nin January 2021 in the approximate amount of $884,063. (GE 3) The amount covers \nunpaid tax for the tax years 2009 through 2013 as well as statutory additions. (GE 2 Notice \nof Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income (Form 668-W), dated February 3, 2021); \nGE 5) Applicant claimed that the business was audited for 2009 and 2010 taxes, and it \nwas completed in 2013, when the company was assessed $884,063. Of that amount, he \nclaimed that 51 percent ($450,872.13) should be his responsibility with the remaining 49 \npercent the responsibility of his business partner. Of Applicant\u2019s 51 percent, he felt that \none-half of that amount ($225,436.07) should be his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. He initially \ncontended that he paid more than $70,000 of the money owed, and has the assistance \nof attorneys to represent him with the IRS. (Answer to SOR at 1) He is in the process of \nresolving the lien. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to the 2009 federal income tax that is alleged as being delinquent \nin the amount of $314,318. Applicant applied for and received an automatic extension of \ntime to file his Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040) and it was extended until \nOctober 15, 2010. Calculations by his tax preparer were not completed until November \n3, 2010, and it estimated an adjusted gross income of -$167,976 and that he was owed \na refund of $93,919. (GE 7 at 24, 29-31) The delinquent tax liability is also included in the \nForm 668-W referred to, and alleged in, SOR \u00b6 1.a. During the period November 29, \n2021, through September 28, 2022, he made 17 monthly $2,775 payments to the IRS, \ntotaling $47,175, supported by verifying documentation. (AE H) He is in the process of \nresolving the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to the 2010 federal income tax that is alleged as being delinquent \nin the amount of $525,157. It is unclear if Applicant applied for an automatic extension of \ntime to file his Form 1040, but it appears that he did so because the copy is dated by the \ntax preparer on October 15, 2011. (GE 7 at 151) Nevertheless, calculations by his tax \npreparer estimated an adjusted gross income of $314,015 and that he owed an additional \n$25,885 in income tax. (GE 7 at 85, 151) The delinquent tax liability is also included in \nthe Form 668-W referred to, and alleged in, SOR \u00b6 1.a.  During the period February 10, \n2021, through October 12, 2021, he made 19 monthly (between $380.11 and $5,104.44) \npayments to the IRS, totaling $82,072.32, supported by verifying documentation.

(Tr. at 45-52) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2016, \nand his state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. In addition, \nbecause he failed to pay his federal and state income taxes for a multi-year period, federal \nand state tax liens were entered against him. The federal tax lien was in the approximate \namount of $884,063, and the state tax lien was in the approximate amount of $147,353. \nThe IRS levy resulted in substantial amounts of money being taken from his salary, but \nthere is still a large unpaid balance remaining. The state lien was released in November \n2019 when Applicant paid it off. On February 22, 2019 \u2013 well before the SOR was issued \n\u2013 Applicant\u2019s tax preparer completed that 2016 federal income tax return and submitted \nit to the IRS. Applicant\u2019s explanation regarding the late filing of the income tax return is \nnot a legal justification for inaction. Likewise, while the state income tax returns for the \ntax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 were finally filed on February 28, 2019 \u2013 also well before \nthe SOR was issued \u2013 they were still not timely filed. \nThe legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an \nindividual\u2019s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that \nthere is an obligation to so file, the following applies: \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or \nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make \na return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to \npay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or \nsupply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, \nshall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than \n$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more \nthan 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.

In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the \nfirst sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \n\"misdemeanor\" and \"5 years\" for \"1 year.\" \n(26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax.) \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),19(c), and 19(f) have been established, but there is no evidence that \nApplicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \n\u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) partially apply.

Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). This case involves two \nseparate financial issues: the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, \nand the failure to pay federal and state income taxes. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues essentially to a combination of factors. He \ninitially claimed that his business partner Mr. P was responsible, and then referred to \nbeing in a dark place because of marital issues that eventually led him to have to pay \nalimony and child support. Added to the mix was the IRS\u2019s refusal to meet personally with \nhim or his attorneys to discuss the federal tax issues and the COVID-19 protocols that \ncaused months to pass without significant discussions. Even if he did not have sufficient \nfunds to pay his income taxes, he was still required to timely file his income tax returns. \nApplicant should have been aware that as far back as before 2009, there were income \ntax issues. He should have been more attentive to those issues at that time. Instead, he \nsimply permitted the process to remain unchanged with Mr. P handling the finances and \nhis tax preparer continuing to file (or not file) various corporate and individual income tax \nreturns without more substantial oversight. Applicant\u2019s failure to more timely address his \nfederal and state income tax issues lead to a conclusion that his delayed voluntary actions \nor longstanding inaction until 2019 were to some degree irresponsible. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). In \nthis instance, Applicant completed his SF 86 in June 2018; underwent his OPM interview \nin October 2018. Yet, it was not until February 2019 that he filed the delinquent federal \nand state income tax returns. The SOR was issued on August 13, 2021. Each step of the \ninitial security clearance eligibility review process placed him on notice of the significance \nof the financial issues confronting him. By failing to rectify the status of his federal and \nstate income tax return filings over such a lengthy multi-year period, Applicant failed to \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. While the IRS and the state governments filed tax liens \nagainst him, Applicant is credited with the timely payment of taxes to release the state tax \nlien in November 2019 \u2013 also well before the SOR was issued. However, because the \nfederal tax lien was so incredibly high, the IRS levied against his wages and took \nsignificant amounts from him each month. But he still owes a substantial amount of unpaid \nincome taxes. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).

Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are some promises, along \nwith substantial involuntary payments and some voluntary payments. \nSeveral years ago, well before the SOR was issued, Applicant started the effort to \naddress his financial issues. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and health \nprotocols, as well as manpower shortages at the IRS, meaningful discussions between \nApplicant\u2019s attorneys, accountants, and the IRS were seemingly impossible. As noticed \nabove, while there were issues involving the individual income tax returns, there were no \ndocuments associated with the S Corporation offered into evidence, and it is unclear if \nthe IRS was concerned with those income tax returns or merely with the individual income \ntax returns. Still, Applicant was able to partially address his financial issues. The Appeal \nBoard has previously commented on such a situation: \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is evidence of financial counseling and a budget. Nevertheless, it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen because of continuing difficulties in making his monthly payments under the federal \ntax levy. While, in this instance, the IRS did not furnish guidance or afford access to a \nreasonable degree because of the national health pandemic issues, Applicant\u2019s actions, \nor inaction, for such a long period between 2009 and 2019, under the circumstances cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept regarding \nApplicant\u2019s financial considerations. Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense \ncontractor. He has been serving as a senior geospatial subject matter expert with his \ncurrent employer since about October 2017. He was a self-employed consultant from \nJanuary 2016 until October 2017, and from December 2001 until December 2015, he was \nthe president and chief executive officer of his own company, a Chapter S Corporation. \nHe was previously a program manager with another federal contractor from December \n1997 until December 2001. A 1978 high school graduate, he earned approximately 165 \nhours towards a college degree, but he has not earned that degree. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Army in August 1978, and served on active duty until January 1990, when he was \nhonorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-6). He has been granted a variety of security \nclearances (secret, top secret, and SCI) since about 1978. He is a well-respected \ngeospatial subject matter expert who has served on the front line with deployed troops. \nHe self-reported income tax problems and made some efforts to resolve them, eventually \nfiling all his delinquent federal and state income tax returns, satisfying a state tax lien, \ntrying to deal with the IRS during the COVID-19 pandemic, and paying substantial sums \nto the IRS to resolve his federal tax lien. He may have been the victim of inappropriate \nfinancial actions by his former business partner. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \u2013 not \nmuch more \u2013 substantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for \nthe tax year 2016, and his state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and \n2017. In addition, because he failed to pay his federal and state income taxes for a multi-\nyear period, federal and state tax liens were entered against him. The federal tax lien was \nin the approximate amount of $884,063, and the state tax lien was in the approximate \namount of $147,353. The IRS levy resulted in substantial amounts of money being taken \nfrom his salary, but there is still a large unpaid balance remaining. The state lien was \nreleased in November 2019 when Applicant paid it off. On February 22, 2019 \u2013 well before \nthe SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant\u2019s tax preparer completed that 2016 federal income tax \nreturn and submitted it to the IRS. Applicant\u2019s explanation regarding the late filing of the \nincome tax return is not a legal justification for inaction. Likewise, while the state income \ntax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 were finally filed on February 28, 2019 \n\u2013 also well before the SOR was issued \u2013 they were still not timely filed. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts is \ngrowing and improving. However, while some of his recent efforts have been reasonable, \npositive, and encouraging, his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nuntil 2019 \u2013 well before the pandemic appeared \u2013 was not reasonable. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. \nA, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n16 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 40, has worked for a federal contracting company since July 2019. He was initially granted access to classified information in November 2012, in connection with his military service. He served in the U.S. Navy from March 2013 to October 2018. He completed his most recent security application in March 2020, disclosing that he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2018. He also disclosed two arrests for possession of marijuana in January 2004 and November 2019. The ensuing investigation revealed that he failed to file federal and state income tax returns for the 2018 through 2021 tax years and that he had one delinquent account for $2,449. These issues are alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 14-16; GE 1-2) Applicant\u2019s problems began in October 2018 when he separated from the Navy. He did so because his wife wanted him to leave the military so that they could start a business together. However, shortly after he separated from the Navy, she left the marriage and stopped talking to him. Despite his desire to reconcile, the couple divorced in December 2019. He was devastated. Around the same time, Applicant\u2019s mother became severely ill. He believed that her condition was terminal. She was able to recover after undergoing a major surgery, which required one year of recovery. During this time, Applicant took primary responsibility for her personal and financial issues, including the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ($2,449, SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Tr. 18, 20",

The SOR is amended as \nfollows: \n1.d You failed to timely file your Federal income tax returns as required for \nthe 2022 tax year. \nApplicant admitted the allegation. (Tr. 34-38) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 40, has worked for a federal contracting company since July 2019. He \nwas initially granted access to classified information in November 2012, in connection \nwith his military service. He served in the U.S. Navy from March 2013 to October 2018. \nHe completed his most recent security application in March 2020, disclosing that he \nfailed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2018. He also disclosed two \narrests for possession of marijuana in January 2004 and November 2019. The ensuing \ninvestigation revealed that he failed to file federal and state income tax returns for the \n2018 through 2021 tax years and that he had one delinquent account for $2,449. These \nissues are alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 14-16; GE 1-2) \nApplicant\u2019s problems began in October 2018 when he separated from the Navy. \nHe did so because his wife wanted him to leave the military so that they could start a \nbusiness together. However, shortly after he separated from the Navy, she left the \nmarriage and stopped talking to him. Despite his desire to reconcile, the couple \ndivorced in December 2019. He was devastated. Around the same time, Applicant\u2019s \nmother became severely ill. He believed that her condition was terminal. She was able \nto recover after undergoing a major surgery, which required one year of recovery. \nDuring this time, Applicant took primary responsibility for her personal and financial \nissues, including the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ($2,449, SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Tr. 18, 20-\n21, 27-28, 50-51, 62-69) \nThe emotional distress from Applicant\u2019s separation, divorce, and his mother\u2019s \nillness left him preoccupied and contributed to his failure to file his federal and state \nincome taxes. He knew he did not owe additional tax liabilities, so he did not prioritize \nfiling his 2018 through 2022 federal and state income tax returns.

The 2018 federal income tax return, the 2021 and 2022 federal and \nstate income tax returns were filed after the hearing October 2023. He received refunds \nfor each of the returns filed.

(Tr. 18-19, 22-30, \n32\u201434, 38-42; AE A \u2013 N; HE II) \nApplicant used marijuana to cope with the stress in his personal life. Even though \nthe drug has been legalized in the state in which resides and can be purchased legally \nat dispensaries, he bought the drug \u201cfrom people in the street that I know in the \nneighborhood.\u201d He used the drug alone at home in the evenings after work. Though he \ndid not know his employer\u2019s drug policy, he was aware that marijuana use was not \npermitted. Although he was arrested for possession of marijuana while in college in \nJanuary 2004, he explained that he did not actually use marijuana for the first time until \nOctober 2019. During the January 2004 arrest, he was arrested with other students who \nwere gathered in a dorm room where some people were smoking marijuana. The \ncharge against Applicant was ultimately dismissed. (Tr. 19, 11-49, 51, 55-58, 60-61, 70) \nIn November 2019, Applicant was arrested for possession with intent to distribute \nmarijuana. He was traveling to a city in a neighboring state approximately three hours \naway from his home for legal proceedings related to his divorce. He was tired, pulled off \nthe road to relieve himself, and then fell asleep in his car. While he was napping, a \npolice officer approached his car. During a search of his car, the officer found less than \nhalf of an ounce of marijuana in a metal tin with some cigarettes in the center console. \nHe was initially charged with a misdemeanor, but the charge was downgraded to a civil \ncitation. In September 2020, he pleaded  nolo contendere and received a $25 fine, \nwhich he paid. He has not used the drug since his arrest, but he reported his last date of \nuse as December 2019 on his March 2020 security clearance application. (Tr. 17, 51-\n55; GE 4) \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant has indicated his intent not to \nuse marijuana in the future. He does not associate with other marijuana users. He \nbelieves he has developed better mechanisms for dealing with stress. He exercises \nmore and has found a group of trusted individuals in whom he confides and seeks \nadvice, including a men\u2019s group comprised of former military members. (Tr. 57-59, 71-\n72; GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.

The following financial considerations disqualifying conditions \napply: \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangement with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has since filed his outstanding federal and state income tax returns. He \nhas paid his one delinquent debt. The alleged financial issues were not the result of \nirresponsible spending or financial mismanagement, but the result of distraction \nbecause of the events in his personal life, and they do not negatively affect his ongoing \nsecurity worthiness. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raises questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). The record establishes that Applicant used \nmarijuana between October 2019 and November 2019 after being granted access to \nclassified information in November 2012. His possession of marijuana resulted in a \nNovember 2019 arrest, which the court resolved with a civil citation. He was previously \narrested in January 2004 for possession of marijuana. The following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and, \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \nreliability; and \nAG \u00b6 26 (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and,  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of nation security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for a limited time, 3 months, during a period of \nemotional distress. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana is serious, he does not have a history of \nmarijuana use and the use seems to be out of character. He self-reported the drug use, \nas required, on his March 2020 security clearance application. His last use occurred \nbefore he completed his security clearance application. He has not used the drug in four \nyears. He no longer associates with individuals who use marijuana. He has developed \nbetter coping mechanism for difficult emotions. His stated intent to abstain from use in \nthe future is credible. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant acknowledges his poor judgment in deciding to use illegal \ndrugs while holding a security clearance. It is not the purpose of a security clearance \ncase to punish or sanction a person for their past actions. Rather, it is a predictive risk \nassessment based on the past conduct. He is aware of the prohibition against such use \nas a clearance holder. By voluntarily disclosing his marijuana use, he has shown that he \nis likely to self-report adverse information even when doing so may be against his \npersonal, professional, and financial interests. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant  \nParagraph 2.

(GE 1; AE B: Tr. 25-26, 52-54) \nIn May 2014, Applicant was stopped by a local police officer after he was observed \nerratically operating a vehicle. He failed a field sobriety test, and a breathalyzer registered \na blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.152. He was arrested for DUI. He pled guilty in a state \ncourt and was placed on probation for six months, fined, had his driver\u2019s license \nsuspended for 90 days, and had an ignition interlock device installed in his vehicle for six \nmonths. He was required to complete an Air Force alcohol, drugs, and abuse prevention \ntreatment course, and received a letter of reprimand from his commander. (Answer; GE \n1-2; AE B; Tr. 20-21, 28-38, 56-57) \nBefore his 2014 arrest, Applicant had consumed an unrecalled quantity of alcohol \nin a bar.

He then made the admittedly poor decision to get into his truck and go \nto look for his cellphone. He pulled onto a road in front of a police car and proceeded to \nthe left turn lane. When the left turn light turned green, he remained stationary for about \nfive seconds, and the police officer pulled him over. (Tr. 20-21, 28-38, 56-57; AE B) \nIn February 2020, Applicant was stopped by a local police officer after he was \nobserved driving the wrong way on an access road. He told the police officer that he was \nnot familiar with the area, had three or four drinks that night, and that he had stopped \ndrinking 60-90 minutes before being pulled over. The police officer attempted to \nadminister a field sobriety test, but Applicant disputed some procedures and did not \nperform parts of the test, so the officer interpreted his actions as a refusal. Applicant was \narrested for DWI. He was administered two breathalyzers and registered a blood-alcohol \ncontent (BAC) of 0.147 and 0.150. In March 2021, a deferred adjudication was entered, \nand the charges were dismissed pursuant to the deferred adjudication in May 2022. He \nwas fined $500 and had an ignition interlock device placed on his vehicle. He completed \na DWI driver education program in May 2020, a state-mandated online alcohol education \nprogram in October 2020, and a 16-hour program in May 2022 that included counselling. \n(Answer; GE 3-4; Tr. 21, 38-44, 58-59) \nApplicant said he went out with friends for a few drinks and to reflect on his father\u2019s \ndeath. His friends wanted to go to a bar, and Applicant drove them. He consumed several \ndrinks over six or seven hours and said his last drink, a mixed drink, was stronger than \nhe had anticipated. After his DWI arrest, he refocused his life, disassociated himself from \nfriends who drank excessively and \u201cparty mode\u201d environments. (Tr. 61) He abstained from \nthe use of alcohol from February 2020 until June 2022. Since June 2022 he has \noccasionally consumed one to three beers or seltzers at social events, said that he has \nnot been intoxicated, and no longer drinks hard liquor. He said he has not driven after \nconsuming alcoholic beverages since February 2020 and has never been intoxicated at \nwork. (AE B; Tr. 21, 38-47, 58-62) \nCharacter letters from two of Applicant\u2019s former supervisors and long-term \ncolleagues praised his work ethic, expertise, positive attitude, trustworthiness, honesty, \nintegrity, loyalty, judgment, character, and favorable security clearance history. (AE A at \n3-5) A character letter from one former supervisor, an Air Force Major, noted his two DWIs \nwere out of character, that he was ashamed of his behavior, has owned up to his mistakes \nand worked to bounce back. (AE A at 3-4) Character letters from four of Applicant\u2019s \ncolleagues and long-term friends commented favorably on his work ethic, leadership, \nexpertise, loyalty, trustworthiness, compassion for others, commitment to mission and \ncountry, suitability for a security clearance, remorse for his alcohol-related incidents, and \nhis commitment to sobriety. (AE A at 6-9) Applicant\u2019s girlfriend of about 18 months, a \ngovernment employee and former spouse of an alcoholic, wrote that he disclosed his two \nDUIs on their first date and is remorseful for his actions, does not consume alcohol if \ndriving, and consumes no more than two drinks during occasional social interactions. She \nsaid he is responsible, has earned her trust, and always tries to take care of others.

He credibly responded to all questions \nand was keenly aware of the significance of additional alcohol-related incidents or \nmisconduct. \nPolicies \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \nJudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b), and (d) are established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents \nwere infrequent, occurred more than three and nine years ago, and are unlikely to recur. \nHe is sincerely remorseful for his errors in judgment and dedicated to not repeating those \nmistakes. He successfully completed probation, required alcohol education and \ncounseling. He has disassociated himself from alcohol-abusing acquaintances and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence and of modified alcohol \nconsumption. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe record evidence including Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b) and (d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, military \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nservice, work history, security clearance history, character letters, and modification of his \nconsumption of alcohol. Applicant was sincere and credible, and he understands the \nsignificance of any additional alcohol-related incidents or misconduct. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.
