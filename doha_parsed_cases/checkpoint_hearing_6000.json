Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 47 years old and has worked as a document specialist for a defense contractor\nsince August 2005. Prior to her current employment, she was unemployed for at least 18 months.\nDuring her period of unemployment, she did not take care of her financial obligations. Applicant has\n16 delinquent debts totaling about $16,479. She has not paid any of her creditors since she resumed\nemployment in 2005. Clearance is denied.\n\nItem 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated October 11, 2005).\n1\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 11, 2005, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nMarch 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised AG  was provided to Applicant\nwhen the SOR was issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement dated April 17, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On May\n3, 2007, Department counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items,\nand mailed Applicant a complete copy on May 4, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on May 7,\n2007, and had 30 days from receipt to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Applicant did not submit any information in response to the FORM. The case was\nassigned to me on July 19, 2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\nIn the FORM, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the SOR as follows:\n(1)  In subparagraph 1.d, replace \u201cCap 1 Bank\u201d with \u201cWFNNB.\u201d\n(2)  Strike subparagraph 1.g and replace with the following:  \n\u201cYou are indebted to Cap 1 Bank in the approximate amount of $912, for an account\ncharged off in September 2005. As of March 13, 2007, this debt had not been paid.\u201d\nIn the absence of an objection, the Government\u2019s request to amend the SOR is granted.\nAccordingly, the SOR is amended as stated above.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l of the SOR.\nThose admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of\nfact:\n\nItem 6 (Response to DOHA Interrogatories, signed on February 5, 2007).\n3\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer, dated April 17, 2007).\n4\nItem 5 (Credit Bureau Report, dated March 13, 2007).\n5\nItem 6, supra, note 3. \n6\n4\nApplicant is 47 years old and single. Since August 2005, she has worked as a document\nspecialist for a defense contractor. Applicant has a long history of financial problems going back to\n2003. Prior to her current job, she was unemployed for more than a year and developed a history of\nunpaid financial obligations.\nIn February 2007, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories related to her financial\nresponsibility.  She responded to her numerous delinquent debts and stated:\n3\nIt is my intent to start contacting the creditors and start paying off these accounts as\nsoon as possible. \nSince April, 2003, I have been unemployed approximately 1-1/2 years and have just\nestablished steady employment since August, 2005.\nI also have been helping my mother in the past few years, as much as possible for her\ncancer treatments, doctor visits, and medication.\nIn March 2007, the Government filed an SOR and alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.1\nthat Applicant had 16 delinquent debts totaling $16,479. Applicant admits all of the delinquent\ndebts.  Her delinquent debts are detailed in a credit bureau report, dated March 13, 2007.  The\n4\n5\naccounts in the credit report either are in collection or have been charged off, demonstrating their\nlong time delinquency. In the Interrogatories, Applicant questioned a charge for $5,931 and stated\nshe did not know the creditor. She admitted this debt in her Answer.\nApplicant\u2019s total net monthly income is approximately $2,447. Her total monthly expenses\nare $2,317. Her net remainder each month without paying on these debts is about $130.  She has no\n6\nassets or bank savings.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure two of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in\nevaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n7\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n9\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n12\nId.\n13\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n14\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n5\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n7\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n8\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n9\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.10\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.11\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n12\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n13\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n14\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\n\n6\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\u201d\nApplicant has a long history of financial problems going back to 2003. She has 16 delinquent\ndebts, totaling $16,479. The number of debts, the amount of indebtedness, and the period of the time\nthe debts have been delinquent indicate the Government has proved a prima facie case for financial\nconsiderations. Accordingly, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate Applicant\u2019s financial considerations security concerns. Applicant\nis in a precarious financial situation. Her net remainder each month without paying on these debts is\nabout $130. Moreover, Applicant cannot demonstrate that her financial problems are unlikely to recur.\nHence, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019 current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.\nApplicant states that she has been unemployed for at least a year and a half and is also helping her\nmother financially since her mother was diagnosed with cancer. Thus, \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant states that she would like to\ncontact creditors and arrange payment plans. These debts became delinquent in 2003. In August 2005,\nshe resumed employment and has not contacted any creditor to establish payment plans. She has not\ntaken advantage of counseling to assist her in handling her financial problems, especially in light of\nthe fact that she only has $130 remaining each month after her basic expenses are paid. Thus, \u00b6 20(c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control) and \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) do not apply. Allegations 1.a\nthrough 1.l of the SOR are decided against Applicant.\nHaving found for her on one mitigating condition, I now turn to the general factors of the whole\nperson concept. Applicant is 47 years old and has obviously had some financial setbacks in her life\nstarting around 2003. She is keenly aware of her delinquent debts. While she is sincere that she would\nlike to pay her outstanding obligations, she has no plan to date on how to accomplish that goal.\nFinancial counseling could assist her in resolving and understanding her precarious financial situation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

He denied the criminal conduct allegations relating to deliberate falsification of his SF 86 answers (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.d.,e.,and f.). He admitted all of the 11 financial allegations involving debts under Guideline F (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2.a.-l.) with explanations. He did not respond to the four personal conduct allegations under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 3.a.- d.) relating to falsification of material facts on his SF 86, to an investigator, and on an interrogatory.

Clearance is granted.  \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 27, \n2005. On August 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J, F, and \nE,  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 7, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on October 7, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 23, \n2007, and I received the case assignment on November 1, 2007. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on November 7, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nApril 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nNovember 27, 2007. The government offered 12 exhibits (Exh.), which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf and offered 13 \nexhibits which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.I) on December 5, 2007. The record was kept open at Applicant\u2019s request \nuntil January 9, 2007, to submit additional matters. On January 3, 2007, he submitted \nthree additional documents which were admitted without objection.  \n \n \nThe record remained open at the request of the government for submission of \nadditional evidence which occurred on February 13, 2007, by video teleconference \n(VTC). The transcript of that hearing was received on February 22, 2008 (Tr.II). An \nperiod of 30 days was given to Applicant to submit additional information. Five \ndocuments were received on March 18, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend Answer \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence indicated that he was \ncontesting one allegation concerning a 1997 conviction (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) that he had denied \nto investigators but admitted in his answer. I advised him of the inconsistency, and \nasked him if he wanted to amend his answer. He answered in the affirmative. The \ngovernment objected on the grounds that to do so would prejudice it\u2019s case as it was \nnot prepared to offer evidence on the allegation and wanted to do further research to \nproduce testimony and records (Tr.I 90-93 and 127). I granted Applicant\u2019s request to \namend with the condition that the government could move to re-open the case to offer \nevidence on the allegation if they chose to do so. A request to do so was timely made \nby the government and the matter was re-convened by VTC on January 13, 2008, to \nhear further testimony on that allegation. No additional testimony or records were \noffered by the government, but Applicant was cross-examined further on the allegation \nas well as other issues in the SOR.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the facts \nalleged in the three criminal conduct allegations relating to Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.a., \nb., and c.). He denied the criminal conduct allegations relating to deliberate falsification \nof his SF 86 answers (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.d.,e.,and f.). He admitted all of the 11 financial \nallegations involving debts under Guideline F (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2.a.-l.) with explanations. He did \nnot respond to the four personal conduct allegations under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 3.a.-\nd.) relating to falsification of material facts on his SF 86, to an investigator, and on an \ninterrogatory. At the hearing his attention was directed to the omission of a response to \nthis allegation in his Answer. He then denied them all (Tr.I 13).  \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a major defense contractor who has \nworked for the company since 1999 as a multi-disciplinary engineer. He has held a \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nsecurity clearance since he was hired. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering and a masters degree in computer information systems. He is highly \nregarded in his work by corporate supervisors and military clients who applaud his work \nethic and teamwork (Exhs. E-J). He has received several corporate awards for his \nservice on behalf of the company\u2019s military clients (Exhs. K and L). He worked in Kuwait \nand Iraq for five months in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Enduring Freedom for which \nsome of his awards were given. He finished his master\u2019s degree by correspondence \nduring his deployment.  \n \n \nIn addition to his employment in the defense industry, Applicant has been a lay \nassociate minister in his church for the past four years. He heads a young adult \nprogram for which he is responsible for budgeting and management. He also works with \nthe youth of the church. He is well-regarded for his character and reputation by his \npastor who testified for him and formerly worked for the same defense contractor (Tr. I \n110-118). He counseled Applicant concerning relations with his former girlfriend and \nbefore his marriage.  \n \n \nApplicant is also highly regarded by his pastor in his home city where he is still \nan associate minister and participates in services when he travels there. The pastor has \nknown Applicant and his family since his youth. He applauds him particularly for his \nwork with the youth in the community helping on various service projects for the church \n(Exh. B). He attempts to tithe 10% of his income to his church but does not achieve this \nevery month. He contributes between $100 and $300 each month.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in September 2006 to a chief master sergeant in the \nArmy. They have responsibility for his child from a former relationship and his wife\u2019s 16-\nyear-old daughter. He and his wife each have gross incomes of over $5,000 per month \nand maintain separate accounts. His net income after deductions is approximately half \nthat amount, which includes a deduction of $255 for student loans. In addition he pays \napproximately $600 for child care for his daughter. They own their own home and he \ndrives an older automobile on which he makes small monthly payments. \n \nCriminal Conduct  \n \n \nThe criminal allegations against Applicant in the SOR relate to two matters. The \nmost recent one (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) occurred in the city where he now lives on May 5, 2000, \nwhen he had a dispute with his girl friend at his home and was driving her home when \nthe argument continued. He parked the car, they got out and the argument continued \nand was a physical confrontation was observed by the police and a witness. He was \narrested and charged with an assault. He neglected to find out the date of the hearing \nwas cited for failure to appear (Exhs. 2 and 4). He was found guilty and at the \nsentencing was sentenced to 12 months probation and fined $50. He disputes some of \nthe underlying facts of the allegation but he was convicted and placed on probation \nwhich he fulfilled. He reported the matter at Question 26 of the SF 86. Applicant and his \ngirlfriend continued to live together for several years thereafter. They had one child in \n2004 for whom he paid child support until August 2006 when he obtained full custody of \nthe child who is now three years old. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \n \nThe second criminal conduct allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) is that he was arrested on \nApril 25,1997, in the capital city of another state where he grew up, was given a criminal \ntrespass warning, taken into custody for outstanding warrants, and admitted \nmembership in the Crips criminal gang. The police record (Exh. 5) indicates that the \ncase involved three men who had taken possession of an apartment where two women \ncomplainants lived. The men were selling drugs from the apartment and the \ncomplainants wanted the police to remove them from the premises. This is the \nallegation he denied to investigators but admitted in his answer to the SOR. He \nsubmitted exculpatory evidence at the hearing after he amended his answer to deny the \nallegation. The case was cleared administratively.  \n \n \nApplicant consistently denied this allegation at every opportunity in the security \nclearance investigation but without any of the evidence he produced at the hearing. The \nfirst denial was on September 12 and 13, 2005, when he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (Exh. 9). The second was in his \nanswer to an interrogatory on August 2, 2007 (Exh. 10). However, his denial of \nparticipation in this 1997 conduct was then alleged in cross-pleadings in two personal \nconduct allegations and two criminal conduct allegations as making false statements to \nan investigator (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.e. and 3.c.), and in an interrogatory response (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1. f. \nand 3.d.). His admission of the conduct in his answer was totally inconsistent with every \nstatement he had made concerning the 1997 incident up until that time.  \n \n \nThe exculpatory evidence offered at the hearing consisted of two affidavits. The \nfirst (Exh. D) is from Applicant\u2019s brother who admitted that he was one of the three \npersons arrested in 1997. He had used the Applicant\u2019s identity when arrested since he \nhad a long criminal record and was fearful of the consequences of another conviction. \nThus, the police record indicated Applicant\u2019s name and not his brother\u2019s name. The \nsecond affidavit (Exh. C) is from a cousin of both brothers who was in the group \narrested who supported the statement in the brother\u2019s affidavit that it was he and not \nApplicant was involved in the criminal conduct. Applicant was in engineering school on \nthe date of the arrest in a different city 150 miles from the place of the arrest. He was in \nthe third year of his electrical engineering studies and was taking final examinations in \nthe Spring of 1997.  \n \n \nApplicant did not learn of the 1997 incident until the documents relating to his \ncase were given to him during his background investigation (Exh. 5). When he learned \nof it, he thought the matter might involve a cousin who has the same first and last \nnames as Applicant with a middle name which phonetically is almost the same. Only \ntwo of the four letters in the middle name ;are different from his own (Tr.I 37). Confusion \nin identity between the two had occurred since they were children involving \nneighborhood offenses such as bicycle thefts.  \n \n \nApplicant attempted to reach his cousin which was difficult because the cousin \nwas in and out of jail during the time he was attempting to find him. However, Applicant \neventually learned he was mistaken in his assumption as to who was involved in the \nincident when he learned from another family member that the person involved in the \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nincident might be his own brother. He noted on the police report that one of the other \ntwo arrested in 1997 was yet another cousin. That cousin told Applicant that the person \nlisted with Applicant\u2019s name in the criminal report was Applicant\u2019s brother. When \nApplicant confronted his brother about the matter, he agreed to submit an affidavit to \nstraighten out the matter. Applicant has helped his brother over the years financially just \nas he has with other family members. He helped his brother once within the last six \nmonths. A second affidavit was submitted from the cousin who participated in the \noffense which confirmed that it was not Applicant who was involved but his brother.  \n \n \nA statement was admitted in evidence from a retired assistant chief of police and \nthe present assistant city manager for public safety of the capital city of the state where \nthe 1997 offense occurred. He has known Applicant and his family for many years. He \npraises Applicant and his parents, and describes Applicant as a very respectful person \nwith \u201chighest integrity.\u201d In addition, he describes applicant as a \u201cmodel citizen who is \n\u201chard working and honorable\u201d, and a \u201crole model to family and community\u201d (Exh. A).  \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe financial issues involve 11 alleged delinquent debts of Applicant totaling over \n$11,000. Of this amount $5,000 is for some of his student loans (SOR \u00b6 2. f. and g.). \nHis pay was garnished for a default on one student loan in November 2005 (Exh. M) \nafter his SF 86 was submitted. The total amount he owed in student loans for his two \ndegree programs was approximately $45,000. They were in multiple accounts including \nseveral on credit cards. He made monthly payments from June 2006 until January 2007 \nwhen a report was made on the payments (Exh. 12, Item 4). He applied to consolidate \nthese loans on March 1, 2007 (Tr. I 68). They were consolidated in August 2007 and \nare being paid in the amount of $255 per month with a voluntary assignment of funds \nfrom his pay.  \n \n \nThe other large debt is for an assessment of $3,800 by a former landlord (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.). It has been owed since August 2007 when Applicant moved from the apartment \ncomplex where he was a tenant. The manager claimed he had moved before his lease \nexpired but Applicant disputed the claim and the amount of the assessment. He settled \nthis debt for $2,500 which he paid by check on March 14, 2008 (Exh. P 4).  \n \n \nOther debts of Applicant are as follows:  \n \n1. A telephone bill for $559 (SOR \u00b6 2.h.) was disputed and deleted from his \naccount (Exh. N 2 and Tr. I 56).  \n \n2. Two debts to a local government office for $589 and $170 (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2.j. and k.) \nrelating to child support were canceled as shown by a letter from the collection \nagency (Exh. P 2). \n \n3. He settled a credit card debt of $915 (SOR \u00b6 2. e.) by payment of $631 on \nMarch 10, 2008 (Tr. I 59).  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n4. He paid a hospital bill (SOR \u00b6 2.d.) for $570 that became delinquent in August \n2007 and was acknowledged as paid in full by the creditor on December 17, \n2007 (Exh. N 3).  \n \n5. He has written to a credit agency for information about two other small medical \nbills totaling $68 (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 2.b. and c.) that he cannot identify (Exhs. O and P 1). \n \n6. He voluntarily supplied information about payment of two bills not listed on the \nSOR (Exh. P 1).  \n \n \n \n \n7. He submitted evidence in response to the security investiation interrogatory \n(Exh. 11) of payment and explanation as requested by a DOHA security \nspecialist of several debts which were not cited in the SOR since they were paid \nin February and March 2007.  \n \n \nThe payment and consolidation of these debts have reduced the amounts still \nowed by Applicant to only a few hundred dollars. He tried to refinance his home to be \nable to pay all the debts but his credit rating was too low. The actions taken to \ninvestigate, pay, or reduce these debts were not as timely as they might have been, but \nthe debts were confusing particularly the number and amounts of the student loan \ndebts.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nApplicant did not acknowledge seven of the eleven alleged delinquent debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and f.-k.) in response to Question 38 on his SF 86 relating to delinquent \ndebts of over 180 days for the past seven years (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). These concerned four \ncategories of debts, i.e. student loans, rental claim, a telephone bill, and to a county \ngovernment. He did not report the garnishment for student loan debt at Question 34 \n(SOR \u00b6 3.b.) since the garnishment was made in November 2005 six months after the \nSF 86 was filed. He denied the alleged 1997 criminal conduct to an investigator and in \nresponse to a DOHA interrogatory (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c. and d.). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for an \napplicant. One of them that may be a disqualifying condition (DC) is a single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses (AG \u00b6 31 (a)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n \nPossible mitigating factors under the guideline that could be applicable are that \nso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened that it does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 32 (a)), or \nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation including but not limited to passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record (AG \u00b6 \n32 (d)). The second mitigating factor raises the issue of rehabilitation. The domestic \nincident for which he was fined and placed on probation is the only offense that he has \ncommitted. He reconciled with the person, fathered her child, and now has full custody \nof the child. Applicant\u2019s conduct during the past seven years since 2000 has been \nwithout fault. This allegation is mitigated by the passage of time and evidence of \nrehabilitation.  \n \n \nApplicant has established to my satisfaction his lack of any involvement in the \n1997 incident. The government has implied (Tr.II 17) that his financial assistance to his \nbrother might have caused his brother to submit a false affidavit but there is nothing to \nestablish such a fact. He has helped other members of his family as well. The evidence \nintroduced at the hearing particularly from the senior public safety official and the family \nminister (Exhs. A and B), indicates strongly that the allegation of criminal activity in 1997 \nis clearly out of character with the life, behavior, reputation, and conduct of Applicant. \nHe was a university engineering student at the time in school 150 miles from the place \nof the incident. The affidavits of the two culprits in the crime, both members of his \nfamily, establish that he was not a participant in that criminal activity. I conclude that the \nallegation has been refuted.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay \nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ I find the \nbehavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it \ndoes not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has resolved most of the delinquent debts, either by \npayment or settlement. He is now on financially sound footing and prepared for future \ncontingencies. Despite delays in resolving some of the debts, he has made substantial \nprogress in doing so beginning with those he resolved in early 2007 while in discussion \nwith DOHA in his response to the interrogatory. I conclude that the mitigating conditions \napply.  \n \nGuideline E Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15:   \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout and an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15). \n \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire (AG \u00b6 16 (a)). Applicant\u2019s failure to report certain \nfinancial matters at Question 38 (Delinquent debts of over 180 days), and at Question \n34 (Wage Garnishments) on his SF 86, prompted security concerns under Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct). The evidence produced at the hearing showed that the wage \ngarnishment occurred November 17, 2005 (Exh. P 5) after the SF 86 was filed. Since I \nhave concluded that Applicant did not participate in the 1997 criminal conduct, I \nconclude in his favor on the allegations of false statements to a government investigator \nand in answers to an interrogatory denying the conduct.  \n \n \nThe failure to report seven of the delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and f.-k.) which \nrelate to three categories of debts, student loans, rental damages claim, telephone bill, \nand county government, was explained by Applicant as because he was in the process \nof consolidating the extensive student loans (Tr. I 74), was disputing the rental bill (Tr. I \n59 and 70), had a current account with the same phone company and had paid the debt \nin 200 (Tr. II 40, 41 and Exh. N-2), and that the county debts were related to child \nsupport payments which had been resolved (Tr.I 59 and Exh. P-5).  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n \nThe requirement of the guideline is that the omissions be deliberately false. I \nconclude that they were not.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. He has taken affirmative action to \npay or resolve most of the delinquent debts raising security concerns. (See AG & \n2(a)(6)). While some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise security \nconcerns (AG & 2(a)(1)). The 1997 criminal allegation has been shown to my \nsatisfaction to be in error. The 2000 offense has not recurred nor has any other criminal \nconduct and it is unlikely to happen again. He has show responsibility toward the victim \nof the 2000 offense and taken full responsibility for their child. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: For APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.j:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.k: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.l:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d: For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 20, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on June 27, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on July 5, 2007, scheduling the hearing for July 30, 2007.  At the\nhearing the Government presented one exhibit.  The Applicant presented no exhibits but did testify\non his own behalf.  The Government moved to amend the SOR to include an additional allegation\nunder 1(d.). (Tr. pp.59-60).  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibit and\nthe testimony.  The Applicant is 36 years old and has a high school diploma.  He is employed as a\nLaboratory Technician for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant is a native born United States citizen.  In May 2005, he married a woman who\nis a native born Chinese citizen.  The Applicant\u2019s wife has a daughter from a previous marriage who\nis also a native born Chinese citizen.  The Applicant, his wife and his fourteen year old step-daughter\nnow live together in the United States.  His wife and step-daughter are currently waiting for their\nresident cards.  (Tr. p. 32).\nThe Applicant\u2019s in-laws, including his wife\u2019s mother, father and sister, are all residents and\ncitizens of China.  They do not know that their daughter, the Applicant\u2019s wife, has married a United\nStates citizen.  The Applicant has never met his parents-in-law, or his wife\u2019s sister and his wife does\nnot want him to know them.  The Applicant explained that his wife told him that it would be a\ndisgrace to her parents if they were to find out that she divorced her first husband and married\nwithout their permission.  (Tr. pp. 36-37).  He does not know how they are supported or whether they\nget a pension from the Chinese government.  (Tr. p. 36).     \nThe Applicant initially met his wife during a business trip to China in September 2002.  They\ndated for three years before they were married and communicated by telephone on a daily basis.  The\nApplicant traveled to China in August 2002, October 2002, November 2002, November 2003,\nNovember 2004, March 2005 and May 2005.  (Tr. Pp. 21-24).  Three of his trips to China he paid\n\n3\nfor himself.  The others were required for business.  On each occasion, he stayed between three and\nfive weeks.  The Applicant states that he has never had any strange contacts with or been approached\nby any Government officials seeking information from him of any type during any of his trips to\nChina.  (Tr. pp. 23-24).  \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife maintains telephonic contact with her parents about twice a month.  She\nspeaks to her sister in China about twice a year.  The Applicant does not speak Chinese and does not\nunderstand the conversations his wife has with her parents and her sister.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife has significant assets in China.  His wife owns an apartment in China\nworth approximately $75,000.00, and investments in the Chinese stock market that total\napproximately $100,000.00.  The Applicant provides all of the financial support for his wife and\nstep-daughter.  He encourages his step-daughter to maintain regular and consistent contact with her\nfather who is also a resident and citizen of China.      \nI have taken administrative notice of the fact that China targets the United States for the\ncollection of classified information.  China has a poor human rights record, including arbitrary\narrests and detentions and torture of it prisoners.  China has a highly trained military and seeks to\nacquire United States technology through clandestine means, and it regularly conducts surveillance\nof visitors to its country.  Based upon the political climate in China, the security risk is elevated.  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U. S. interests, o r is vulnerable\nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, known to target United States citizens to obtain classified information and/or is associated\nwith a risk of terrorism.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n\n4\n7(a).  Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion; \n7(b).  Connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\n7(d).  Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of forcing inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \n \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\n\n5\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) that establishes\ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or\nnexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard\nclassified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates that he has foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Foreign\ncontacts raise legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the\ninterests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and\nhaving assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes\nthat the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's\nforeign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified\ninformation.  \nThe evidence establishes that the Applicant\u2019s wife and step-daughter remain close to their\nfamily in China.  His wife maintains close and continuing contact with both of her elderly parents\nand her sister in China.  The Applicant\u2019s step-daughter contacts her father in China on a regular\nbasis.  Since the Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents do not know that their daughter is married to the\nApplicant and have never met him, there is an essential part to this puzzle that is missing.  The\nApplicant does not know much about his parents-in-law or his sister-in-law.  He does not know\nwhether they are associated, if at all, with the Chinese Government.  Based upon this, the record does\nnot contain sufficient evidence in which to make a sound determination.  \nUnder Guideline B, Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion; 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\n\n6\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country\nby providing that information, and 7(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless\nof citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion apply.  The Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s close relationship with their\nforeign relatives who are citizens of and/or reside in China is a security concern for the United States\nGovernment.  Under the particular facts of this case, none of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nIn addition to the Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions, I have considered the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept.  The Applicant is newly married to a Chinese citizen.  He does not speak Chinese\nand does not understand the language.  His wife and her family speak Chinese on the telephone\nduring their regular contact with each other.  The Applicant does not understand the conversations.\nThe Applicant does know that his wife\u2019s contact with China is regular, constant and continuing.  She\nhas significant financial assets, including property and stock market investments, in China.  The\nApplicant\u2019s wife  has not broken any foreign ties with China.  The Applicant and his family are so\nclosely connected to China that this situation raises a potential security risk and Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence) is found against the Applicant.   \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly,\nhe has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    \nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant \n1.b.: Against the Applicant\n1.c.: Against the Applicant \n1.d.: Against the Applicant                                        \n                                                        \nDECISION\n \nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n\n7\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He answered the SOR 2 May 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned\n1\nthe case to me 20 June 2007 and I convened a hearing 27 July 2007. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) 8 August 2007.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate those admissions\nas findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old quality assurance manager, employed by a defense contractor since\nSeptember 1999. He has not previously held a clearance.\nApplicant was born in Burma (Myanmar) in December 1966. He came to the U.S. with his\nfamily in May 1979, when his father was appointed an executive director of the World Bank. He\nbecame a legal permanent resident (LPR) of the U.S. in 1990, and a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nOctober 1998. He  obtained his U.S. passport in November 2001. He has not had a Burmese passport\nsince before October 1998. Applicant attended schools in the U.S. from seventh grade on. He\nobtained an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a U.S. university, and earned a\nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration from a different U.S. university in June 2003.\nIn December 1997, Applicant married a Thai native he met in the U.S. She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen with him in October 1998. They have three children, all native-born U.S.\ncitizens. Applicant is a registered voter in the state where he resides (A.E. C). All his financial assets\nare in the U.S. He has substantial sums in his retirement accounts as well as two \u00a7529 state college\nsavings plan accounts he opened for his two oldest children (A.E. B). He has no financial interests\nin Burma.\nApplicant traveled to Burma in December 2004 to visit his family, and while there learned\nof medical issues confronting both parents. He returned to Burma in March 2005 to escort his mother\n(now 80 years old) and father (now 76 years old) to the U.S. for medical treatment. When in Burma,\nApplicant stays with his parents. He accompanied his parents back to Burma in 2006.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s parents and three siblings are resident citizens of Burma. His father was an\nexecutive director of the World Bank from 1979 until his retirement in 1992.  As such, he wore three\nhats. He was responsible to the bank, a non-governmental organization (NGO), the government of\nBurma, and the South-east Asia nations assigned to his region (Tr. 35-36). Notwithstanding this\ndivided responsibility, his retirement pension is paid by the World Bank. Before moving to the U.S.\nwith her family in 1979, Applicant\u2019s mother was a middle school principal\u2014a position that\nnominally made her an employee of the Burmese government. However, she retired from that\nposition in 1979, and although she earned a pension from that position, she does not collect it\nbecause the pension is less than the cost of traveling to the bank where she is required to collect it.\nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers is an airline pilot for a commercial airline in Burma, although\nhe had previously been employed by the state-owned airline. The other brother is mentally\nchallenged, does not work, and lives with his brother in Burma. Applicant\u2019s sister is a doctor in a\nprivate clinic. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings are casual and infrequent. None of Applicant\u2019s\nsiblings have any affiliation with the Burmese government.\nApplicant\u2019s program manager for the last seven years\u2014a retired career member of the U.S.\nArmy\u2014praises Applicant\u2019s work performance and integrity, and has no reservations about Applicant\nholding a clearance (A.E. A).\nBurma is a former British colony currently ruled by a military junta. U.S.\u2013Burma relations\nare strained. The government has an extremely poor human rights record, and is subject to a range\nof trade sanctions by the U.S. The government strictly controls travel to, from, and within Burma,\nand monitors the movements of foreign travelers staying in commercial establishments. U.S. citizens\ninvolved with Burmese pro-democracy leaders have been detained, arrested, tried, and\ndeported\u2014and are now subject to jail. Nevertheless, Burma is not a known collector of U.S.\nintelligence or sensitive economic information. Burma is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information.\nPOLICIES AND BURDENS\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n3\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.4\nIn this case, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B.\nConsidering first the foreign country involved, Burma and the U.S. enjoy strained foreign relations.\nThe government represses pro-democracy movements in Burma, and monitors foreign travelers,\nespecially those involved in pro-democracy activities. However, in order for Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers to be in a position to be used as a pressure point on Applicant\u2014whether benign or\nmalevolent\u2014there must be a government or other entity ready, willing, and able to collect protected\ninformation and use it. Burma is not known to target protected U.S. information, nor is it known to\ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. The government\u2019s focus appears to be on\nsuppressing internal opposition to the ruling junta. Nevertheless, the extent of government\nsurveillance poses some risk that Burma might seek protected information from Applicant.\nHowever, examining Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, whatever the heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of his limited family\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, . . . or the\n5\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests\nof the U.S.\n5\ncontacts in Burma, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.  His main contacts in Burma have\n5\nbeen with his parents, and have been related to their medical issues. There is no evidence that\nApplicant or his family members have been involved with pro-democracy groups in Burma, the main\nfocus of the Burmese government. Further, it does not appear that Applicant stayed in commercial\naccommodations while traveling to Burma, lowering the likelihood that he was monitored.

The Applicant is 57 years old and separated from her second husband. She is a Registered Nurse and is seeking to obtain a determination of trustworthiness in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a determination of trustworthiness, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country ahead of the United States. Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant was born in Egypt in 1951. She moved to Kuwait, where she married a man from Lebanon. Her two children were both born in Kuwait, but are Lebanese, not Kuwaiti, citizens.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 26, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office\n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant\nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD\nC3I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness\ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions as\ndefined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated\nJanuary of 1987.\nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) on September\n15, 2004.  (Government Exhibit 1.) On November 15, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\n\nThe Government did not submit to the Applicant or to me a proposed administrative notice document entitled\n2\nCRS Report for Congress: Lebanon (Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, dated October\n10, 2007.)  Department Counsel requested that I not consider statements in Government Exhibit 9 for\nIdentification that refer to this document.  That request was granted.  (Transcript at 31-33.)\n2\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and\neligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 28, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on April 8, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 9, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for May 19, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\neight exhibits, which were admitted without objection.  (Government Exhibits 1 through\n8.)  Government Exhibits 9 and 10 were marked for identification only.  The Applicant\npresented one exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A) and testified on her own behalf.  The\nrecord remained open to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  She\nsubmitted a statement that was received on June 3, 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  The\nofficial transcript (Tr.) was received on June 18, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive personal\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Lebanese Republic.\n(Transcript at 23-36.) The requests and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence, but were included in the record as Government Exhibits 9 (I through IX) and\n10 (I through XII) for Identification.   The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\n2\nFindings of Fact, below. \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 57 years old and separated from her\nsecond husband.  She is a Registered Nurse and is seeking to obtain a determination of\ntrustworthiness in connection with her employment.\n  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a determination of\ntrustworthiness, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons\n(SOR).  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon\ndue consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each\nparagraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country\nahead of the United States. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the\nexercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant was born in Egypt in 1951.  She moved to Kuwait, where she\nmarried a man from Lebanon.  Her two children were both born in Kuwait, but are\nLebanese, not Kuwaiti, citizens.  She is divorced from this husband.\nThe Applicant and her two children immigrated to the United States in 1983.\n(Government Exhibit 8 at 6-10.)  She became a naturalized American citizen in January\n1996.  (Government Exhibit 1, Section 3.).  Both children are Permanent Resident\nAliens in the United States (Government Exhibit 3 at 1, Exhibit 4 at 4, Exhibit 5 and\nExhibit 6; Transcript at 62-67.)  The Applicant does not believe herself to be a dual\ncitizen of Egypt and the United States.  (Transcript at 85.)\nThe Applicant had an active Egyptian passport that expired in 1999.\n(Government Exhibit 5.)  The Applicant was unable to find this expired Egyptian\npassport after the hearing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  \nThe Applicant also submitted her current American passport, which is valid from\n1999 until 2009.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  This passport shows that it was properly\nused by the Applicant to travel to Egypt in 2006, containing a visa from the Egyptian\ngovernment, as well as American and Egyptian entry and exit stamps.  (Government\n\nSOR subparagraph 2.a. was amended to read, \u201cYour brother is a citizen and resident of Egypt.\u201d  This\n3\ncomports with the evidence.  (Transcript at 61-62.)\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n4\nsupport of his request for administrative notice.  (Government Exhibit 9 for Identification and attachments.)\n4\nExhibit 4 at 11; Transcript at 56-57.)  Her American passport also showed entry and exit\nstamps from Egypt for trips in 2000 and 2001.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 6-14;\nTranscript at 68-73, 84-85.)\nThe Applicant brought her expired Egyptian passport with her on her trips to\nEgypt for two reasons.  First, Egyptian border authorities would identify the Applicant as\nbeing from Egypt because her American passport states her place of birth as Egypt.\nThey would then ask the Applicant to show her expired Egyptian passport, even though\nshe is an American citizen.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 7; Transcript at 59.)  Second, the\nApplicant received discounts in Egypt for lodging and visiting tourist sites by using her\nexpired Egyptian passport to show that she was once Egyptian.  Such discounts are not\navailable to people born outside Egypt.  (Transcript at 58-59.)\nThe Applicant has one surviving brother, who lives in Egypt and travels\nthroughout the Middle East.  She sees him during her visits to Egypt, and contacts her\n3\nbrother about once a month.  He has never travelled to the United States.  (Transcript at\n85-88.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s children are Lebanese in name only.  The father of her children\nabandoned the Applicant and her young family soon after she arrived in the United\nStates.  (Transcript at 49-50.)  Her 28 year old daughter last visited Lebanon over 25\nyears ago, when she was a very young child.  Her son has never visited Lebanon.  They\nhave visited Egypt, but not recently.  As stated above, both of the Applicant\u2019s children\nare Permanent Resident Aliens here in the United States.  Neither child speaks any\nlanguage but English and they are completely Americanized.  (Transcript at 74-77, 89-\n92.)  Under the particular facts of this case the relationship with Lebanon is so tenuous\nthat it has no current security significance.  Accordingly, subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c.\nare found for the Applicant.\nThe Applicant has contacts with Egypt.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to discuss\nthe relationship between Egypt and the United States at this time.   Egypt has been an\n4\norganized country for about 5,000 years.  The Arab Republic of Egypt is the most\npopulous country in the Arab world, with nearly 79 million people.  Life expectancy is 71\nyears.  It is a republic with a growing economy and a strong executive form of\ngovernment.  There is also an elected Parliament with some members appointed by the\nPresident of the Republic.  It has an appointed judiciary.  Egypt and the United States\nenjoy a strong and friendly relationship based on shared mutual interest in Middle East\npeace and stability, strengthening trade relations, and promoting regional security.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 9 for Identification at Attachment VI.\n5\n5\nHowever, the terrorist threat remains high in Egypt despite its pursuit of terrorists.\nAccording to the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy of the United States,\nterrorists use overt, covert and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine U.S.\nnational security interests.   Terrorist organizations currently target the United States for\n5\nintelligence collection through human espionage and by other means.  Egypt\u2019s human\nrights record is poor and serious abuses continue in many areas.  Torture, arbitrary\narrest, prolonged detention, poor prison conditions, denial of fair trial and lack of due\nprocess, executive branch limits on an independent judiciary, political prisoners and\ndetainees, and restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly and association are\nsome of the problem areas.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a determination of\ntrustworthiness because she has provided inconsistent information with regards to her\nson\u2019s citizenship and her last name.\nAs stated above, the Applicant\u2019s son was born in Kuwait, but is not a Kuwaiti\ncitizen.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity, accidentally identified the Applicant\u2019s son as being Kuwaiti on a single\ndocument.  That is no fault of the Applicant, who has consistently stated and shown her\nson as being Lebanese.  \nThere has been a lot of confusion concerning the Applicant\u2019s last name.  (See,\nfor example, caption to this SOR.)  Since this decision is redacted, I can merely state\nthat part of the name can be spelled with one or two \u201cM\u201ds.  The Applicant got used to\nusing two \u201cM\u201ds when writing her name, even though it \u201cofficially\u201d only has one.\nDepending on the document, her last name may be spelled one way or the other, and\noften it is not her fault.  Her current driver\u2019s license also uses the last name of her\nsecond husband, even though they are separated and she had her last name legally\nchanged. That is because the Applicant did not bring a copy of the order changing her\nname to the Department of Motor Vehicles when her license was last renewed.\n(Transcript at 78-83.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters of recommendation.  They show that the\nApplicant is respected by her employers and members of the Armed Forces she works\nwith.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\n\n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness determination, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive personal information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive personal information enters into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to such information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nsensitive personal information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such\ninformation.\n \n\n7\nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\nfinding of trustworthiness.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts\nto the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which\nis sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the\nultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him or her access.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant may have had a valid Egyptian passport in the recent past\n(Guideline C); that the Applicant has a family member overseas (Guideline B); and that\nshe has spelled her last name two different ways (Guideline E).  The Applicant, on the\nother hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nTurning first to Guideline C, the Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about her possession of an expired Egyptian passport after becoming an\nAmerican citizen.  The concern is stated thus under this Guideline, When an individual\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United\nStates, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe Applicant had a valid Egyptian passport after becoming an American citizen.\nHowever, at all times relevant to this decision, the passport had expired and she did not\nuse it for entry or exit from the United States.  Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) states:\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a)\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport. (Emphasis supplied.)  The\nApplicant\u2019s possession of an expired Egyptian passport does not come within the ambit\nof this Disqualifying Condition.  \nIn addition, it is particularly noteworthy that when she traveled to Egypt the\nApplicant made a point of presenting her United States passport to Egyptian authorities\nto be stamped.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the Applicant used her expired\nEgyptian passport in preference to her American passport.  Such conduct also shows\nthat she was not using the Egyptian passport to engage in unverifiable travel.\nFor all the reasons stated above, the Applicant has mitigated the concerns of\nParagraph 1 of the SOR.  Guideline C is found for the Applicant.\n\nAs stated above, subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c. are  found for the Applicant.\n6\n8\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant has faint family connections to Egypt, specifically a single brother.\nOther than her children\u2019s citizenship, an accident of birth, she has no connections to\nLebanon at all.   Her current family connections to Egypt, which consists of monthly\n6\ntelephone calls to her remaining brother, are tenuous at best.  Her trips to Egypt are\nconsistent with an American citizen visiting her other brother, who has passed away,\nduring his illness.\nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the Egyptian\ngovernment, and in particular the current stance of the United States with regard to\nEgypt.  Certainly, as shown by the Government, there have been concerns with Egypt in\nthe past.  However, as also abundantly shown by the same documents, the strategic\nstance between the United States and Egypt is one of strong friendship based on\nmutual interests in Middle East peace and stability.  Applicant has limited contact with\nher remaining brother in Egypt.  Her familial contacts are so infrequent that there is no\nrisk in them for Applicant to be the object of foreign influence or exploitation by Egypt.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Condition arguably applies to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family\nmember . . . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information. \nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given her particular background:\n\n9\n8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn conclusion, I have carefully considered the information concerning the\nEgyptian government and its relations with the United States, provided by Department\nCounsel, and the extent of the Applicant\u2019s contacts with Egypt.  After a review of all of\nthe information, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Federal Government, in a single form, confused the Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s place\nof birth (Kuwait) for his place of citizenship (Lebanon).  It is certainly not the Applicant\u2019s\nfault that Citizenship and Immigration Services got that fact wrong.  The Applicant has\nconsistently told the Government the truth.  \nThe Applicant spells her last name two different ways.  Other entities, including\nDOHA, also spell her last name two different ways.  While only one name, the one with\none \u201cM,\u201d is technically legal, this fact does not show an intent to deceive or a failure to\ncooperate.  Her driver\u2019s license is in her married name.  That is also not a sign that she\nis doing something illegal or improper.  \nDespite the Department Counsel\u2019s best efforts, and looked at in the manner most\nfavorable for the Government, there is no proper allegation here of poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability.  Human beings, and not just the Applicant, make\nmistakes.  That is all that has happened here.  Guideline E is found for the Applicant.\n Whole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n10\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The evidence shows that the\nApplicant is a patriotic American citizen.  The Applicant eloquently testified about the\nimportance of her family in the United States, and her pride in being an American citizen\nand working for the United States military.  I find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  Using the whole\nperson standard, the Applicant has mitigated the security significance of her foreign\nconnections and alleged foreign preference and is eligible for access to sensitive\npersonal information. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a sensitive Systems Position.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C: \nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs  2.a. through 2.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n11\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and\neligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\n_________________\nWILFORD H.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony. The Applicant is 41, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact. Guideline B - Foreign Influence The Applicant came to the U.S. in 1989, eight years prior to Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to China in 1997 (TR at page 20 line 15 to page 23 line 24).

Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 26, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on March 22, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on March 27, 2007, and the case was heard on April 16, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on April 26, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether\nthe Applicant's perceived Foreign Influence militates against the granting of a security clearance.\n[The Applicant admits the underlying facts of all of the allegations, to include an amended\nsubparagraph 1.d.  This subparagraph was amended to allege that Applicant\u2019s last visit to Hong\nKong was in 2006, and not in 2005 as originally alleged.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 41, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence\nin the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of\nfact.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant came to the U.S. in 1989, eight years prior to Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to China\nin 1997 (TR at page 20 line 15 to page 23 line 24).  He obtained a Ph.D. from an American\nuniversity in 1995 (TR at page 20 lines 5~14).  The Applicant was married in 1997 (TR at page 21\nlines 11~18).  He met his spouse at their church in the U.S. (Id).  He became a U.S. citizen in 2004\n(TR at page 22 lines 5~22).  His wife and two children are all Americans (TR at page 22 line 23 to\npage 23 line 23).\n1.a., and 1.d.  The Applicant\u2019s 72 year old mother is a citizen of and lives in Hong Kong (TR\nat page 24 line 15 to page 25 line 19).  She never worked for the Hong Kong or Chinese\ngovernments, nor was she ever a member of the Communist Party (TR at page 28 line 10 to page 29\nline 23).  When she dies, the Applicant stands to inherit property in Hong Kong worth about\n$30,000~$40,000 (TR at page 47 line 23 to page 49 line 8).  This pales in comparison to his net\nworth in the U.S. of over $800,000 (TR at page 51 lines 5~22).\nThe Applicant traveled to Hong Kong in 2000 and 2002, to visit his parents (TR at page 25\n\n4\nline 20 to page 27 line 4).  He traveled to Hong Kong twice in 2003, once to attend his father\u2019s\nfuneral (Id).  The last time the Applicant visited Hong Kong was in 2006, to visit his mother (TR at\npage 25 line 20 to page 27 line 4).\n1.b.  The Applicant has two sisters who reside in Hong Kong (Government Exhibit (GX) 1\nat page 4).  His oldest sister is a British national, and is employed \u201cas a part-time nurse in a hospital\u201d\n(TR at page 31 lines 8~24).  His younger sister is a citizen of Hong Kong, and is employed as \u201ca\nHigh School teacher\u201d (TR at page 34 lines 4~10).  Neither of his sisters is a member of the\nCommunist Party (TR at page 30 line 23 to page 38 line 19).  Both sisters are seeking to emigrate\nfrom Hong Kong to the U.S.; and as such, have applied for permanent resident status in the U.S. (TR\nat page 53 lines 6~15).\n1.c.  The Applicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens of Hong Kong, but reside in China, where the cost\nof living is cheaper (TR at page 39 line 15 to page 42 line 9).  They are both retired, and have never\nworked for the Hong Kong or Chinese governments (TR at page 43 line 20 to page 44 line 13).\nThe Applicant would report any attempt at coercion vis-a-vis any of his foreign relatives to\nthe appropriate authorities (TR at page 52 line 11 to page 53 line 5).\nAs all of the Applicant\u2019s relatives, except for his oldest sister, are citizens of Hong Kong, the\nSpecial Administrative Region must be considered.  Hong Kong is one of the world\u2019s most open and\ndynamic economies.  In July of 1997, China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,\nending 150 years of British Colonial rule.  Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy in all matters,\nexcept for foreign and defense affairs.  Hong Kong will retain its political, economic, and judicial\nsystems and unique way of life for 50 years after reversion and will continue to participate in\ninternational agreements and organizations under the name, \u201cHong Kong, China.\u201d\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\n\n5\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who is subject to Foreign Influence, may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able\nto place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant's mother, and two sisters reside in Hong Kong.  He also has in-laws who\nreside in China.  The first and second disqualifying conditions are arguably applicable as this contact\n\u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\"\nand creates \u201ca potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that\ninformation.\u201d  Under the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first\nand second mitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Hong Kong\nrelatives is \u201csuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of . . . [his family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nNot alleged; but argued by the Government, is the Applicant\u2019s potential $30,000~$40,000\nproperty interest in Hong Kong.  This is not \u201ca substantial . . . property interest in a foreign country,\u201d\nas required by the fifth disqualifying condition.  If it were, however, it pales in comparison to his\nover $800,000 in net worth in the U.S.  Clearly, under the last mitigating condition, \u201cthe value of .\n\n6\n. . [the] property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant\u2019s church\nminister speaks most highly of him (Appellant\u2019s Exhibit B).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct\nand circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation under\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline B is found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nperceived Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B,\nand of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion\nunder Guideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

On January 30, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 27, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that she was\nvulnerable to foreign influence because Applicant\u2019s father does not hold a high-level job in the\nTaiwanese government.  Rather, he is an ordinary public affairs officer responsible for furthering\nTaiwan\u2019s cultural interests.  As part of her brief, Applicant offers new evidence which indicates that\nher father intends to immigrate to the United States and retire here, and that she has applied for a visa\non his behalf.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n23748 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 11, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Thus, Applicant had the burden of presenting\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts that the Department Counsel proved or that\nApplicant admitted regarding her foreign family ties.  Applicant also had the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge\nhad to evaluate Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the\nDirective, and decide whether Applicant had met her burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe fact that Applicant\u2019s explanations and her mitigating evidence did not lead the Judge to the\ndecision desired by Applicant does not establish error.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant under Guideline C, and articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any\nmitigating conditions or factors with respect to the Guideline B allegations.  She reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing\nof a number of variables to reach a commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In some\ninstances, as noted earlier, this process led to favorable findings for Applicant.  However, the Judge\nalso articulated a reasonable concern that Applicant's circumstances could potentially make her\nvulnerable to foreign influence.  The security concern is based upon close family ties in Taiwan,\nconsidered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United\nStates.  Applicant offers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that\n\n3\nalternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13,\n2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for her unfavorable determination under the\ndisqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record\nevidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side\nof national security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-04371 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007). \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael D. Hipple      \nMichael D.

Concerns persist of undue foreign influence where Applicant's father is employed\nby the Taiwanese government and is a resident citizen of Taiwan. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on January 30, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nand Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. In an undated answer to the\nSOR, Applicant elected a decision based on the written record without a hearing. On May 23, 2007,\nApplicant requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge, and the case was assigned to\nme on June 29, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on August 22, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. One government exhibit (Ex.\n1), Applicant's security clearance application, was admitted, and testimony was taken from\nApplicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 5, 2007.\nThe record was held open until September 12, 2007, for Applicant to submit documentation,\nincluding information about her father's employment duties and/or the expiration of her Taiwanese\npassport. By facsimile on September 12, 2007, Applicant timely submitted information from the\nwebsite of a Taiwanese government office (Ex. A), as well as extracts from her Taiwanese passport\n(Ex. B) and U.S. passport (Ex. C). Department Counsel filed a response on September 25, 2007,\nindicating the government had no objections, and the documents were admitted.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn June 26, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC or China).  Authority\nto consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and evidence and\nshall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner).\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative\nproceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No.\n02-24875 (decided Oct. 12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative\njudge who took  administrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was\nprovided in advance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present\nalternative information for the judge to notice.\n\nThe documents for administrative notice are identified per the government\u2019s request of June 26, 2007, and not\n1\nas in the government\u2019s exhibit list presented at the hearing.\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated April 2007 (I), Background Note: China, dated January 2007 (VIII),\n2\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007 (XI), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated March 19, 2007 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n3\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (VII). The document was prepared for the\n4\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (III) and\n5\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (X). \nSee 2006 Report to Congress, November 2006 (IX).\n6\nThe press releases (IV) and (V) were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan actively pursues\n7\ncollection of U.S. economic and propriety information. Neither case involves Applicant personally. The April 18, 2006,\npress release (IV) concerns the sentencing of a U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft between December\n1999 and December 2001 to the benefit of a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no evidence that Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment was involved in, or sanctioned the criminal activity. The January 22, 2007 (V) press release concerns the\nsentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for, in part, making false statements to the government concerning\nhis relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer and by not reporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where\nhe met with the foreign intelligence officer.\nSee U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005 (VI). The\n8\ncourt records do not pertain to any criminal charge against Applicant.\nWhile a  Taiwanese intelligence official was implicated in cultivating a personal relationship with a U.S. State\n9\nDepartment official (VI), there is no indication that Applicant has ever been targeted.\n3\nApplicant objected to the relevance to her case of criminal wrongdoing perpetuated by other\nindividuals, as represented in the press releases (IV, V) and the district court document (VI).  Facts\n1\nare proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source and\nrelevant and material to the case. For source documentation the government relied on publications\nof the Department of State;  the Congressional Research Service;  the Centre for Counterintelligence\n2\n3\nand Security Studies;  the National Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of the\n4\nNational Counterintelligence Executive;  the U.S. China Economic and Security Review\n5\nCommission;  two press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice;  and a record of the U.S.\n6\n7\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.8\nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and\nmateriality of the facts proposed, I took administrative notice of certain facts as set forth below.9\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s father is a resident\ncitizen of Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), who works as an information officer for the Taiwanese government\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline C, foreign preference, Applicant was alleged to exercise dual\ncitizenship with Taiwan and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to have possessed a Taiwanese passport from\n\nApplicant testified that her father has worked for the same department for 23 years, since he graduated from\n10\ncollege. (Tr. 36) Her sister was born in the U.S. 26 years ago, so it may well be that he has worked for more than 23 years\nfor the Taiwanese government. She provided no alternative explanation for why her parents would have been in the U.S.\nin 1981.\nApparently, the United Kingdom does not confirm automatic citizenship to those born on U.K. soil (\u201c[H]e\n11\nwas born there but they have different laws, so just because you were born there doesn\u2019t mean you are a citizen, so his\ncitizenship is Taiwan.\u201d) Tr. 62 \n4\nabout 1983 to at least February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the Taiwanese residency and\ncitizenship of her father but denied he was employed as alleged. She also admitted dual citizenship\nwhile denying possession of a Taiwanese passport from 1983 to at least February 2006.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take\nadministrative notice, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems engineer II who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since October 2005. She earned bachelor of science degrees in two disciplines from a\nprivate prestigious technological university in the U.S., in electrical engineering and computer\nscience in June 2004  and in management science one year later. She seeks a security clearance for\nher present duties.\nApplicant\u2019s Background and Foreign Ties\nApplicant was born in the U.S. in February 1983 to Taiwanese native citizens. For at least\nthe last 23 years, her father has been employed in public affairs for the Taiwanese government as a\nsecretary.  Every few years, he is transferred to a different country where he publishes the positions\n10\nof, and disseminates information in the interests of the Taiwanese government. Applicant\u2019s parents\nwere temporarily in the U.S. for her father\u2019s job when Applicant and her sister (born in April 1981)\nwere born. Applicant and her sister have U.S. citizenship from birth and derivative Taiwanese\ncitizenship through their parents.\nWhen Applicant was ten months old, her father was recalled to Taiwan. Applicant resided\nin Taiwan until she was six, when her father was transferred to England. While living in England,\nApplicant\u2019s parents had a son, who was born in October 1990. Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen only\nof Taiwan.11\nIn about 1994, the family returned to the U.S. When Applicant was in high school, her father\nwas sent to Indonesia where he managed a small office of three public affairs personnel for the\nTaiwanese government. Applicant\u2019s mother remained in the U.S. with Applicant and her siblings\nso that they could attend school here.\nFrom August 26, 1998, to September 7, 1998, Applicant traveled to Taiwan to see her father\non a Taiwanese passport issued to her by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the\n\nApplicant testified she already had a U.S. passport when she obtained her Taiwanese passport (Tr. 36) The\n12\nonly U.S. passport in evidence (Ex. C) was issued after her Taiwanese passport (Ex. B), although she testified the current\npassport was \u201ca form renewal.\u201d (Tr. 75).\nIt is not clear whether she presented her U.S. passport or her Taiwanese passport to enter Indonesia on that\n13\ntrip as she submitted only the identifying information for her U.S. passport, and her Taiwanese passport bears stamps\nonly showing entry into, and exit from Taiwan in 2000.\nApplicant testified that every few years, Taiwan\u2019s public affairs office would pay for the family to fly to\n14\nTaiwan to visit her father. Applicant expressed her belief that the Taiwanese government paid for a one-way ticket for\nher in the summer of 2000 (Tr. 41), and on that trip, her mother used \u201ca special sort of identification\u201d which gained their\nentry into Taiwan (Tr. 42, 71). Applicant\u2019s Taiwanese passport bears stamps confirming she used her Taiwanese passport\nto both enter and exit Taiwan.\nApplicant testified to her recollection, she presented her Taiwanese passport when she left the U.S. The copies\n15\nof her now expired Taiwanese passport and of her current U.S. passport do not show any stamps from U.S. immigration\nofficials.\nAt her hearing, Applicant testified that her sister was also a dual citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan. (Tr. 55)\n16\n5\nU.S. on November 26, 1996. The passport was valid to November 26, 2002.  Her parents applied for\nthe Taiwanese passport for her because it would facilitate her travel to Asia.12\nOn March 8, 1999, Applicant was issued her U.S. passport. She has not used that passport\nfor foreign travel. Applicant traveled to Indonesia with her mother in July 2000 to see her father.13\nTheir plane fare was partially covered by the Taiwanese public affairs office.  Before they returned\n14\nto the U.S., Applicant and her mother stopped off in Taiwan to visit family members, including her\nmother\u2019s siblings. Applicant presented her Taiwanese passport to enter and exit Taiwan.15\nIn September 2000, Applicant began her undergraduate studies in the U.S. While in college,\nshe used her U.S. passport as an identity card to travel on the airline shuttle between her home and\ncollege as she did  not have a driver\u2019s license at the time. On her graduation from college, Applicant\nasked her father\u2019s opinion on which employment offer she should accept. He did some research on\nthe companies and their employee benefits and advised her which offer she should accept.\nIn October 2005, she started working for her present employer doing systems integration\nwork on an unclassified air traffic control project.  Seeking a security clearance so that she can work\non a classified project for the U.S. military, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions (SF 86) on February 13, 2006. She disclosed her dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S.,\nthe U.S. residency but Taiwanese citizenship of her mother and brother, and the Taiwanese residency\nand citizenship of her father. She reported her sister\u2019s residency and citizenship as U.S.  Applicant\n16\nresponded \u201cYES\u201d to question 17D [\u201cLAST 7 YRS, ACTIVE PASSPORT ISSUED BY A FOREIGN\nGOVERNMENT?\u201d]. She indicated possession of a Taiwanese passport from an estimated February\n1983 (her date of birth) to February 2006 (present), and added that she had the passport by default\nbecause her parents are Taiwanese citizens. Applicant did not have her Taiwanese passport with her\nwhen she completed the SF 86 and decided to indicate that she had the passport for her entire life\nsince she did not know when it expired. In response to question 18 concerning any foreign countries\nvisited, Applicant listed pleasure trips to Taiwan from July 1997 to August 1997 [sic] and to\nIndonesia from July 2000 to August 2000.\n\n6\nApplicant has not visited her father in Taiwan since he was recalled there from Indonesia in\n2001. She sees him about once a year, most recently in January 2007 when he came to the U.S. to\nvisit his spouse and children over the New Year\u2019s holiday.\nApplicant has decided to make her permanent home in the U.S. where she has lived since she\nwas 11. Exposed to the cultural and social influences of the U.S., Applicant feels more American\nthan British. She still maintains contact with some elementary school friends in England, and visits\nthem from time to time, but she has stronger connections with her high school and college friends\nin the U.S. Applicant does not think of herself as a citizen of Taiwan and is willing to renounce\nTaiwanese citizenship. She does not know the island very well, has little recollection of her life there\nwhen she was a young child, and even though her father is there, he moves every few years for his\njob. Applicant has made no effort to renew her Taiwanese passport as she does not need it, and she\nhas no intent to renew it. She does not think that Taiwan recognizes her as a citizen since she has not\nbeen required to comply with laws imposed on Taiwanese citizens, and does not receive health\nbenefits, pay taxes, or have a national identity card from Taiwan. She does not belong to any\nTaiwanese cultural organizations in the U.S.\nApplicant and her mother jointly own the townhouse that her mother moved into in\nDecember 2005. Applicant pays the $2,500 monthly mortgage. Applicant currently resides in an\napartment near her work. Applicant has about $15,000 in savings in the U.S. She has no financial\nassets in Taiwan.\nAs of August 2007, Applicant\u2019s sister was living and working in the U.S. Her brother was\nin high school in the U.S. Both her siblings intend to remain permanently in the U.S. Applicant\nbelieves her brother intends to become a U.S. citizen. When Applicant\u2019s sister turned 21, she applied\nfor permanent residency in the U.S. for their mother. Applicant\u2019s mother is still awaiting her \u201cgreen\ncard.\u201d When Applicant or her sister inquires about the delay, they are told it is pending a background\ninvestigation.\n The Taiwanese government office employing Applicant\u2019s father covers domestic and\ninternational publicity, compilation, translation, audio-visual materials, mass media guidance and\nregulation, publication affairs, motion picture and broadcasting affairs, planning. Its main mission\nis to inform the public, both abroad and in Taiwan, of the government\u2019s policies, regulations, and\nactions, and to promote the development of the mass media (film, television, publishing). According\nto the office\u2019s website (Ex. A), the domestic information office releases news on major government\nadministrative policies; disseminates information domestically about government policies, laws, and\nregulations; collects and reflects public sentiments, handles public relations within the country for\nthe executive branch of the central government, and maintains \u201cconstant liaison\u2019 with the legislature.\nIts international department disseminates information about Taiwan internationally, gathers and\nresponds to international media reports, and maintains the department\u2019s foreign language websites.\nAs of August 2007, Applicant\u2019s father was working  in Taiwan. What Applicant knew of his\nduties is that he was working on a health referendum and on generating the press release notifying\nthe public domestically of a new law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets. (Tr. 32) Due to be\nstationed elsewhere, Applicant\u2019s father has requested to be assigned to the press division at the\nTECO in Applicant\u2019s locale in the U.S. where there is presently an opening. Applicant believes he\nintends to become a U.S. citizen when he retires. Her father turned 56 in early August 2007. He has\n\n7\nno plans to retire before her 16-year-old brother graduates from college. Applicant\u2019s father does not\nmanage any personnel in his office in Taiwan. Applicant corresponds with her father via electronic\nmail when there is an issue that needs to be discussed. She has kept him apprised of her mother\u2019s\ncondition since her mother had surgery in July 2007, and last emailed him in early August on his\nbirthday. He had considered coming to the U.S. for his spouse\u2019s operation but decided not to because\nof the flight costs. Applicant\u2019s father knows she is a systems engineer who writes\nrequirements/designs systems, but he has not asked her about specific projects.\nApplicant has extended family members (aunts, uncles, and cousins) who are resident\ncitizens of Taiwan. Applicant has visited with them when she was in Taiwan. She does not\ncorrespond with them because of the language barrier. They do not speak English. Applicant has\nlimited conversational knowledge of Chinese gained through listening to her parents converse with\neach other in their native language. Her parents spoke English to her when she was growing up.\nAdministrative notice was taken of the following adjudicative facts. The government of\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy. The United States recognizes that there is only one China, that\nthe government of the PRC is the sole legal government of China, and that Taiwan is part of China.\nNonetheless, under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial relations with\nTaiwan. Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to sell appropriate\nmilitary defensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most important\ntrading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose primary mission is the\ndefense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has not renounced\nthe use of force against Taiwan. It is U.S. policy that the resolutions of disputes between Taiwan and\nChina be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power and a member of the World Trade\nOrganization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the U.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The\nU.S. State Department reports that Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human\nrights and create a democratic political system since ending martial law. In the past, organizations\nin Taiwan employed unlawful methods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence information.\nTaiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As recently as\n2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S. State\nDepartment official. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue [her] security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n\n8\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, foreign influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or\nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). Applicant shares an understandably close bond to her father, who has\nbeen employed for at least the last 23 years by the office of the Taiwanese government whose\nprimary mission is to inform the public, both abroad and in Taiwan, of the government\u2019s policies,\nregulations, and actions, and to promote the development of the mass media (film, television,\npublishing) in Taiwan. Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion), applies.\nThe familial bond with her father is too strong to satisfy the first prong of mitigating\ncondition \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it\nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.).  Even though\nApplicant sees her father only about once or twice a year, she also corresponds with him by\nelectronic mail and sought his advice when she was offered several jobs on her graduation from\ncollege. The risk of Applicant  being placed in a position where she would have to choose between\nher father and the U.S. is diminished somewhat by the fact that Taiwan does not have a hostile\nrelationship with the U.S., and is not known to sponsor terrorism. Taiwan has made considerable\nprogress in achieving democratic elections, civil liberties, and stable, viable governmental\ninstitutions. As reported by the U.S. State Department, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve\nrespect for human rights and create a democratic political system since ending marital law in 1987.\nAlmost all restrictions on the press have ended, restrictions on personal freedoms have been relaxed,\nand the prohibition against organizing new political parties has been lifted. While the U.S. does not\nsupport independence for Taiwan and is committed to a one China policy, under the Taiwan\nRelations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself,\nincluding making available defensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. U.S. commercial ties\n\n9\nwith Taiwan have been maintained and expanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to jeopardize\nits relationship with the U.S. by overly pressuring its citizens.\nEven nations with a history of friendly relations, however, do not always have the same\ninterests. Taiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As\nrecently as 2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S.\nState Department official that bears troubling implications, although no proof of, active collection\nefforts by or on behalf of the Taiwanese government. Applicant\u2019s evidence fails to persuade that she\nis not at a heightened risk of undue foreign influence because of her father\u2019s employment with the\nTaiwanese government. Although his duties involve the open dissemination of information rather\nthan intelligence or security, he is required to promote the Taiwanese government\u2019s interests. What\nlittle is known about his job history suggests he is likely in a position of some responsibility and/or\nprominence in the public affairs office in Taiwan. He was stationed abroad in the U.S. and U.K.,\ncountries of significant international influence and power with whom Taiwan wants to maintain\nfavorable relations. He was in charge of the press office (albeit of only three persons) in Indonesia.\nHis duties bring him in daily contact with other Taiwanese government officials who could exert\ninfluence.\nSecurity concerns could be overcome by deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S. (see \u00b6 8(b) ( there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual\nhas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest)). A U.S. citizen from birth\nonly because her father happened to be stationed here at the time, Applicant did not begin to\nestablish ties to the U.S. until she moved here in about 1994 with her family. Yet she has spent the\nmost formative years of her still relative youth in the U.S. where she was influenced by her peers and\nAmerican culture as a student in public school and then at a private university. She elected to pursue\njob opportunities in the U.S. Since about December 2005, she co-owns with her mother the\ntownhouse her mother lives in. She testified credibly that she considers herself to be solely a citizen\nof the U.S. and she has strong relationships with her high school and college friends.\nBut her familial circumstances, albeit not within her control,  make it very difficult to predict\nwith confidence what she will do if faced with any undue foreign influence. While not alleged, she\nhas close bonds, both familial and economic (through co-ownership of the townhouse) with her\nmother, a Taiwanese citizen who does not enjoy the protections of U.S. citizenship or even\npermanent residency. Her application for permanent residency, filed for her by Applicant\u2019s sister in\nabout 2002, is still pending a background investigation. The family has made a significant sacrifice\nin her father\u2019s long separations from them for the sake of Applicant and her siblings\u2019 educations in\nthe U.S., but it is also clear that the Taiwanese government information office is aware of this\nsacrifice as well. The office partially covered the cost of Applicant\u2019s and her mother\u2019s trip to\nIndonesia to see Applicant\u2019s father in 2000, and they were given some credential to facilitate their\nentry that is not available to the general public in Taiwan. Should Applicant\u2019s father be transferred\nto the local press office at the TECO, he will have regular contact with other Taiwanese government\nemployees.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\n\n10\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). The government\u2019s concerns of foreign\npreference are based largely on dated or incorrect information such as the expiration date of the\nTaiwanese passport. Were it not for her parents\u2019 Taiwanese citizenship, Applicant would not be a\ncitizen of Taiwan (see \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country)). While her use of a Taiwanese passport in preference to her U.S. passport in 2000\nconstituted the active exercise of dual citizenship (see DC \u00b6 10(a) (exercise of any right, privilege,\nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship\nof a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport),\nshe was only 17 when she used the passport and acted on the advice of her mother, who thought it\nwould ease access if the border official was familiar with the language of the passport (i.e., Chinese\nas opposed to English). MC \u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor)\nis pertinent. Furthermore, she has not possessed a valid Taiwanese passport for some time. Her\nTaiwanese passport expired in November 2002 and it has been cancelled (Ex. B). She does not\nintend to renew it. Accordingly, concerns of unverifiable travel that require the destruction, surrender\nor invalidation of a foreign passport (see \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to\nthe cognizant security, or otherwise invalidated)) no longer exist.\nApplicant credibly testified to a preference for the U.S. She considers herself solely a U.S.\ncitizen and her ties to Taiwan are solely familial. Although she has traveled to Taiwan to see her\nfather and visited with extended family members while there, she is not that familiar with the island.\nShe has no assets there, has never paid taxes, voted, or performed military or other service for\nTaiwan. It is clear she has little sense of obligation or affinity to Taiwan. She left there before she\ndeveloped any appreciation for life in Taiwan, or any significant friendships. When stating her\npreference, she indicated she felt more American than British. Apparently the five or so years she\nspent in the U.K. as an elementary student had more impact on her than did her time in Taiwan. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a)).\nApplicant is a very well educated young professional who, along with her mother and siblings, has\nendured long absences from her father because of his work for the Taiwanese government. While\nshe has demonstrated a clear preference for the U.S., she is at heightened risk of exploitation,\npressure, or influence because of her close bonds to her parents whose lives have been dictated in\nsignificant part by the Taiwanese government for at least the past 23 years.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

The foreign preference concerns raised by his possession\nand use of an Algerian passport are mitigated by the surrender of his expired Algerian passport with\nno intent to renew it. Foreign influence concerns engendered by the Algerian citizenship and\nresidency of his father and seven of his nine siblings are overcome by Applicant\u2019s substantial ties\nto the U.S. developed over the past 20 years. Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 23, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nand Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered\nthe SOR on February 15, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was assigned to a DOHA administrative judge on May 9, 2007, and transferred to me on May\n15, 2007.\nOn June 21, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. One government exhibit (Ex.\n1) was admitted. Exhibit 2 was rejected on Applicant's objections as the document was largely\nillegible. Applicant's case consisted of 13 exhibits (A-M) and the testimonies of  a coworker and of\na neighbor in addition to his own. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received by DOHA on July\n6, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn April 20, 2007, the government requested that administrative notice be taken of several\nfacts concerning Algeria. The request was based on U.S. Government issuances and statements: from\nthe U.S. State Department,  Consular Information Sheet, Algeria, dated March 7, 2007,  Background\nNote: Algeria, dated February 2007, Travel Warning, Algeria, dated March 22, 2007, Country\nReports on Terrorism: Chapter 2 Middle East and North Africa Overview, dated April 30, 2007,\nCountry Reports on Terrorism: Chapter 5 Middle East and North Africa Overview, dated April 28,\n2006, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007, and U.S. Condemns\nTerrorist Attacks, April 11, 2007; from the Congressional Research Service Algeria: Current Issues,\ndated February 16, 2005; from the National Counterintelligence Executive a statement before the\nHouse Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security & Claims on September 15, 2005,\nand a report, The National Counterintelligence Strategy of the United States of America 2007; and\nfrom the Director of National Intelligence a statement before the Senate Armed Services Committee,\nAnnual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence, dated February 27, 2007.\nApplicant was granted until June 8, 2007, to file any objections and/or propose alternative facts for\nadministrative notice.\nOn June 7, 2007, Applicant's counsel submitted a response, including proposed factual\nfindings, argument in support of Applicant's clearance, and objections on the ground of relevance\nto considering the government's reports. Applicant submitted additional facts for administrative\n\nApplicant's response of June 7, 2007, was marked and admitted as Exhibit M.\n1\n4\nnotice concerning improvement in Algeria's stability and foreign relations should the government's\nrequest be granted.1\nAuthority to consider the requests is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and\nevidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner).  The DOHA\nAppeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader\nthan judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No. 02-24875 (decided Oct.\n12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative judge who took\nadministrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document was an official\nU.S. Government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was provided in advance\nto the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present alternative information.\nFacts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized\nsource and relevant and material to the case before me. After weighing the reliability of the source\ndocumentation, and assessing the relevance and materiality of the facts proposed by the parties, I\ntook administrative notice of certain facts concerning Algeria and Algeria\u2019s relationship with the\nU.S., as set forth below.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicant's father, two brothers, and five\nsisters, are resident citizens of Algeria (\u00b6 1.a) and that Applicant traveled to Algeria twice in 2002\n(\u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline C Applicant was alleged to exercise dual citizenship with Algeria and the\nU.S. (\u00b6 2.a), to have maintained an active Algerian passport until March 2003 after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen (\u00b6 2.b), and to have used his Algerian passport in preference to his U.S. passport to enter\nand/or exit Algeria since June 1990 (\u00b6 2.c).\nApplicant admitted the Algerian residency and citizenship of his family members and his\ntravel to Algeria, but denied he was susceptible to foreign influence because of these foreign ties.\nSimilarly, Applicant admitted his dual citizenship and that he had held an Algerian passport used to\ntravel to Algeria, but he contested the implication of a foreign preference.\nApplicant's admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough\nconsideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings with\nrespect to Applicant and also his Algerian ties.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old senior systems engineer who has worked for his current employer,\na defense contractor, most recently since February 2005. He was granted an interim secret clearance\nfor about a year and a half until it was withdrawn in December 2006. Applicant requires a clearance\nfor his duties in computer systems engineering.\nApplicant was born in Algeria in December 1957. The third of ten children, he left his\nparents and siblings behind in Algeria in 1977 when he came to the U.S. to pursue his undergraduate\n\n5\neducation. In December 1980, he completed his bachelor of science degree. He pursued graduate\nstudies in electrical and computer engineering at the same private university in the U.S., and earned\nhis doctorate in May 1989.\nAs an undergraduate, Applicant traveled to Algeria to see his family members about once a\nyear. Applicant did not go to Algeria as a graduate student as he understood he would have to serve\nin the Algerian military if he went to Algeria. Sometime in the late 1980s, Applicant was included\nin a general amnesty from fulfilling compulsory military service for Algeria.\nWhile in graduate school, Applicant met his future spouse, a native-born U.S. citizen. She\npersuaded him to remain permanently in the U.S.. They married in May 1986, and subsequently had\ntwo daughters, who were born in October 1989 and March 1992. \nIn March 1987, Applicant went to work as a senior research data analyst for a defense\ncontractor while continuing to work on and complete his thesis for his doctorate degree.  Applicant\nacquired his U.S. citizenship through naturalization in late June 1990. He vowed to renounce all\nforeign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or\nperform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant took\nno action to formally renounce his Algerian citizenship. He continued to retain an Algerian passport\neven though he was granted his U.S. passport shortly after his naturalization. A few months after he\nbecame a U.S. citizen, Applicant and his spouse purchased their current residence. They also traveled\nto Algeria in about August 1990. Applicant, his spouse, and infant daughter stayed with his parents\nwhile in Algeria.\nIn January 1992, Applicant was granted a secret-level security clearance for his duties\nsupporting U.S. Air Force missions  involving the study and mathematical modeling of atmospheric\nphenomena. Despite his growing expertise in near-space particle populations and interactions,\nApplicant elected to leave the job for a senior engineer II position with his present employer in\nMarch 1997. His secret clearance was transferred to his new employer for his duties on a ground\nradar project. In November 1998, Applicant traveled to Algeria on his Algerian passport, renewed\nin March 1998 for a five-year term by the Algerian Embassy. Applicant stayed with family members\nwhile in Algeria. Applicant did not report his foreign travel to the security office as he was told by\nhis supervisor that he only had to report business trips. Applicant was not actively accessing\nclassified information at that time since he was working on an unclassified air traffic control\nprogram. In November 2000, Applicant began employment with an electronic design automation\ncompany, and his security clearance was inactivated. He was laid off from that job in June 2002.\nApplicant traveled to Algeria in March 2002 to visit his ill mother. In August 2002, he\nreturned to Algeria, this time with his spouse and daughters, for his mother\u2019s memorial service on\nher death. On both trips in 2002, he entered and exited Algeria on his Algeria passport, which\nsubsequently expired in March 2003, even though he held a U.S. passport issued to him in late\nAugust 2001. Applicant saw no problem with using his Algerian passport since it had not been an\nissue with his previous clearance and so he did not attempt to get a visa so that he could travel on\nhis U.S. passport. Apart from routine border checks, Applicant did not have any contact with\nAlgerian government officials during his trips. Applicant used his U.S. passport when traveling to\nforeign countries other than Algeria.\n\nApplicant attested that he submitted in March 2005 an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing\n2\n(e-QIP) Investigation Request #382674 in order to reactivate his security clearance and as a result was issued an interim\nsecurity clearance; that due to either a computer glitch or the company\u2019s move from one facility to another, he submitted\nthe same form in spring 2006 (Ex. M). The only e-QIP in the hearing record is dated December 21, 2005 (Ex. 1). It is\nnot clear what information Applicant reported on the initial application, assuming one was submitted to his employer.\n6\nApplicant provided consultant services from January 2003 to about March 2005, when he\nthen returned to work for his current employer. He was granted an interim secret clearance for his\nduties. At his employer\u2019s request, Applicant completed a security clearance application (e-QIP) on\nDecember 21, 2005.  He disclosed his dual citizenship with the U.S. and Algeria since his U.S.\n2\nnaturalization in late June 1990, and his renewal of his Algerian passport to occasionally visit his\nfather. Applicant reported he had made two short trips to Canada in September/October 2004 to visit\nhis sister, an Algerian citizen, who had immigrated there from Algeria, and two brief visits to Algeria\nin 2002 to see his ill mother and then for her burial. Applicant also disclosed that en route home from\nAlgeria in April 2002, he had stopped in France for a few days to visit friends. Applicant indicated\non his clearance application that his father and seven of his nine siblings were resident citizens of\nAlgeria. He disclosed that one brother, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Algeria since his U.S.\nnaturalization in March 2004, was a U.S. resident.\nOn January 23, 2007, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging foreign preference\nconcerns raised by his dual citizenship with Algeria, and his possession and use of an Algerian\npassport after he had acquired U.S. citizenship, and foreign influence concerns because of the\nAlgeria citizenship and/or residency of his father and siblings and his travel to Algeria twice in 2002.\nOn February 15, 2007, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in the SOR while denying they raised\nsecurity disqualifying concerns of foreign preference or foreign influence. On April 13, 2007,\nApplicant turned in his expired passport to the Algerian Embassy, notifying them that he was\nrenouncing his citizenship. He requested some guarantee that he would be allowed to visit his family\nmembers in Algeria, and was notified that he and his family would be granted visas if they were to\ngo to Algeria in the future. Applicant requested written confirmation of his return of the passport and\nrenunciation of his Algerian citizenship. On April 27, 2007, an embassy official certified that\nApplicant had \u201creturned definitively\u201d to the Algerian Embassy his Algerian passport issued on\nMarch 30, 1998, and expired March 29, 2003.\nApplicant has never voted in an Algerian election. In addition to his home in the U.S., which\nis valued at about $550,000, he has monies on deposit in a credit union in the U.S. and a retirement\naccount. He has no foreign financial investments or assets. Applicant has been active in his\ncommunity as a player in an adult soccer league and as a coach and referee for youth soccer games.\nApplicant is held in high regard by his friends and neighbors. His next-door neighbor, a staff attorney\nwith the state\u2019s ethics commission, has met some of Applicant\u2019s family members from Algeria. He\nknows of no reason to question Applicant\u2019s ability or commitment to protect U.S. classified\ninformation.\nApplicant handled classified information appropriately in his work in ionospheric research\nin support of the Air Force from 1992 to 1997. His former employer has no reservations about\nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. and is of the opinion it would be a disservice to deny him a security\nclearance \u201cnot only to him, but also to present and future beneficiaries of [Applicant\u2019s] fully\ncommitted life and career in the United States\u201d (see Ex. G). Applicant continued his unblemished\n\n7\nrecord of handling classified information when he accessed secret-level information for his current\nemployer (see Ex. L). Several coworkers who have had the opportunity to work closely with him\nover the past two years attest to Applicant\u2019s vigilant attitude toward his security responsibilities, to\nhis contributions to the defense of the U.S., and to his trustworthiness (see Ex. H, I, J, K).\nAs of June 2007, Applicant\u2019s father and seven of his nine siblings (two brothers, five sisters)\nwere resident citizens of Algeria. At age 79 and retired, Applicant\u2019s father still owns his own truck\nin which he transports building materials used in the construction trade primarily for private\ncompanies. Since about 2000, he has been building a residence in Algeria. Applicant sent him\nbetween $2,000 and $3,000 in 2000 for the construction and $500 in 2005.  Applicant telephones\nhis father about once a month to inquire into his well-being. Applicant speaks to those of his siblings\nwho happen to be present when he calls his father. \nThe elder (age 47) of his brothers in Algeria is in charge of equipment maintenance for a\nprivate masonry firm. He and his spouse have three children, and his spouse is not employed outside\nthe home.  He used to work for a government-owned enterprise. Applicant\u2019s contact with this brother\nis about once every few months, when he happens to be at their father\u2019s house when Applicant\ntelephones. The younger brother (age 41) in Algeria is a self-employed repairman of electronics\nequipment. He is married with two children but still lives with Applicant\u2019s father. Applicant\u2019s\ncontact with him is limited to an occasional (every few months) hello. \nApplicant\u2019s two older sisters, ages 54 and 52, are housewives in Algeria. The elder sister\u2019s\nhusband operates his own auto body repair shop with their twenty-something-year-old son. The\nyounger has four children and is married to a car dealer. In part due to Applicant\u2019s advocacy on their\nbehalf, the four youngest of Applicant\u2019s sisters pursued higher education. One sister (age 43) is head\nveterinarian in an Algerian clinic and is  married to a civil engineer employed by a government-\nowned company that has not yet been privatized. They have three children. Another sister (age 35)\nis a radiologist in a government-funded hospital in Algeria. She had lived with their father before\nshe got this job and moved away within the last year to just north of the Saharan desert. Applicant\u2019s\nyoungest sister (age 32) has an ecology degree and works as a quality and health inspector in a\nprivate poultry laboratory. She still lives with Applicant\u2019s father, and Applicant speaks usually when\nhe calls his father\u2019s home. Applicant has not discussed his work with his family members in Algeria.\nApplicant gave his fourth eldest sister (age 39) $3,000 in about 2002 to emigrate to Canada.\nA current resident and citizen of Canada, she is married and has one child. Her husband recently\nearned his college degree and was working in a temporary job as of June 2007. Applicant visited this\nsister in Canada in 2004, and he telephones her once a month on average. The brother who is a U.S.\nresident citizen works as a custodian at a public middle school. He is married to a preschool teacher\nwho is also a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nAdministrative notice is taken of the following relevant facts pertinent to Algeria as verified\nby official U.S. Government publications. Algeria is a multiparty, constitutional republic that has\nbeen under a state of emergency since 1992 because of \u201cpersistent terrorism.\u201d Terrorist violence in\nthe country resulted in more than 100,000 deaths during the 1990s. In the years since the current\npresident of Algeria was first elected in April 1999, the security situation in Algeria has improved\n\nSee the U.S. State Department\u2019s Background Note: Algeria, dated February 2007.\n3\nSee the State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 5, dated April 28, 2006.\n4\nSee the State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2, dated April 30, 2007.\n5\nSee the State Department\u2019s Travel Warning, Algeria, dated March 22, 2007.\n6\nSee the Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence, dated February 27, 2007.\n7\nSee the State Department\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices-Algeria, dated March 6, 2007.\n8\nSee Background Note: Algeria, supra.\n9\n8\nmarkedly.  Terrorists (primarily the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat or GSPC) continued\n3\nto target civilians, security forces, and infrastructure by late 2005, although Algeria had made\nimpressive gains against terrorist groups operating in the country. With its base of support eroding\nin Algeria, the GSPC sought to align itself with al-Qaida and other extremist groups.  Algeria was\n4\nincluded among the countries in the Middle East and North Africa that the U.S. State Department\nconsidered had made impressive strides against terrorists in 2006. For the majority of 2006, the\nsecurity situation in Algeria remained remarkably unchanged, marked by stability in the major urban\nareas and low-level terrorist activities in the countryside. During the last quarter, there was an uptake\nin terrorist attacks after al-Qaida accorded the GSPC affiliate status, including one in December 2006\nwhere the GSPC ambushed expatriate workers of an American oil services company. According to\nthe U.S. State Department, the Algerian security services and military remained capable of handling\nthe prolonged effort against internal terrorist threats and continued to be a reliable ally of the U.S.\nin the War on Terror.  The recent terrorist attacks directed against foreigners in Algeria led the U.S.\n5\nState Department to issue a travel warning in March 2007 to apprise U.S. citizens of the significant\nsecurity risks from terrorism in many areas of Algeria.  Al-Qaida is the terrorist organization that\n6\npresents the greatest threat to U.S. interests.7\nHuman rights abuses (limited judicial independence, discrimination against women, torture,\narbitrary arrest and detention, restrictions on citizens\u2019 privacy rights, freedoms to assemble,\nassociate, practice religion without interference, travel, emigrate and repatriate) persisted in practice\nin Algeria, but the situation had improved in some areas from 2005. The government was generally\ncommitted to protecting the welfare, rights, health, and education of children.  The Algerian\n8\ngovernment espouses participatory democracy and free-market competition.9\nAlgerian diplomacy was instrumental in obtaining the release of U.S. hostages from Iran in\n1980. In July 2001, the current Algerian president became the first Algerian president to visit the\nWhite House since 1985. A second meeting in November 2001, and the Algerian president\u2019s\nparticipation at the June 2004 G8 summit held in the U.S., are seen by the U.S. State Department as\nindicative of the growing relationship between the U.S. and Algeria. Since the September 11 terrorist\nattacks, contacts in key areas of mutual concern, including law enforcement and counter-terrorism\ncooperation, have intensified between the two countries. Algeria publicly condemned the terrorist\nattacks on the U.S. and has been strongly supportive of the international war against terrorism. The\n\nId.\n10\n9\nU.S. and Algeria consult closely on key international and regional issues. Cooperation between the\nAlgerian and U.S. militaries continues to grow.10\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6\n6). It is undisputed that Applicant has foreign connections that present a potential risk of divided\nloyalties. Applicant\u2019s father and seven of his nine siblings are resident citizens of his native Algeria.\nThe salient issue is whether these foreign contacts present a heightened risk (see \u00b6 7(a) contact with\na foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen\nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion). The nature and strength of the family ties, the\ncountry involved, and the occupations, activities, and/or associations of the foreign family members\nare all relevant in assessing whether there is a heightened risk.\n\n10\nApplicant speaks with his father by telephone about once per month. He has contact with his\nsiblings only if they happen to be at his father\u2019s when he calls, except for his youngest sister who\nlives with their father. Applicant speaks with her usually when he calls the home. It is evident he\nfeels some affection or familial bond to them. Applicant fought for the education of his younger\nsisters (see Ex. F), has sent his father money, and has visited his family members in Algeria.\nApplicant clearly desires to maintain close relations with his family members in Algeria, as he\nsought assurances from the Algerian Embassy when he turned in his expired passport that he would\nbe granted a visa if he should want to travel to Algeria in the future. Yet the nature and extent of his\ncontact with his relatives in Algeria are what one might reasonably expect of any immigrant with a\nparent or siblings living in a distant country.\nAs to whether his family members\u2019 positions or activities create a heightened risk, there is\nnothing about any of his siblings\u2019 occupations that suggests any military, security, or intelligence\nresponsibilities.  In his character reference letter, Applicant\u2019s close friend indicated that Applicant\u2019s\nsister the veterinarian is a university faculty member (Ex. F), but Applicant described her position\nas a veterinarian in a private clinic. It is unclear whether she currently has any affiliation with a\npublic university in Algeria. Another sister works as a radiologist for a government-owned hospital.\nHer status as a well-educated female physician in a traditional culture may well raise her visibility,\nand she relies on the government for her pay. While Algerian and U.S. interests are not always\ncompatible, the two countries enjoy generally friendly relations. As reported by the U.S. State\nDepartment, contacts in key areas of mutual concern, including law enforcement and counter-\nterrorism cooperation, have intensified between the two countries since September 11, 2001. Algeria\npublicly condemned the terrorist attacks on the U.S. and has been strongly supportive of the\ninternational war against terrorism. The U.S. and Algeria consult closely on key international and\nregional issues.  Despite some concerns with the Algerian government restricting the exercise of\nsome basic human rights by its citizens, the Algerian government is not likely to attempt to gain\nimproper influence through Applicant\u2019s relatives (see \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with the\nforeign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.).\nAs for the risk of his relatives falling victim to terrorism by Algerian-based organizations\nsuch as the GSPC, which was recently accorded affiliate status by al-Qaida, such organizations are\nnot likely to be allowed to operate with impunity in Algeria. Algeria is not a state sponsor of\nterrorism. To the contrary, Algerian government interests were the primary target of the GSPC\u2019s\nterrorist activity. Significantly, Algeria has made impressive gains against terrorist groups operating\nin the country in the past two years. The GSPC has lost public support in Algeria. Despite the\nupsurge of GSPC activity in late 2006, the U.S. State Department still considers the Algerian security\nand military services as capable of handling the prolonged effort against internal terrorist threats.\nAlgeria is viewed as a reliable ally in the War on Terror. However, the risk of terrorism by rouge\nelements in Algeria was sufficiently high in March 2007 to warrant the State Department\u2019s travel\nwarning. Under the circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a) does not apply.\nNotwithstanding his bonds of affection and/or obligation to his father and siblings in Algeria,\nApplicant has persuaded me that he can be expected to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of\nthe U.S., where he has lived his entire adult life and established firm roots. In 1986, he married a\nU.S. native-born citizen. In 1990, he voluntarily acquired U.S. citizenship. Shortly thereafter, he and\n\nAs of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant\u2019s Algerian passport had expired.\n11\n11\nhis spouse purchased their current residence. They educated their two daughters, now ages 17 and\n15, in the local public schools. As evidenced by the character references submitted on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf (Ex. B, C, E, F), Applicant has strong, longstanding friendships in his community, developed\nover years of shared school and soccer events. He is also personally involved as a youth soccer\nreferee and as a participant in an adult soccer league.  Applicant has dedicated 15 years of his career\nto the U.S. defense effort. All of his financial assets are in the U.S. Apart from renewal and limited\nuse of his Algerian passport (see Guideline C), he has exercised the rights and enjoyed the benefits\nof U.S. citizenship. MC \u00b6 8(b), there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, applies.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). Applicant came to the U.S. at age 19,\nintending to return to his native Algeria after he completed his education. Yet in graduate school he\nbecame romantically involved with a U.S. native citizen. When faced with the choice of a future with\nher in the U.S. or his homeland, Applicant elected to remain in the U.S. He did not return to Algeria\nfor about ten years as he did not want to be conscripted to serve in the Algerian military, which\nindicates a preference for the U.S. However, after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen and acquiring\na U.S. passport, Applicant renewed his Algerian passport in March 1998 for another five years and\nused it to enter and exit Algeria in November 1998 and twice in 2002. Applicant did not intend the\nuse of the Algerian passport as an act in preference for Algeria. He testified he had heard anecdotally\nof others being denied access to a visa to enter Algeria, although he had never tried to obtain a visa\nto travel on his U.S. passport (Tr. 118-19). Irrespective of whether he used his Algerian passport\nbecause it had not been a problem in the past, he did not want to risk denial of a visa, or for\nconvenience, his voluntary renewal of his Algerian passport in March 1998 and use of that passport\nin 1998 and 2002 constitute the exercise of a privilege of Algerian citizenship as a U.S. citizen. Such\nconduct raises security significant foreign preference concerns under AG \u00b6 10 (a)(1), exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current\nforeign passport.11\n \nOn April 13, 2007, Applicant turned in his expired passport to the Algerian Embassy, and\nnotified officials that was renouncing his citizenship. Mitigating condition \u00b6 11(e), the passport has\nbeen destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated, applies.\nAny concerns that the DoD may have had of Applicant reapplying for that foreign passport have been\namply addressed by the letter of April 27, 2007, from the Algerian Embassy confirming that\nApplicant had \u201cdefinitively\u201d returned his passport. Applicant is not likely to reapply for an Algerian\npassport where he has gone to the trouble of turning it in and requesting confirmation of its\nsurrender. Notably absent from the Embassy\u2019s letter is any confirmation of Applicant\u2019s intent to\nrenounce his Algerian citizenship, or that return of the passport was alone enough to effect a\nrenunciation. Applicant testified he was led to understand that nothing more was required. Even if\n\n12\nhe remains an Algerian citizen, he has complied with DoD requirements. His surrender of his expired\nforeign passport is consistent with his U.S. citizenship and telling of a preference for the U.S.\nFurthermore, a credible willingness to renounce foreign citizenship is mitigating, even if no official\naction has been taken. MC \u00b6 11(b), the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship, applies.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a)).\nApplicant\u2019s voluntary exercise of Algerian citizenship after he had acquired U.S. citizenship would\nordinarily raise very serious concern about whether he can be counted on to serve U.S. interests (\u00b6\n2(a)(1), the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct). However, there is no indication that he\nunderstood that travel on his Algerian passport was inconsistent with his clearance and it was not\nintended as an act of foreign preference (\u00b6 2(a)(7), the motivation for the conduct), and he has\ndemonstrated reform in complying with DoD requirements to surrender, destroy, or otherwise\ninvalidate his Algerian passport (\u00b6 2(a)(6), the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes). He has significant ties to Algeria in the close bonds shared with his\nfather and seven siblings, but these are overwhelmed by his strong ties to the U.S. established since\nhe decided to make the U.S. his home in the mid-1980s (continuous residency, citizenship, financial\nassets, education, dedicated work for a defense contractor). He has shown he can be counted on to\nfulfill his fiduciary obligations to the United States, having handled classified information\nappropriately in the performance of his duties from 1992 to 2000 and from about March 2005 to\nDecember 2006.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor, was convicted of negligent\ndriving following an arrest for operating under the influence of liquor (OUIL) in September 2005.\nAlcohol consumption concerns are mitigated because of the isolated nature of the offense, the limited\nevidence of excessive drinking, and Applicant\u2019s intent to not drive on those rare occasions where\nhe drinks to excess. An operating after suspended license charge in 2002 is attributed to youthful\nirresponsibility that is countered by his stable employment in two jobs. However, personal conduct\nand criminal conduct concerns persist because he failed to list his then recent OUIL arrest on his\nsecurity clearance application, and because of his lengthy record of minor infractions. Clearance is\ndenied.    \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 26, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR\nwas issued. Applicant answered the SOR on March 9, 2007, and elected a decision based on the\nwritten record  without a hearing.\nOn April 20, 2007, the government requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge,\nand the case was assigned to me on June 14, 2007. Pursuant to notice dated July 5, 2007, I convened\na hearing on August 20, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. At the hearing,  two government exhibits\n(Exs. 1- 2) and 12 Applicant exhibits (Exs. A-L) were admitted, and testimony was taken from\nApplicant. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on August 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G that Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and\nintoxication from about 1998 to at least September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and was arrested for operating\nunder the influence of liquor (OUIL) in September 2005 but convicted of negligent driving (\u00b6 1.b).\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his February 2006 security clearance\napplication by denying that he had ever been charged with any offense related to alcohol or drugs\n(\u00b6 2.a). The OUIL (\u00b6 3.c), an October 2002 operating after license suspension charge (\u00b6 3.b), and a\nfelony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (\u00b6 3.a) for denying any alcohol charges when he completed his\nclearance application, were alleged under Guideline J.\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the OUIL arrest but denied that he had consumed alcohol\nat times to intoxication from 1998 to September 2006, since he was not of legal age to drink until\n\nApplicant explained that he had not noticed or received a renewal notice that his license had expired. (Tr. 86-\n1\n87) His driving record indicates that his license had been suspended on March 5, 2002 (\u201cSUSPENSION PAYMENT\nDEFAULT INDEFINITE\u201d). He had been stopped for speeding on July 12, 2001, and November 26, 2001, and for a seat\nbelt violation on December 19, 2001 (Ex. J), although it is not clear whether these violations led to his license\nsuspension. Applicant denies that speeding was the cause of the license suspension. (Tr. 102)\n3\nAugust 2002 and did not consume alcohol \"at times to excess and to the point of intoxication.\"\nApplicant acknowledged he had responded \"No\" on his clearance application to whether he had ever\nbeen charged or convicted of any drug or alcohol offense. He denied any intent to falsify, however,\nand indicated he had misunderstood the question. Applicant admitted he had been charged with\nOUIL and operating after suspended license, and corrected the date of the latter to March 2002 as\nreflected in the state's records. He admitted the alleged violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 while at the\nsame time maintaining he did not intend to falsify information. Questioned about this seemingly\ninconsistent position at the hearing, Applicant reiterated that he did not deliberately lie on his\nclearance application.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old supply chain specialist employed by a defense contractor as a\ndirect hire since February 2006. He had worked at the company as a summer intern from May 2005\nand his internship was extended until he was hired as a full-time employee. Applicant held a\nconfidential security clearance until it was withdrawn in December 2006. He seeks reinstatement of\nhis security clearance so that he can access the production floor. Since he lost his clearance,\nApplicant had been managing 45 labor relations personnel and handling the paperwork (batching of\nkits and assemblies) for the product line to run on the production floor.\nWhile in high school, Applicant worked part-time for a restaurant as a bus boy starting in\nFebruary 1998.  He took his first drink of alcohol at age 16 from his father\u2019s beer, but focused on his\nschoolwork, and  he earned his diploma in June 2000.\nIn August 2000, he began working at night as a mechanic for the ambulance company where\nhis father is employed. Applicant had been cleaning ambulances for the company since he was 14.\nHe continued to work for the ambulance company and for the restaurant while pursuing his college\ndegree from September 2000 to May 2004. Applicant drank alcohol once or twice every two or three\nmonths at social gatherings, largely due to peer pressure. He did not drink to get drunk. During his\njunior year, he studied abroad for one semester, from February 2003 to July 2003. Applicant\nconsumed alcohol to intoxication only once when he was there, and he did not operate a vehicle.\nApplicant has a record of motor vehicle violations, from a failure to stop in April 1999 to\nspeeding in May 2006. En route to his job at the ambulance company, Applicant was stopped for\nspeeding on or about March 21, 2002. He was let go with a warning, but after a check of his license\nrevealed it was suspended,  the police came to the ambulance company. He was told that if he paid\n1\nthe reinstatement fee at that time, he would be all set. Applicant paid the fee (see Ex. J), but in\nOctober 2002, he was charged with operating a motor vehicle with license suspended in March 2002.\nOn December 19, 2002, the speeding charge was filed and the license suspension charge was ordered\n\n4\ndismissed on payment of $200 court costs. Applicant paid the court costs on March 26, 2003, and\nthe charge was dismissed.\nIn May 2004, Applicant was awarded his bachelor of science degree in psychology. He\nreturned home to live with his mother, and he continued to work as a mechanic for the ambulance\ncompany and as a waiter at the restaurant. In April 2005, he left the employ of the restaurant because\nhe wanted more of a social life. In May 2005, he landed a postgraduate internship as a contracts aid\nwith his current employer. Applicant proved to be reliable, trustworthy, enthusiastic, and self-\nassured, and to possess good communication and analytical skills. His internship was extended in\nSeptember 2005 because of the quality of his work.\nIn early September 2005, Applicant got together with his best friend, who had just come back\nfrom Iraq after about one year in theater. They went to another friend\u2019s home where Applicant\nconsumed one or two beers. The three then went to a bar where Applicant drank three or four beers\nover 2 1/2 to 3 hours. En route home after dropping off his best friend, Applicant took his attention\noff his driving as he reached around in the back seat. He struck a tree, and the impact propelled his\nvehicle into two parked cars. Applicant was arrested at the scene and charged with OUIL and failure\nto stay in marked lanes. He refused to submit to field sobriety tests as he had heard it would be best\nto do so, knowing that his driver\u2019s license would be suspended for 180 days. Applicant pleaded not\nguilty to OUIL as he felt he was not intoxicated (\u201cI can\u2019t say to be honest with you, I mean I\u2019m sure\nalcohol played a minor role, but it wasn\u2019t, I mean I think that anyone knows when they have a couple\nof drinks, they get behind the wheel, they know if they can drive or not.\u201d Tr. 72). On November 23,\n2005, the marked lanes violation was ordered dismissed on payment of $100 costs. Applicant\npleaded guilty to a charge of negligent operation of a motor vehicle and the case was continued\nwithout a finding for two years on completion of two years probation, completion of a \u201cBrains at\nRisk\u201d course, attending an eight-hour highway safety program, and payment of a $500 fine.\nApplicant was timely in his probation payments and met with his probation officer once monthly or\nas prearranged if their schedules conflicted. His mother drove him to and from work while his\noperator\u2019s license was suspended.\nIn February 2006, Applicant became a direct employee of the defense contractor. Needing\na clearance to access the production floor for his duties as a supply chain specialist in the circuit card\nassembly area, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) on February 21,\n2006. He responded \u201cNO\u201d to police record inquiries, including questions 23 D, \u201cALCOHOL/DRUG\nCHARGE?\u201d and 23 F \u201cLAST 7 YRS, ADDITIONAL CHARGES?\u201d. Since his OUIL charge had\nbeen reduced to negligent operation, Applicant did not consider it as relevant to his clearance so he\ndid not disclose it. He now understands that he made a mistake and should have reported it (\u201cI made\na mistake, I overlooked them and I didn\u2019t think it would have a bearing on whether or not I got a\nclearance from [company name omitted] and, as time went on and here we are, where we are right\nnow, today, I can see that it has.\u201d Tr. 92).\nApplicant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was reinstated in March 17, 2006. In May 2006, he was again\nstopped for speeding, but there is no evidence that alcohol was involved. About once a year since\nhe turned 21, Applicant drank to the point where he considered himself intoxicated, after consuming\nabout 12 beers over the course of a holiday or family gathering. The last time he drank that much was\naround Thanksgiving 2006 at a high school reunion and while at a friend\u2019s home afterwards.\nApplicant did not operate a vehicle that evening. Applicant split a six-pack with a friend while\n\n5\nplaying golf in July 2007. He had not consumed any alcohol in about a month as of his security\nclearance hearing. Applicant does not consider himself to have a problem with alcohol. He has never\nbeen told that he has a problem. He does not intend to repeat any of the conduct that led to the\nissuance of the SOR.\nApplicant continues to maintain his part-time job as a night mechanic for the ambulance\ncompany. After putting in a full day for the defense contractor, he works evenings repairing\nambulances. He has been on time for his scheduled shifts and is well liked by his coworkers.\nApplicant has also continued to exhibit enthusiasm and reliability in his work for the defense\ncontractor, maintaining a positive attitude despite being unable to fulfill all aspects of his job since\nhis clearance was withdrawn. He is well regarded by his supervisors (\u201ca top-notch team player,\u201d see\nEx. E). In addition to his paid jobs, Applicant has volunteered in the community, cleaning up the\ngrounds of a church and serving food at a transitional living center in the area.\nAs of July 2007, Applicant had applied for a five-month work order scheduler position with\nhis employer\u2019s vehicle maintenance facility in a remote location. He has been notified of his\nselection for the duty assignment scheduled to commence in October 2007 provided he fulfills\ncertain requirements. On August 29, 2007, Applicant plans to petition for early dismissal of his\nprobation on the negligent driving charge so that he can pursue the temporary job opportunity.\nWhile at the remote site, he plans to apply for a position with his current employer at one of its\nfacilities in the country where he had spent a semester abroad. When his mother first heard he\nwanted the position at the remote location, she told him that she did not want him to pursue it if he\nwas going there to drink rather than to further his career. Applicant, who has been working out at a\ngym four to five times a week, intends to work nine-hour days six days per week at the remote site\nand to go to the gym there after work. \nAs of August 2007, Applicant was living  with his mother, who purchased a condominium\nafter her divorce from Applicant\u2019s father in 2002. Applicant\u2019s sister and her  seven-year-old son have\nalso been living there since November 2004. Applicant pays room and board at $50 weekly as well\nas the telephone/Internet/cable bill.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\n\n6\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline G\u2014Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant\u2019s arrest for OUIL in September 2005 is potentially\ndisqualifying under \u00b6 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nAlthough Applicant was convicted of negligent operation, he exhibited sufficient signs of alcohol\nimpairment for the arresting officer to ask him to submit to field sobriety tests. DC \u00b6 22(a) applies.\nApplicant continues to downplay the role alcohol played in the September 2005 incident (\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t intoxicated, I just lost control of my vehicle, it happened. . . . I mean I\u2019m sure alcohol played\na minor role . . .  I wouldn\u2019t put myself in a situation where I couldn\u2019t operate a vehicle. . . .\u201d Tr. 71-\n72), but he admits he drank to intoxication once when he was studying abroad, and about once yearly\nsince turning 21, after consuming about 12 beers at gatherings of friends and/or family. While the\nquantity would tend to indicate binge drinking, absent evidence of the time over which this amount\nwas consumed, I cannot conclude that disqualifying condition \u00b6 22(c), habitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, applies. The last time he drank 12 beers was\nover the course of an entire evening, at a high school reunion and afterwards at a friend\u2019s house, in\nNovember 2006.Whether or not 12 beers qualifies as binge drinking (which is not defined in the\nDirective), Applicant exercised questionable judgment in drinking to an irresponsible level.\nYet his drinking to abusive levels has been so infrequent as to fall within mitigating condition\n(MC) \u00b6 23(a), so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The government presented no evidence to\nshow that Applicant has an alcohol problem, or that he consumed alcohol to excess even\noccasionally since 1998. Evidence of driving under the influence is limited to a single occasion in\nSeptember 2005, when Applicant, who had turned 23 only the month before, was out celebrating the\nsafe return of his best friend from Iraq. His consumption of alcohol at family gatherings over the\nholidays is likely to continue, but occasions of excessive drinking are rare, and he did not operate\na vehicle after drinking to excess. While he continues to maintain that he was not intoxicated on the\noccasion of his accident in September 2005, he recognizes that alcohol probably played a role that\nday, and that he made a mistake that he is resolved to not repeat. Given his maturation in the past\ntwo years, as evidenced by his dedication to two employers, he is not likely to allow alcohol to\nnegatively impact his judgment and reliability in the future.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\n\n8\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant did not list his recent OUIL arrest\non his February 2006 security clearance application, either in response to question\n23D\u2013\u201cALCOHOL/DRUG CHARGE?\u201d or 23F\u2013\u201cLAST 7 YRS, ADDITIONAL CHARGES?\u201d. The\ngovernment alleged under Guideline E SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified a more detailed question\nthan that in evidence, but it is clear that Applicant understood that 23D, even in its abbreviated form,\npertained to any alcohol charges, and that he had been recently arrested in September 2005 for OUIL.\nApplicant has consistently denied any intentional concealment. When he answered the SOR,\nApplicant indicated that he \u201cmisunderstood the question being asked in the e-QIP,\u201d and he responded\naccurately and to the best of his knowledge. He did not elaborate as to the nature of his\nmisunderstanding. At his hearing, he testified with regard to his intent:\nWell, with regards to filling this out, I mean I had gone through, I didn\u2019t think that\nit would have a bearing on my clearance, you know. At the time, I felt that it was just\nbecause I was charged or, rather, convicted of negligent driving, that I didn\u2019t feel it\nwas alcohol or drug related because it was negligent driving, though I was charged\nwith operating under the influence. (Tr. 77)\nIn other words, since the charge had been reduced, Applicant did not consider it an alcohol-related\noffense. Applicant\u2019s explanation for not listing the charge in response to question 23D is plausible,\ngiven he was convicted of negligent operation before he completed his SF 86. However, since he was\non probation for negligent driving at the time, he bears a heavy burden to overcome the negative\ninference for his credibility that arises from his failure to list then the negligent driving conviction\nin response to question 23F.\nAt his hearing, the government asked Applicant about an interview with a government\ninvestigator during which Applicant was asked about his failure to disclose the September 2005\ncharge on his security clearance application. While Applicant acknowledged the interview, he\nindicated he did not recall telling the agent that he did not disclose the charge because he \u201cthought\nit was a personal matter.\u201d (Tr. 73) The government failed to prove that Applicant made such a\nstatement to the investigator. However, Applicant still has the burden to persuade that his omission\nof the charge from his security clearance application was not intentional, and he failed to do so. He\ntestified that he was constantly checking with the registry of motor vehicles to see if he could drive\n(Tr. 67) and he had to report to his probation officer, so the incident was fresh in his mind as of\nFebruary 2006.  Rather, the more plausible explanation for the omission is that Applicant just wanted\nto put the incident behind him and get on with his life, and he did not want it to hinder his chances\nat getting  a clearance (\u201cWell, with regards to filling this out, I mean I had gone through, I didn\u2019t\nthink that it would have a bearing on my clearance.\u201d Tr. 76). Disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(a),\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies.\nThe government must be assured that those persons granted access can be counted on to place\ntheir fiduciary obligations ahead of their personal interests. Applicant testified that he was candid\nwhen he met with the investigator about the September 2005 arrest for OUIL (\u201cthe gentleman that\nwas investigating me, I answered his questions honestly and forthright,\u201d Tr. 77).  This supports an\ninference that Applicant was frank in response to the agent\u2019s questions, but it is not enough to satisfy\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n2\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowing and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact: (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n9\nmitigating condition \u00b6 17(a), the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. Absent evidence as to when the\ninterview took place, it cannot be determined whether the correction was prompt. Furthermore,\nApplicant\u2019s testimony suggests that he did not volunteer the information up-front. Applicant can\navail himself of the benefit of none of the mitigating conditions where is unwilling to acknowledge\nthat he intentionally did not include the charge on his security clearance application.\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant stands convicted of negligent operation of a motor vehicle for\nan alcohol-related offense committed in September 2005, and of operating a vehicle while his license\nwas suspended in March 2002. DC \u00b6 31(a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\napplies, even if the suspension charge was due to his failure to note that his license had expired\nrather than to knowing violation of the laws against operating without a license. Since his\nfalsification of his security clearance application in February 2006 is punishable as a felony offense\nunder 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001,  DC  \u00b6 31(c), allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\n2\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, is also implicated.\nMoreover, DC \u00b6 31(d), individual is currently on parole or probation, must be considered because\nApplicant has not yet completed his  probation for the September 2005 negligent driving.\nApplicant\u2019s 2006 felonious false statement on his SF 86 and his September 2005 negligent\ndriving are too recent to favorably consider MC \u00b6 32(a), so much times has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that is it unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His\nlack of candor on his security clearance application, committed while on probation for another\noffense, raises serious doubts  about his judgment and reliability. Applicant has shown some reform,\nin that he is remorseful for the September 2005 incident, is held in high regard by his two employers,\nand has provided volunteer service to his church and to a local transitional living center. He has only\na few months left in his probation, and he may even be discharged early at his request so that he can\npursue the job at the remote location (See MC \u00b6 32(d), there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement). However, doubts persist about Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation as he yet to demonstrate that\nhis representations can be relied on.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n10\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. Applicant argues in his favor that he is not the person that he was when he\ncommitted the criminal acts alleged in the SOR. Immaturity and changed circumstances are relevant\nfactors that must be considered in reaching a determination (\u00b6 2(a)(4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct, \u00b6 2(a)(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes). At work, Applicant has shown reliability and dedication for two\ndifferent employers that reflect a maturity beyond his years. Yet, that same level of maturity has not\nbeen consistent when it comes to his off-duty behavior. In choosing to drive after drinking four to\nsix beers, Applicant placed himself and others at risk. While it was not alleged by the government,\nhe has a record of speeding, including a May 2006 offense within a couple of months of regaining\nhis license. Concerns that he may place his personal interest ahead of his fiduciary obligations\npreclude me from finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

(Item 5)\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance. On February 8, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR),  which specified the basis for its decision \u2013  security concerns addressed in the Directive\n1\nunder Guideline F (financial considerations). On March 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR,\nadmitted to all of the allegations therein, and requested a determination without a hearing.\nOn March 21, 2007, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials\n(FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision, a copy of which Applicant received\n2\non March 28, 2007. Applicant was afforded 30 days in which to file a response to the FORM, but\nhe submitted nothing before the deadline. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged through the SOR that Applicant declared bankruptcy in 2001 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a), and that he owes $119,573 for 11 delinquent credit card accounts, most of which were\nreferred for collection between August 2000 and August 2002 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.l). In response,\nApplicant admitted each of the SOR allegations and acknowledged he has not paid or otherwise\nresolved any of the listed debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old mechanical engineer employed since May 2004 by a defense\ncontractor. His position requires him to have a security clearance.  To that end, he submitted an\n3\nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) form to initiate a background\ninvestigation to determine his suitability to have access to classified information. In that form, he\ndisclosed the debts listed in the SOR. He also disclosed he had filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition\nin 2001. (Item 4) \nThe ensuing background investigation confirmed through credit checks the debts listed in his\ne-QIP. (Items 6 and 7)  Investigators also obtained the records of his April 11, 2001, Chapter 7\n4\nbankruptcy petition showing he declared $367,753 in liabilities against assets totaling $337,240. On\nAugust 6, 2001, after a hearing on motion of the Trustee, the petition was dismissed. No reason was\nstated for the motion; however, there is no indication Applicant was discharged of any of his debts.\n(Item 8)\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; see also Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n The Adjudicative Guidelines in Directive, Enclosure 2 have been superceded by the Revised Adjudicative\n8\nGuidelines, approved by the President on December 29, 2005,and implemented by the Department of Defense on\nSeptember 1, 2006. Pending formal revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the\nguidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in\nwhich an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative\n9\ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Eligibility for access to classified information is  predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a\nnumber of variables known as the whole-person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and\n4\nApplicant accrued his credit card debts between 1999 and 2001 by using cash advances from\nthose accounts to invest in the stock market. To further complicate things, he invested on margin,\nmeaning that he used funds borrowed from a broker to make his investments. His loans were called\nin when his stocks fell, but he did not have the money to pay them. He continued to get cash\nadvances from his credit cards to pay his margin calls, but he could not keep up with the required\npayments. After his bankruptcy petition failed in August 2001, his attorney advised him to \u201cdo\nnothing\u201d to resolve his delinquencies. With his credit card debts still outstanding, he has recently\nbegun rebuilding his credit through two new credit card accounts.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n5\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor an applicant to have access to classified information. The applicant must then present sufficient\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a\nsecurity clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion to comply with the government\u2019s\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own.  The \u201cclearly\n6\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  for consideration when evaluating an\n8\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance decisions must reflect\nconsideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under each adjudicative guideline as\nmay be applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines, \u00b6 2(a).  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\n9\n\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an\nindividual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors: (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, Section 18.\n10\n (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending\n11\nand the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt; (c)\na history of not meeting financial obligations; \n5\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the pleadings\nand the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here\nis Guideline F (financial considerations).\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Based on the facts presented in this case, the security concern\nabout Applicant\u2019s finances, as expressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, is that \u201c[f]ailure\nor inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d  Here, through a poorly conceived, high-risk approach to stock market\n10\ninvestment, Applicant accrued more than $119,000 in delinquent credit card debt between 1999 and\n2001. The only corrective action he has taken was to file for bankruptcy protection, but that failed\nand he has done nothing further to resolve his delinquencies. Under this guideline and on these facts,\ndisqualifying conditions 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c)  apply. \n11\nIn response to the government\u2019s concerns, Applicant has not presented any information that\nwould support application of any of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. His explanation that he\nwas simply following his attorney\u2019s advice when he decided not to repay his debts is insufficient.\nAs a matter of credit reporting, such advice may be sound; however, the government\u2019s interest is not\nin Applicant\u2019s credit rating. Rather, the government looks to Applicant\u2019s willingness to fulfill his\nresponsibilities and manage his personal affairs so that he will not be at risk of undue influence or\ncoercion that may result in compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s debt arose from poor\njudgment and his willingness to ignore his past due debts is directly at odds with the government\u2019s\nconcerns in this regard. I conclude this guideline against the Applicant.\nWhole Person. Having assessed the facts presented in this record and applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline F, I turn now to a review of the record before me\n\n See footnote 9, supra.\n12\n Required by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(c).\n13\n6\nin the context of the whole person factors listed in Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a).12\nApplicant is 42 years old and, by virtue of his education and professional experience, a mature,\nintelligent adult. However, for the past six years, he has been unwilling to address the significant\nfinancial obligations brought about by his deliberately risky behavior. The financial aspects of his\nbackground continue to put him at risk of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. It is unlikely\nthese conditions will change in the future. \nA fair and commonsense assessment  of the entire record before me shows the government\u2019s\n13\ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to classified information are based on reliable\ninformation about his finances. In response, Applicant has failed to carry his burden of producing\ninformation sufficient to resolve those doubts. Accordingly, available information shows it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified\ninformation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for the Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nMatthew E. Malone\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 30, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on April 30, 2007, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on May 31, 2007. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded\nan opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on June 7, 2007, and responded on July 1,\n2007. Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s response. The case was assigned to me on\nAugust 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married, and has an adult\nchild from a previous marriage. Applicant served in the United States Air Force from 1967 to 1971,\nand received an Honorable Discharge. He is a college graduate. Applicant has held a security\nclearance since 1967.  \n2\nApplicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and had his debts discharged on three separate\noccasions. His debts were discharged on February 13, 1991, July 28, 1997, and May 4, 2005.3\nApplicant attributed his first bankruptcy to financial issues incident to an acrimonious\ndivorce. Applicant separated from his then spouse in April 1990. Applicant was paying support to\nhis wife, and had the additional expense of maintaining a separate residence. Applicant\u2019s expenses\nexceeded his salary, and he began using credit to make up the difference. In August 1990, Applicant\nwas ordered to pay $600 per month in alimony, and $500 to their monthly mortgage payment, until\nthe house was sold. His wife informed him that she would take about a year to pull herself together,\nand work on the house to ready it for sale before listing it with a realtor. Applicant foresaw 18\nmonths to two years before his wife would vacate the house. Applicant\u2019s divorce was final on\nSeptember 21, 1990. He married his current spouse on September 26, 1990.  \n4\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n5\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n6\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM, Appendix 2; Item 1 at 6; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 4.\n7\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n8\n4\nApplicant stated he filed bankruptcy in November 1990, as a means of forcing the sale of the\nhome, and to free him of his own significant credit obligations, as well as the several joint accounts\nhis former wife opened in his name without his knowledge. The house was sold in December 1990.\nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged on February 13, 1991.   \n5\nIn June 1991, as a result of down-sizing at his company, Applicant was laid off his job after\nten years with the company. Applicant found a lesser paying job, with fewer benefits. Applicant\u2019s\nwife ran a business out of their rented home between 1992 and 1993. Applicant had a dispute with\nthe landlord over the conditions of the house. Applicant stated his wife\u2019s health suffered as a result\nof the conditions, which prevented her from carrying out her business plans. Applicant negotiated\na release from the remainder of his two-year lease, in return his landlord would keep their $700\nsecurity deposit and their last month\u2019s rent. Applicant and his wife moved much of their belongings\nout of the house, but planned on returning in a few days to clean the house and remove the rest of\ntheir belongings. Applicant stated when they returned, the landlord had removed their belongings,\nmuch of which was lost to the trash pick-up. Included were their tax documents for 1991 to 1993.6\nApplicant and his wife were audited by the IRS. Applicant stated the auditor refused to allow\ntheir business deductions because the documentation of their expenses was lost when they moved.\nA tax lien of $11,592 was filed in August 1996. After several years of negotiation with the IRS,\nApplicant and his wife entered into an agreement to pay $350 per month. Applicant and his wife\nfiled for bankruptcy on April 21, 1997. An IRS statement dated May 7, 1997, shows a payment of\n$350, and a total liability for tax years 1992 and 1993, including penalties and interest, of $18,799.\nA letter dated June 13, 1997, from the United States Attorney for Applicant\u2019s jurisdiction stated that\nApplicant and his wife\u2019s federal taxes for 1992 and 1993, were dischargeable in bankruptcy.\nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged on July 28, 1997.7\nApplicant and his wife cared for and supported her partially disabled brother and\ngrandmother on several occasions. Her grandmother last lived with them from October 1998, until\nher death in late December 1998.8\nApplicant had surgery in February 1999. He and his wife lived on disability pay of $451 per\nweek for nine weeks while he recovered. Applicant had a different surgery in April 2002. He was\non disability of $461 per week for five weeks. Applicant had several medical issues in the early part\nof 2004, which caused him to use his accrued sick leave and vacation time. Applicant had a heart\nattack in June 2004, by which time he had already used up all his sick leave and vacation time. He\nwas off work and on disability of $461 per week for about eight weeks. He also incurred medical\nbills relating to his illnesses.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n13\nId. at 527.\n14\n5\nfrom working. Applicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy on December 17, 2004. Their debts were\ndischarged on May 4, 2005.9\nApplicant was delinquent in his mortgage payments from August 2004 through September\n2005. After being delinquent for a period, Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney advised them not to make\nany additional mortgage payments, and to let their house go to foreclosure. Applicant decided that\nwas an unacceptable option, and began working with the mortgage company in October 2005, to\nbring the mortgage current. He started putting an extra $700 per month in escrow. In February 2006,\nApplicant reached an agreement with the mortgage company. Applicant paid $3,700 to establish a\nhardship program. All back mortgage payments, taxes, and interest were added to the principal of\nthe mortgage, and the $3,700 was used to pay the mortgage company for their costs incurred by their\nforeclosure actions.  \n10\nSince his debts were discharged in May 2005, Applicant\u2019s finances have stabilized. After\nentering the agreement with the mortgage company, Applicant\u2019s mortgage payments have been made\non time every month. With the amounts added to the mortgage principal, the balance owed on the\nmortgage was $87,960 in March 2007. The assessed value of his property was $114,130, so\nApplicant has equity in his home. A review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports from December 5, 2006,\nFebruary 8, 2007, and March 14, 2007, reveals his up-to-date mortgage, and only one credit card\ndebt, with a balance of $136. His wife had three credit cards with a total balance of $1,860, and\nminimum monthly payments totaling $45. He and his wife own two American made compact cars,\na 1994 sedan, and a 1998 wagon. The car loans on both cars are paid. Applicant had $24,848 in his\n401(k) on December 31, 2006. He had $1,134 in the bank on February 28, 2007.   \n11\nApplicant discussed an intention to obtain credit counseling when he submitted his security\nclearance application in December 2004, but did not submit additional evidence that he ever actually\nreceived counseling. A character letter describes Applicant as honest, reliable, and trustworthy.  \n12\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n13\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n14\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\n\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n15\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n16\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n17\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n18\n6\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n15\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n16\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n17\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n18\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts, resulting in three bankruptcies, establishes Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors\n19\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\nSee ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FC MC 6 for\n20\ndebts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant had three bankruptcies, and only resolved his mortgage problems in February 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from an acrimonious divorce, his layoff from a ten-year job,\nhis tax issues from 1992 and 1993, and both his and his wife\u2019s numerous medical problems.\nApplicant states his tax problems resulted from the loss of paperwork to document his wife\u2019s\nbusiness expenses. I do not find that constitutes a condition that was largely beyond his control. I do\nfind the other factors were largely beyond his control. I further find that under the circumstances, the\nutilization of bankruptcy, a legally available option, was a responsible means of addressing those\ndebts that arose from conditions that were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I find that FC MC\n20(a) is partially applicable because Applicant\u2019s behavior occurred under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. FC MC 20(b) is applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, and partially applicable to SOR\n\u00b6 1.b.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant followed up on his stated intention to receive counseling.\nTherefore, the first part of FC MC 20(c) has not been established. Unlike the previous version, this\nmitigating condition under the revised AG, contains the language, \u201cand/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Applicant has resolved his mortgage issues.\nHe and his wife have accrued a minimal amount of new debt since the bankruptcy. They own two\nolder, paid-off compact cars. He has money in the bank, a 401(k), and equity in his house. I find\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been resolved and are under control. The second part of FC MC\n20(c) has been established. \nFC MC 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to establish that\nApplicant showed good faith in the resolution of his debts.  He does however merit partial credit\n19\nfor using bankruptcy, which is a legal means for resolving his debts.  Bankruptcy substantially\n20\n\nFORM at 5.\n21\n8\nreduced his debts, and accordingly reduced his potential vulnerability to improper financial\ninducements.        \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nA series of unfortunate events led to Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and ultimately to his\nfiling three bankruptcies. While I do not find that his tax debt was beyond his control, the liability\nfor that debt arose in 1992 and 1993, fifteen and fourteen years ago, and there is no evidence of\nrecurrence of tax issues. Applicant used a legally available option to address his debts. As stated\nabove, bankruptcy eliminated Applicant\u2019s debts, and accordingly reduced his potential vulnerability\nto improper financial inducements. Applicant is now in financially sound shape. He has assets and\nminimal liabilities.\nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s three bankruptcies since 1990, evidences \u201ceither\nan inability to manage his finances and control his spending or is abusing the bankruptcy system to\nhis benefit.\u201d  Applicant filed for bankruptcy essentially every seven years. That evidence in a\n21\nvacuum would very easily lead to Department Counsel\u2019s argument. However, this is not a case in\nwhich Applicant used bankruptcy to erase his debts, then ran up more debts knowing that he would\neventually discharge them in bankruptcy. I very carefully reviewed Applicant\u2019s finances since his\nlast bankruptcy to see if there was any hint of that behavior. There was not. In assessing Applicant,\nI also considered his military service, and the favorable character evidence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The case was assigned to an administrative judge on May 25,\n2007 and reassigned to me on July 25, 2007, based on workload.  The case was heard as scheduled\non August 22, 2007.  I kept the record open until September 5, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit\nadditional evidence.  I received her evidence on September 4, 2007, and it was admitted as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) M, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September\n4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She has been director of\nengineering for her company since September 1997.  She has never held a clearance.\nApplicant and her company have received numerous accolades from major defense contracts\nfor the quality and responsiveness of their performance (AX A-E, I-L).  Applicant\u2019s company was\nrecently awarded a significant defense contract (AX F, G, H).\nApplicant was born in Argentina.  She and her family moved to Israel in 1972, and they all\nbecame Israeli citizens.  Applicant was married in Israel in August 1979.  She studied engineering at\nTel Aviv University but does not have a degree (Tr. 6).  She came to the U.S. in 1994 (Tr. 51), when\nshe was offered a job by a U.S. company.  She became a U.S. citizen in April 2003, and her husband\nbecame a U.S. citizen in July 2003.  They have three children, ages 24, 22, and 14, who were born\nin Israel and are now U.S. citizens (Tr. 66).\nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother, and sister are dual citizens of Argentina and Israel and reside in\nIsrael.  Her father-in-law and grandmother are citizens and residents of Israel.  Applicant traveled to\nIsrael, using her Israeli passport, to visit her family in December 1998, July 2000, December 2001,\nSeptember 2002, June 2004, and July 2005.  On each trip, she stayed with her parents for one or two\nweeks (Tr. 41).  \nOn August 30, 2007, Applicant surrendered her Israeli passport to the Israeli Consul General.\nShe also submitted a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Interior, declaring her understanding that she\n\n4\n\u201cwill not be entitled to receive any educational, medical or social benefits nor exercise any rights or\nprivileges of citizenship\u201d as a result of surrendering her passport (AX M). \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a private insurance broker in Israel (Tr. 43).  His wife is a social worker\nemployed by city to care for the elderly (Tr. 44).  They own their own home in Israel, which Applicant\nestimates is worth about $300,000 (Tr.42).  \nApplicant\u2019s father is 79 years old and her mother is 75 (Tr. 44).  Her mother is a self-\nemployed architect (Tr. 47).  Her father was an accountant for a labor union but is now retired,\nalthough he sometimes helps Applicant\u2019s brother with his insurance business (Tr. 48).  They have\nvisited Applicant in the U.S. about five times, the last time in June 2007 (Tr. 46).   Her brother has\nvisited twice (Tr. 45).\nApplicant and her brother have an informal fund to help support their parents financially.\nApplicant sends about $300 per month to her brother to help support their parents.  They are\nsurreptitious about using the fund, and they create \u201cmake work\u201d to keep their father occupied, to\navoid hurting his feelings (Tr. 61-63).\nApplicant\u2019s 95-year-old grandmother lives with Applicant\u2019s parents (Tr. 52).  She has never\nworked outside the home.  Applicant talks to her about once every three months, but finds it difficult\nto talk to her.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is deceased.  Her father-in-law is a retired truck driver (Tr. 60).\nApplicant and her husband talk to him every week or two, and he visits them every year (Tr. 60).\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen of Israel, but she lives and works in the U.S. as an information\nsystem manager for a furniture importing company.  Her sister returned to Argentina after living in\nIsrael for three years, and then came to the U.S. on a work visa (Tr. 63-64).  Her sister\u2019s husband also\nlives and works in the U.S. on a work visa.  Applicant visits with her sister once or twice a week (Tr.\n65).\nApplicant owns a condominium in Israel.  She purchased it in 1988 and estimates its value\nas somewhere between $150,000 and $180,000.  She relies on her father to manage the property, and\nher testimony at the hearing reflected that she is unfamiliar with the financial details of his\nmanagement of the property.  She knows it is rented for about $600 per month (Tr. 53), and her father\ncollects the rent and pays the mortgage (Tr. 54).  Her parents do not own a house, and she intends to\nhave the condominium available for their use as they become older and less able to pay rent.\nApplicant and her husband also own their home in the U.S., worth about $850,000 (Tr. 57). \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request and without objection from Applicant, I took administrative\nnotice of relevant adjudicative facts about Israel (Tr. 20; Hearing Exhibit (HX) I).  Israel is a\nparliamentary democracy with a diversified, technologically advanced economy.  Israel\u2019s major\nindustries include high-technology electric and biomedical equipment.  Almost half of Israel\u2019s exports\nare high-technology equipment.  The U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.  Israel generally respects\nthe human rights of its citizens, although there have been some issues respecting treatment of\nPalestinian detainees and discrimination against Arab citizens.\n\n5\nTerrorist attacks are a continuing threat in Israel, many of which are directed at American\ninterests.  Israel has given high priority to ending hostilities with Arab forces.  The Israeli Defense\nForce has close ties with the U.S., and the two countries participate in joint military exercises and\ncollaborate on military research and weapons development.\nThe U.S. is strongly committed to Israel\u2019s security and well being.  The two countries have\nstrong historic and cultural ties as well as mutual interests.  However, the U.S. has several concerns\nabout Israel, including its military sales to China, inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property,\nand several espionage cases in which classified documents or information were passed to Israeli\nofficials.  Israel has been identified as an active practitioner of industrial espionage.\nIsraeli citizens who become U.S. citizens retain their Israeli citizenship.  Israeli citizens,\nincluding dual nationals, are required to enter and depart Israel using an Israeli passport.  Israeli\nauthorities may require persons whom they consider to be Israeli citizens by birth to obtain an Israeli\npassport before departing Israel (HX 1, Enclosure II at 7).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the\napplicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance decision must be a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each specific\nguideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n\n6\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and holds an\nactive Israeli passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  She admitted both allegations.  The SOR does not allege, and\nDepartment Counsel did assert any security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s Argentine citizenship.\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate\na preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG \u00b6 9.  \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a\ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  This disqualifying condition is established by evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of an Israeli passport.  No other exercise of Israeli citizenship was\nalleged or proven.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(a).  This condition is\nestablished.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  Applicant\u2019s letter to the Israeli\nMinister of Interior declares that by surrendering her passport, she understands she \u201cwill not be\nentitled to receive any educational, medical or social benefits nor exercise any rights or privileges of\ncitizenship.\u201d  This letter appears to fall short of renouncing citizenship.  Based on the ambiguity of\nher letter, coupled with her reluctance at the hearing to renounce her citizenship, I conclude this\nmitigating condition is not established.\nHowever, dual citizenship is not a disqualifying condition unless it is exercised.  By\nsurrendering her passport, Applicant has relinquished the only means she is alleged to have used to\nexercise dual citizenship.  Furthermore, her letter to the Israeli government acknowledges that she will\nbe unable to exercise any rights or privileges of citizenship as a result of surrendering her passport.\n\n7\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s parents and brother are dual citizens of Argentina and Israel\nresiding in Israel (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b); her sister is a dual citizen of Argentina and Israel residing in\nthe U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.c); her father-in-law and grandmother are citizens and residents of Israel (SOR \u00b6\n2.d and 2.e).  It also alleges she owns a condominium in Israel (SOR \u00b6 2.f).  Finally, it alleges she\ntraveled to Israel in December 1998, July 2000, December 2001, September 2002, June 2004, and\nJuly 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.g).  Applicant admitted all the allegations.  Department Counsel did not assert\nany security concerns based on the Argentine citizenship of her parents and siblings.\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, a\ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Third, a security\nconcern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry . . , which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 7(e).  \nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive\u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign\ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n8\nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar.\n29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its\nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are\nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or\ndependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against\nthe U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s family members in Israel raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).  Her ownership of a\ncondominium in Israel raises AG \u00b6 7(e).  Although she does not appear to consider the condominium\nan investment property and seems somewhat unconcerned about how it is managed as a rental\nproperty, it is important to her as a future home for her parents.  Since the government produced\nsubstantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to\nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  Israel is a friendly country with numerous\nties and common interests with the U.S.  Industrial espionage cases involving Israel have been\nconducted by direct contact between U.S. citizens and Israeli operatives, not duress or intimidation\nof his own citizens.  Israel respects the human rights of its citizens and does not resort to abuse of its\nown citizens to gather economic or military intelligence from the U.S.  \nThe nature of Israel\u2019s government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the U.S.\nare clearly not determinative.  Nevertheless, they are all relevant factors in determining whether Israel\nwould risk damaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in\norder to force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  None of Applicant\u2019s family members in Israel are\ninvolved with the military or involved in high technology enterprises.  None are connected to the\ngovernment, except for a sister-in-law employed as a city social worker.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is\nestablished. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  Applicant has strong ties to the U.S., but she also has strong ties to\nher family in Israel.  Applicant has not carried her burden of establishing this mitigating condition.\nHowever, for the reasons set out above concerning AG \u00b6 8(a), it is highly unlikely she will ever placed\nin a situation where she must choose between the interests of her family and the interests of the U.S.\nSecurity concerns based on foreign property interests can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe value\nor routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely\n\n9\nto result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the\nindividual.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(f).  Applicant\u2019s condominium is not nearly as valuable as her primary home, but\nit is important to Applicant as a future home for her parents.  I conclude this condition is not\nestablished.  However, for the reasons discussed above, I also conclude that it is highly unlikely that\nIsrael would use her property interests as leverage to obtain protected information.\nApplicant\u2019s travel to Israel, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, was to visit her family.  Her travel has no\nsecurity significance independent of her feelings of affection and obligation for her family.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Some\nof these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult.  She was candid, thoughtful, sincere, and credible at the hearing.\nSurrendering her passport undoubtedly was a difficult decision, because it can significantly\ncomplicate her ability to visit her aging parents.  She is a hard-working, self-made, successful\nprofessional, respected in the community of defense contractors.  She has chosen to make a life for\nherself and her family in the U.S.  She, her husband, and their three children, two of whom are adults,\nall have become U.S. citizens.  Her ties to Israel are familial, not political or ideological.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C and B, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude she has\ncarried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a\nsecurity clearance.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C (Foreign Preference):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline B (Foreign Influence):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT DOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicant's parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and two of his three brothers (SOR \u00b6 1.b) are resident citizens of Nepal; that his sister is a resident citizen of India (SOR 3 \u00b6 1.c); that his other brother resides in India as well but as a citizen of Nepal (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that Applicant owns a small parcel of land in Nepal (SOR \u00b6 1.e); that he has a bank account in India into which he transfers about $700 monthly to care for his family (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that he traveled to Nepal and India in July 2000, October 2001, and December 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant admitted the allegations, but offered in mitigation that his parents spend most of their time in India, that he had already applied for his sister and one brother's immigration to the U.S., and was in the process of doing the same for his parents and other two brothers. He added that his brothers were all in India where they are pursuing college degrees. As for his property in Nepal, Applicant indicated it was owned by everyone in the family, and that the significant elements of his net worth (savings, retirement accounts, real estate) are in the U.S. He described the amount in his overseas account as small and to help his parents and siblings with their expenses. The purpose of his travel in 2000, 2001, and 2003 was to spend time with his relatives, and he volunteered that he went to India in April 2007, again to see his family members.

Foreign\ninfluence concerns raised by the Nepali citizenship and Indian residency of his parents and brothers,\nand the Indian citizenship and residency of his sister are mitigated by his strong ties to the United\nStates.

As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 11, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign influence) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\n\nThe functions previously exercised by the National Counterintelligence Center, such as issuing the annual\n1\nreport on foreign economic collection and industrial espionage, have been assumed by the Office of the National\nCounterintelligence Executive.\n2\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant\nwhen the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on June 27, 2007, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2007. Counsel\nfor Applicant entered his appearance on October 22, 2007.\nOn November 8, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Two government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-2) and ten Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-J) were admitted. Applicant and one witness, a friend\nwho has known him since early 2004, testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA\non November 21, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn September 12, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning Nepal and India. The request concerning Nepal was based on publications\nof the U.S. State Department: Background Note: Nepal, dated May 2007; Country Reports on\nHuman Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007; Consular Information Sheet: Nepal, dated June\n27, 2007; Travel Warning: Nepal, dated May 7, 2007; and Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter\n2, dated April 30, 2007. Concerning India, the source documents were the State Department\u2019s\nBackground Note: India, dated December 2006; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006,\nIndia, dated March 6, 2007; Background Note: Iran, dated June 2007; and Consular Information\nSheet: India, dated July 17, 2007; the Congressional Research Service\u2019s report for Congress, India-\nU.S. Relations, updated June 26, 2007; the National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage-2000; and the Office of the\nNational Counterintelligence Executive\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Espionage-2005.1\nOn October 5, 2007, I informed the parties that consistent with DOHA Appeal Board rulings\nstressing consideration of the most current political conditions in foreign countries (see ISCR Case\nNo. 05-11292, Apr. 12, 2007), I intend to review for purposes of taking administrative notice an\nupdated travel warning on Nepal issued by the State Department on September 24, 2007. No\nobjections were filed to the request for administrative notice or to my consideration of the updated\ntravel warning. After weighing the reliability of the source documentation, including the updated\ntravel warning, and assessing the relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed, I took\nadministrative notice of certain facts pertinent to Nepal and to India as set forth below.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicant's parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and two of his three\nbrothers (SOR \u00b6 1.b) are resident citizens of Nepal; that his sister is a resident citizen of India (SOR\n\n3\n\u00b6 1.c); that his other brother resides in India as well but as a citizen of Nepal (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that\nApplicant owns a small parcel of land in Nepal (SOR \u00b6 1.e); that he has a bank account in India into\nwhich he transfers about $700 monthly to care for his family (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that he traveled to\nNepal and India in July 2000, October 2001, and December 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant admitted\nthe allegations, but offered in mitigation that his parents spend most of their time in India, that he\nhad already applied for his sister and one brother's immigration to the U.S., and was in the process\nof doing the same for his parents and other two brothers. He added that his brothers were all in India\nwhere they are pursuing college degrees. As for his property in Nepal, Applicant indicated it was\nowned by everyone in the family, and that the significant elements of his net worth (savings,\nretirement accounts, real estate) are in the U.S. He described the amount in his overseas account as\nsmall and to help his parents and siblings with their expenses. The purpose of his travel in 2000,\n2001, and 2003 was to spend time with his relatives, and he volunteered that he went to India in\nApril 2007, again to see his family members. Applicant indicated that his spouse and children are\nnative U.S. citizens, and that he and his spouse take seriously the obligations of U.S. citizenship.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take\nadministrative notice, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old engineer who has worked for his present employer since October\n2006. He is seeking his first security clearance.\nApplicant was born in Nepal in January 1969 to Nepali resident citizens who had followed\nthe family avocation of Hindu priest. His parents did not hold formal jobs but lived off of what they\nwere offered in exchange for their services and from cultivating a small plot of land they owned.\nThere was no school in his district in Nepal, so the family moved across the border to his mother\u2019s\nnative India where Applicant and his sister attended school. His sister was born in India in January\n1964. His parents subsequently returned to the village in Nepal, and had three more sons, who were\nborn in February 1974, February 1980, and March 1983.\nAfter finishing his schooling in engineering (he holds an electrical engineering certificate)\nand hospitality management in India, Applicant moved to Kathmandu in 1991. Until 1994, he was\nemployed full-time as a manager of a five star hotel, and as a part-time science and math teacher at\na local high school. In June 1994, Applicant came to the U.S. on a business visa. A few weeks after\nhe arrived, he learned of sporadic ethnic violence between Hindus and Muslims on both sides of the\nborder between Nepal and India. With the tourist economy in Nepal declining, and uneasy about the\nethnic tensions, Applicant applied for political asylum in the U.S. While his application was\npending, he was authorized to work in the U.S. He began employment with a hotel who eventually\nsponsored him for labor certification. In October 1996, he renewed his Nepali passport.\nIn about late 1997, Applicant began corresponding by computer with his future spouse. He\nnoticed her profile on an ethnic marriage website, and discovered they had mutual friends. She was\nemployed as a software engineer in a distant U.S. state. After some high-tech dating and a couple\nof in-person meetings, he relocated to her area in December 1998, and they married in January 1999.\nHis spouse\u2019s parents emigrated from India to the U.S. in the late1950s and became naturalized U.S.\ncitizens. Applicant\u2019s spouse and her sister were born in the U.S. On his marriage to a U.S. citizen,\nApplicant withdrew his labor certification and asylum applications.\n\nApplicant testified that he does not own the property in Nepal (\u201cDirectly, I don\u2019t own anything., I stand to\n2\ninherit, as I, and that was one result of analysis paralysis in my mind at the time of filling out initially the statement of\nreasons and everything else. I interpreted, since I stand to inherit as something that I stand to own, but the fact is I don\u2019t\ndirectly own anything else, they are all\u2013in the name of my parents. I may inherit the small piece of land that my parents\n4\nIn March 1999, Applicant began working as a sales manager for a hotel. In January 2000, he\nbegan studies toward a bachelor of science degree in information technology while continuing to\nwork in the hotel industry. In April 2000, he got his first job as a software engineer at a networking\ninternet company. From July 28, 2000, to August 11, 2000, Applicant traveled to Nepal and India\nto visit his parents and siblings.\nFrom December 2000 to January 2004, Applicant was employed as a senior software\nengineer for a company in his local area. In September 2001, Applicant renewed his Nepali passport\nfor another five years, and he traveled to Nepal and India from October 20, 2001 to November 5,\n2001, and from December 5, 2003 to December 25, 2003, to visit family members. \nIn January 2004, Applicant was laid off. He was unemployed for over a year, except for some\nshort term consulting work in 2005. He  finished his studies for his bachelor of science degree, and\ncared for their first child, a son, who was born in December 2004. He also acquired his U.S.\ncitizenship in September 2004, taking an oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and\ndefend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or\ncivilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant obtained a U.S. passport on October 7,\n2004, and returned his Nepali passport to the Embassy of Nepal. He understood that by becoming\na U.S. citizen and turning in his passport he was no longer a citizen of Nepal.\nIn April 2005, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as a software lead for future\ncombat systems. Applicant accepted the job in part because of its onsite daycare. Because of the\npotential for classified work on the program, Applicant executed a security clearance application on\nApril 29, 2005. He disclosed that his parents and two of his brothers were resident citizens of Nepal,\nthat his middle brother was a Nepali citizen residing in India, and that his sister was a resident citizen\nof India. Applicant also indicated that he owned a small parcel of land in Nepal from birth that he\nhad held a Nepali passport but returned it to the Nepali embassy following his U.S. naturalization,\nand that he had traveled to Nepal and India for pleasure in 2000, 2001, and 2003.\nOn February 16, 2006, Applicant was interviewed for his clearance. He indicated that he\nmaintained a bank account in India into which is deposited funds for his relatives.\nApplicant played a key role in the special test and demonstration activities involving a\nground sensor program. He was dedicated to his work and trustworthy with respect to the\ninformation associated with the program. Yet in October 2006, he elected to leave that job to work\nfor his present employer, a larger defense contractor in the region, for its better benefits, including\nflexibility and job security. His clearance application was transferred to his current employer.\nIn December 2006, DOHA asked Applicant to provide details concerning his foreign\nfinancial interests. Since he may inherit the land that his parents own in Nepal, Applicant responded\nthat he had interests in Nepal as well as India: a small piece of land with an estimated value of\n$5,000 USD  and checking/savings accounts for family expenses with an estimated $9,000 USD on\n2\n\nown which is, you know, a rough equivalent, it can be no, of no greater value than $5K U.S., as we speak, and that\ndivided by five, I roughly say I stand to inherit roughly worth $1K U.S.\u201d). (Tr. 92)\n5\ndeposit. He was sending about $700 per month from his U.S. account to the account in India. At\nDOHA\u2019s request, Applicant estimated his net worth at $575,000 (real estate, cash, bank accounts,\nvehicles, furniture, jewelry, personal effects, household furnishings). Applicant added that his\nspouse, who works for the same employer at a different facility, has an existing security clearance,\nand that he was committed to fulfilling his obligations with integrity that is consistent with the U.S.\nnational interest.\nAs a performance excellence engineer on a Homeland Security program, Applicant is\ninvolved in mission assurance, making sure that engineering teams deliver their products on time\nand correctly. A program security manager who had previously worked with Applicant in early 2007\nattests to Applicant\u2019s \u201ctireless dedication to getting the job done.\u201d (Ex. J) A senior principal engineer\nwho met Applicant at a cultural learn-at-lunch series at the company has observed nothing that\nwould cause him to question Applicant\u2019s integrity or lead him to believe that Applicant would act\ncontrary to the interests of the U.S. or their employer. A principal quality engineer who coached\nApplicant on a qualification project found Applicant to be committed to the success of the company\nand its customers.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a senior systems engineer. She is employed by the same defense\ncontractor as Applicant, but at another facility. She held a security clearance from 1992 to 1997 for\nher duties with a previous employer and has held a secret-level clearance in her present job since\n2003. All of her immediate family members are resident citizens of the U.S. A lifelong resident, she\nhas no plans to move outside of the U.S. She and Applicant have been briefed about their\nresponsibilities to report any planned foreign travel to their security officer so they can receive the\nappropriate briefing. \nApplicant and his spouse own their home in the U.S. Their total net worth in the U.S. is about\n$730,450.25. Applicant has donated his time to a local shelter, cooking, delivering and serving meals\nat least once a month. Applicant and his spouse are involved in a society for women engineers. He\nhas also volunteered his time to educate Girl Scouts in a science and engineering badge event.\nSince 2006, Applicant\u2019s parents have resided with Applicant\u2019s brothers in India primarily but\nspend a few months with Applicant and his family in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s brothers, all Nepali\ncitizens, are full-time students at the same university in India. The oldest of his brothers, who had\nbeen an accountant, moved to India to pursue an undergraduate degree in computer applications,\nstarting in July 2005. He plans to earn his degree in July 2008. Applicant\u2019s other brothers are seeking\ntheir master\u2019s degrees in computer applications, which they expect will be awarded in 2010. The\nyoungest brother moved to India from Nepal in 2006, and commenced his graduate studies in\nJanuary 2007.  The other brother earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in India. All three brothers are expert\nyoga teachers and they earn enough to meet most of their educational expenses.\nApplicant still sends his relatives in India about $700 monthly so the two younger brothers\ncan finish their educations sooner. The funds are deposited into Applicant\u2019s credit union savings\naccount in the U.S. that is linked with a non resident account in India. Applicant transfers the funds\nonline into his account in India, and from there into his brother\u2019s account at the same bank. His\n\n6\nrelatives do not have control over Applicant\u2019s account. Applicant\u2019s sister is a widow who lives with\nher in-laws in a locale over a day-and-a-half journey by train from her brothers in India. She never\nworked outside of the home.  Applicant\u2019s family members in India are aware he and his spouse are\nengineers, but otherwise know little about their jobs. Applicant contacts his brothers weekly by\nemail. He speaks with his relatives by telephone a few times per month or as necessary. He is in\ntouch with his sister once every couple of months. None of his family members intends to return to\nNepal to live.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings intend to immigrate to the U.S. Applicant filed the\nimmigration petitions for his sister and the eldest of his three brothers in September 2006. Applicant\nintends to apply for his parents\u2019 immigration as soon as one of his siblings emigrates to the U.S. or\nif one of his brothers comes to the U.S. for employment. Since he and his spouse are employed full-\ntime, Applicant wants a sibling here to help his parents acclimate to life in the U.S. Applicant, his\nspouse, and their two young children traveled to India to see his relatives in April 2007. Applicant\ntransferred extra funds into his account in India so they would have funds available to them during\ntheir trip. As of November 2007, Applicant\u2019s total deposits in the bank in India amounted to 125,018\nIndia National Rupees or about $3,125.45 USD.\nI note the following facts with respect to India and Nepal and their respective relationships\nwith the U.S. India is a stable multiparty federal democratic republic with a bicameral parliament.\nThe central government has broad administrative powers in relation to its states. Indian society and\npolitical organization are determined largely by the Hindu caste system of occupational and social\nhierarchies, although the influence of those factors has been diluted if not subsumed in the\neconomically prosperous and heterogeneous cities. The Indian government generally respected the\nrights of its citizens in 2006, although serious problems persisted in some areas, in part because of\na lack of accountability in the government and security forces and lax enforcement of the human\nrights laws. Human rights abuses and terrorist acts have been committed in recent years by separatist\nguerillas, Maoist insurgents from Nepal, and other terrorists, due to longstanding internal factional\nand ethnic conflicts.\nLong an active member of the UN, India remains a leader in the developing world and the\nnon-aligned movement. It has a long tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations. India\nwas identified as an active collector of sensitive U.S. economic information in 2000. The U.S.\nrecognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to strengthen its relationship with India,\nespecially since 2004. Both countries are committed to political freedom protected by representative\ngovernment, and share common interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting terrorism, and\nin creating a strategically stable Asia. Differences with the U.S. over India\u2019s nuclear weapons\nprogram and pace of economic reform exist. India has growing energy ties with Iran that involve the\nconstruction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan. The U.S. opposes\nthis, but is committed to continuing a strong, dynamic partnership with India. In June 2005, the U.S.\nand India signed a ten-year defense pact outlining planned collaboration in multilateral operations,\nexpanded two-way defense trade and increasing technology transfer opportunities. The current U.S.\nadministration is committed to assisting India in meeting its energy needs through sharing civilian\nnuclear technology and increasing cooperation in science and technology to address public health\nand environmental concerns.\n\n7\nNepal is an ethnically diverse country wedged between the People\u2019s Republic of China and\nIndia. Nepal was established as a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch in\nNovember 1990, but the decade was marked by a succession of governments, including the world\u2019s\nfirst communist monarchy. In February 1996, the Communist Maoist United People\u2019s Front began\na violent insurgency, waged through killing, torture, bombing, kidnaping, extortion, and intimidation\nagainst civilians, police, and public officials. \u201cImperialist\u201d U.S. and \u201cexpansionist\u201d India were the\ntargets of considerable Maoist venom. In November 2006, the Maoists entered into a comprehensive\npeace agreement with the Nepali government to end the decade long insurgency, and in January\n2007, an interim constitution was endorsed. On April 1, 2007, the ruling eight-party government\nthrough a political consensus formed an interim Council of Ministers that includes five Maoist\nministers.\nThe interim constitution expresses full commitment to democratic ideals and norms,\nincluding competitive multiparty democracy, civil liberties, fundamental human rights, adult\nenfranchisement, periodic elections, press freedom, an independent judiciary, and the rule of law.\nIncidents of human rights violations by government security forces, which had been numerous and\ngrave before April 2006, declined substantially. Maoists continued to engage in violence, extortion,\nabductions, and forced recruitment of school children. Sporadic incidents of terrorism and\npolitically-motivated violence in major urban areas, including near-simultaneous blasts of\nimprovised explosive devices at three locations in Kathmandu in September 2007 led the U.S.\nDepartment of State to warn U.S. citizens contemplating travel to Nepal. Ethnic tensions have led\nto random, indiscriminate violent clashes between Maoist splinter groups and indigenous groups,\nand to closures of the southern border with India. Maoist demonstrators have stopped and in some\ncases attacked diplomatic vehicles, including those of the U.S. Embassy.\nThe U.S. has designated the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) as a global terrorist\norganization. Maoists are excluded from the U.S. and U.S. citizens are barred by law from\ncontributing funds, goods, or services to, or for the benefit of, the Maoists. The government of Nepal\nformally lifted its designation of the Maoists as a terrorist organization on May 3, 2006. As of 2007,\nthe U.S. is the only country to maintain its designation of the Maoist insurgency as a terrorist\norganization.\nNepal is a member of the United Nations and of the World Trade Organization. Relations\nbetween the U.S. and Nepal have always been friendly. Since 1951, the U.S. has provided more than\n$791 million in bilateral economic assistance to Nepal. Nepal also receives substantial external\nassistance from India, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. The\nNepali Army has contributed significantly to UN peacekeeping missions. The U.S. has given $21.95\nmillion in grant assistance to the Nepali Army, and many Nepali Army officers attend U.S. military\nschools, conferences, and seminars. Nepal has generally had good bilateral relations with China since\n1956. Nepal has traditionally had close relations with India because of strong cultural, religious,\nlinguistic and economic ties. India and Nepal restored trade relations in 1990 after a break caused\nby India\u2019s concerns over Nepal\u2019s relationship with China.\nPOLICIES\n\nThe government did not move to amend the SOR to reflect that his parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and two of his three\n3\nbrothers (SOR \u00b6 1.b) are now living in India and not Nepal as originally alleged. The SOR is not measured against a\nstandard of perfection, and DC \u00b6 7(a) applies whether they are living in Nepal or India.\n8\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B,  foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6\n6) Applicant\u2019s parents and three brothers are Nepali citizens currently living in India, and his sister\nis an Indian citizen who resides with her in-laws in India.  Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a)\n3\n(contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies.\nIn SOR \u00b6 1.e, the government alleged that Applicant owned a small parcel of land in Nepal,\nbased apparently on his assertions of ownership on his clearance application, during a subject\ninterview in February 2006, and when he answered the SOR. However, Applicant testified credibly\n\u2014with no rebuttal from the government\u2014that the property is in his parents\u2019 names. Since his is an\ninheritance interest of limited value (one-fifth share worth about $1,000 USD) it is not likely to\nsubject him to the heightened risk of foreign influence that is contemplated within DC \u00b6 7(e) (a\n\n9\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\nor foreign operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation). \nAs alleged, Applicant has an account with a banking institution in India into which he\ndeposits about $700 per month (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He also traveled to Nepal and India in July 2000,\nOctober 2001, and December 2003, and to India only in April 2007 to visit his parents and siblings\n(SOR \u00b6 1.g). His financial support for his relatives and his travels abroad are relevant to the extent\nthey demonstrate the closeness of the bond Applicant shares with his relatives in India. His deposits\non account in India\u2014about $3,125.45 USD\u2014amount to less than 1 percent of his total net worth,\nso they are not a substantial foreign interest. Routine contacts with officials at the border do not raise\nthe concerns contemplated within DC \u00b6 7(j) (conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S.,\nwhich may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country).\nApplicant\u2019s bonds of affection and/or obligation with his parents and siblings are clear. Not\nonly does he support them (primarily his two youngest brothers) financially, but he also has\nsponsored his sister and the eldest brother for immigration to the U.S. The ties are too strong to meet\nthe first prong of mitigating condition (MC)  \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with the foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in the country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having\nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.).\nThe political situation in Nepal remains a relevant consideration because of the Nepali\ncitizenship of his parents and brothers. Yet, his parents and brothers are all residing in India, more\nthan a day and a half\u2019s drive from the border with Nepal, and are considerably less vulnerable to\ninfluence from Nepal.\nAs for the potential for coercion from India, I am mindful India and the U.S. do not always\nshare the same interests (e.g., Pakistan, India-Iran ties). However, it is unlikely India, the world\u2019s\nmost populous democracy, is going to jeopardize its friendship with the U.S. by exerting improper\ninfluence on Applicant\u2019s relatives who live a low profile existence. His parents never held jobs other\nthan as Hindu priests. The eldest of his brothers had previously worked as an accountant, and is now\npursuing an undergraduate degree in computer applications. Both younger brothers are undertaking\ngraduate study in the same discipline. Applicant\u2019s sister is a widow who does not work outside the\nhome. MC \u00b6 8(a) applies.\nFurthermore, in the unlikely event of undue foreign influence from Nepali or Indian\nauthorities, Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. (\u00b6 8(b) (there is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in the U.S.)). Since coming to the U.S. on a business visa in June 1994,\nApplicant has developed very significant ties to the U.S. (education, career, home ownership,\ncitizenship, marriage to a native U.S. citizen). Within months of his arrival in the U.S., he wanted\n\n10\nto stay (\u201cit was soon after, a few months after I started working here in the United States. And then\nit was part of that desire that prompted me to pursue the labor certification, in spite of the fact that\nI had the existing other application pending. So at that point, professionally and legally, I wanted to\nleave no stone unturned that would allow me, that would allow me to stay in the United States.\u201d Tr.\n125).

On February 7, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive\n\n2\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.\nOn May 31, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a favorable trustworthiness determination.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant has raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ntrustworthiness determination under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant was born in Iran in 1978.  Though he became a U.S. citizen\nin 2003, Applicant admitted that he has exercised dual citizenship.  He has maintained an Iranian\npassport since 1978 in order to travel to Iran and visit relatives.  He intends to use the passport in the\nfuture.  Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Iran but live in the U.S. as permanent residents.  Iran is an\nactive state sponsor of terrorism and is attempting to obtain weapons of mass destruction.  The\nIranian government has harassed and detained dual citizens of the United States and Iran.  \nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness determination if the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising\ntrustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating\nconditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nand whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A\ntrustworthiness determination must be guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.\nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s Guideline C trustworthiness concerns, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s\nretention of an Iranian passport with intent for future use.  He also noted the fact that Applicant\u2019s\nresponses to the SOR and to the File of Relevant Material do not contain an expression of\nwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  When viewed in light of the hostile nature of the\nIranian regime to U.S. interests, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of\npersuasion.  Based on its review of the findings and the record as a whole, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary\nto law.  In light of this conclusion, the Board need not address the appeal issues raised under\nGuideline B.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 12, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2007, and requested a decision without\na hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the\ngovernment\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on June 5, 2007.  Applicant was\nafforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by July 5, 2007.  He filed no response.  The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR, but provided explanations for the\nalleged debts.  He admitted providing inaccurate answers on his security questionnaire but denied\nit was intentional.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 53-year-old sanitation technician employed by a federal contractor.   He was\n2\nmarried in February 1990, and separated in July 2005.   He has no children.   He is a high school\n3\n4\ngraduate.   He served in the National Guard from 1972 to 1976.   This is his first application for a\n5\n6\nsecurity clearance.7\n\nSOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.m; Items 5 and 6 (Credit Reports, dated May 31, 2006 and December 22, 2006,\n8\nrespectively).\n Item 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated February 12, 2007) at 7-8.\n9\nItem 3, supra, note 9, at 5-6.\n10\nItem 1, supra, note 1, at 22.\n11\nItem 3, supra, note 9, at 3-4.\n12\n4\nApplicant had 14 delinquent debts totaling over $17,500.   Many of the debts became\n8\ndelinquent before mid-2002, and remained delinquent up to the date of the FORM.  In his answer,\nhe claimed that he had satisfied six of the debts but provided proof as to only two.   As of March 12,\n9\n2007, he employed the services of a credit counseling agency to assist in consolidating his debts,\ncounseling him, and providing assistance in managing his finances.  Even most of the consolidated\ndebts will not be completely repaid until 2010.   There is no evidence that his debts were caused by\n10\nfactors beyond his control.  Instead, they result from poor money management.  He claimed that one\nof the debts was his wife\u2019s obligation, but there is no documentation to substantiate the claim.  \nApplicant falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), executed by him on May 18, 2006, by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the following\nquestions: \u201cSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies a.  In the last 7 years, have you been over\n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? and Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies b.  Are you\ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?   He deliberately failed to list the information set\n11\nforth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.m.  He claimed these were oversights and that he did not\ndeliberately try to deceive the government.12\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.  Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n13\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005);  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n14\n \nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n5\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n13\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.14\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a\ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case: Guideline \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and Guideline \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20(a), (b),\nand (e) do not apply.  The debts continued to be delinquent until recently, there is no evidence of\nfactors beyond Applicant\u2019s control that accounted for the delinquencies,  and there is no basis to\ndispute most of the indebtedness.  However, Guidelines \u00b6 20 (c) and (d) are at issue.  Applicant did\nseek financial counseling, but only after the SOR was issued, and based on his prior record, the\nlikelihood of successful completion could be in doubt.  Because he does not have his finances under\ncontrol, the mitigating condition under Guideline \u00b6 20 (b) is not totally applicable.  There is\ninsufficient proof of serious debt reduction to conclude that Applicant has initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve the debts.  Therefore Guideline \u00b6 20 (d) does\nnot apply.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 15.\n15\n7\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, \u201cconduct involving...lack of candor [or] dishonesty...can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process.\u201d  One personal conduct disqualifying condition is particularly relevant\nand may be disqualifying in this case.  Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides, \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nThe concern under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is that conduct involving questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard sensitive\ninformation.\u201d   Applicant\u2019s SF 86 (e-QIP version) had incorrect answers to questions, 28 (a) and\n15\n(b).  However, Applicant denied that he intentionally falsified the answers by not listing his\ndelinquent debts.  He claimed these omissions were \u201coversights.\u201d  Applicant knew he had a number\nof delinquent debts when he submitted his e-QIP.  He did not adequately explain how an \u201coversight\u201d\ncaused him to incorrectly answer these basic questions.\nGuideline \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\ntruthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability;\n\n8\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under\ncircumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nNone of these conditions apply.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\n \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant has made little progress resolving his debts.  He is 53 years old, sufficiently mature to be\nfully responsible for his obligations.\nI considered his age (53), his education, his employment, and what might motivate him to\nbe less than truthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance application.  This is\nproblematic because candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a\ntrustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself, then he\nmay be trusted with confidential or classified information.  Although not alleged in the SOR, these\nfalse statements are separate violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  The totality of the record raises\nreasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to\nexercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue Applicant=s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He answered the SOR 14 March 2007. DOHA assigned\n1\nthe case to me 29 June 2007 and I convened a hearing 1 August 2007. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) 15 August 2007.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate those admissions\nas findings of fact. He is a 45-year-old senior systems engineer for a defense contractor since\nDecember 2004, and seeks access to classified information. During the pendency of this clearance\napplication, he held an interim secret clearance without incident from December 2004 until\nDecember 2006.\nApplicant was born in Lebanon in February 1962. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1985.  He\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1987, and obtained his U.S. passport a few days later.\nApplicant met his wife while attending graduate school in 1987. She is a native-born U.S.\ncitizen. They have four children, all native-born U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s wife and children lived\nin Lebanon from September 1997 to March 2000 so that Applicant could come visit them on\nweekends.  At the time, Applicant worked for a software vendor who had assigned him to clients\nin Saudi Arabia and Holland. Applicant\u2019s travel to Lebanon from 1997 to 2000 was related to his\nfamily visits; his trip to Lebanon in 2002 was business related. Applicant and his wife own their\nhome in the U.S., and have substantial sums in retirement and cash accounts in the U.S. They have\nno financial interests in Lebanon.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are long divorced. His father is a resident citizen of Lebanon who retired\nas a police officer in the early 1970s. He lives in an assisted living facility. Applicant has had no\ncontact with him since 2002. Applicant\u2019s mother is also a citizen of Lebanon, but she resides with\nApplicant because she has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She is a retired teacher with\na lump sum pension.\nApplicant\u2019s brothers, sisters, and half-brother are resident citizens of Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s\nhalf brother is an automobile salesman, and Applicant cannot remember the last time he had contact\nwith him. One brother works as a contract payroll administrator for the Lebanese Finance Ministry.\nHis wife manages a mini-market that they own. Applicant\u2019s other brother retired three years ago as\na colonel in the Lebanese Army, receiving a lump-sum pension. One of Applicant\u2019s sisters is a\nhousewife, married to an architect. His other sister is a teacher, married to a retired Lebanese Army\nbrigadier general.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nLebanon is a nominal democracy with a less-than-perfect human rights record. It has both\na long history of civil war and of foreign influence by Syria. Lebanon is not a state sponsor of\nterrorism, but is a permissive environment for groups recognized by the U.S. as terrorist\norganizations, considered by Lebanon as \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d against Israel. The U.S. State\nDepartment continues to maintain a travel warning for U.S. citizens contemplating travel to\nLebanon.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, coworker, and facility security officer attested to Applicant work\nethic and trustworthiness. In addition, he has never had a security violation.\nPOLICIES AND BURDENS\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However,\nspecific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them,\nas they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country\nis known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n3\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected\ninformation, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the\nindividual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an\nindividual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise\nsecurity concerns only if those contacts create a heightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.4\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline\nB. Considering first the country involved, Lebanon and the U.S. enjoy good foreign relations. It has\nnot been demonstrated that the Lebanese government is actively engaged in the collection of U.S.\nintelligence such that would make Applicant or his family likely targets for coercion, duress, or\ninfluence. The government\u2019s evidence explains the links to terrorism that are on-going in Lebanon\nand the way that those terrorist organizations operate, the increase in terrorism, and the increase in\nmembership in terrorist groups. Several of the groups that are frequently in the news, for example\nHizballah and Hamas, operate in Lebanon and practice terrorist acts against Israelis and against U.S.\ncitizens as well as indiscriminate violence in order to draw attention to themselves and increase their\nmembership and their power. There is no indication they use terrorism to gain access to U.S.\ninformation.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence that there was\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because\nof Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Lebanon. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have an\ndirect connection to the Lebanese government, and there is nothing in the past connections of his\nfather, his brother, or his brother-in-law to raise a concern over protecting classified information.\nFurther, Applicant has been in the U.S. more than 22 years. His wife and children are here All his\nfinancial interests are here. His contacts with family members range in Lebanon range from nearly\nnon-existent to casual, but there is nothing in the circumstances of their being in Lebanon, or in\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that he could be impelled or compelled to\nprovide protected information to Lebanon. Under these circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely\nApplicant can be pressured based on his family members in Lebanon. Accordingly, I resolve\nGuideline B for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n   Paragraph 1.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFrancisco Mendez, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in the U.S. but has lived and worked in Japan since at least 1992. The\nresident citizenship in Japan of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members is mitigated. They are not\nagents of a foreign power, and it is unlikely Japan would try to apply pressure or coercion on and\nthrough them to Applicant. His one-time failure to register himself with the Selective Service System\n(SSS) no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is\ngranted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\n\n2\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On February 2, 2007, under Executive Order 10865 and Department\nof Defense Directive 5200.6, dated January 2, 1992, reissued through Change 4, April 20, 1999, with\nrevised adjudicative guidelines implemented on September 1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns raised under the foreign influence\nguideline (Guideline B) and the personal conduct guideline (Guideline E) of the Directive. In his\nanswer, notarized on February 20, 2007, Applicant requested a decision be made on the record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on July 24, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on\nAugust 1, 2007. Response was due on August 31, 2007. No response was received. The case was\nassigned to me for decision on November 1, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nIn Section I of the FORM, the Government requested I take official notice of Items 8 through\n15, and explained the relevance of the noticed exhibits in Section III. Based on my authority to take\nofficial notice of well-known facts or government reports, I have taken official notice of the\ninformation related to Japan. I have also taken official notice of the Selective Service Act of 1917,\n(40 Stat.76), and the online site of the SSS, Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs at\nhttp://www.sss.gov, and referred to in Item 6.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the seven foreign influence allegations under paragraph 1. He also\nadmitted that he did not register with the United States SSS, believing the registration was voluntary.\nWhen he attempted to register, his application was rejected due to his age. \nApplicant, 34 years old, was born in the United States in October 1973. He has lived in Japan\nsince he was very young. His security clearance form (SCA, Item 4) discloses that he attended\ncollege in Japan for five years between 1992 and 1997. He did not receive a diploma. The SCA also\nreflects that Applicant has worked in Japan since at least 1992 (subparagraph 1.g.). \nApplicant's spouse (subparagraph 1.a.) was born in July 1973 in Japan; they were married\nin the country in June 1997. She is a sales clerk in a candy store. According to Applicant, she is not\nan agent of a foreign power, and not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. Applicant's\nnine-year-old child (subparagraph 1.b.), a resident citizen of Japan, resides with Applicant and his\nspouse at the current residence listed in module 4 of Applicant's SCA (Item 4). His son attends\nprivate school. \nApplicant's mother (subparagraph 1.c.) is a resident citizen of Japan, living with Applicant's\nfather until recently as reported by Applicant in his answer to the SOR on February 20, 2007. She\nis 59 years old and is a retired homemaker. When his father retires from his civilian position with\nthe U.S. Department of Defense, Applicant's mother will retire with him in Hawaii or Guam.\n\n3\nApplicant indicates she is not an agent of a foreign power. Applicant's father (subparagraph 1.d.),\n57 years old, is a citizen of the United States U.S. However, he moved from Japan, and is now a\nresident of the U.S., although Applicant does not know whether his new address will be his current\nresidence. \nApplicant's mother-in-law (subparagraph 1.e.), 47 years old, lives about a block from\nApplicant's family; he sees her several times a week. She owns a restaurant. Applicant's brother-in-\nlaw (subparagraph 1.f.), 29 years old, lives with Applicant's mother-in-law, and works as a cook in\nthe mother-in-law\u2019s restaurant. Applicant sees him about once a week. \nNot alleged in the SOR, but identified as a relative in Applicant\u2019s August 1, 2006 interview\nis his grandmother, 87 years old and a retired homemaker. Applicant contacts her by telephone\nseveral times a year. Applicant\u2019s uncle is 57 years old and a business owner. Applicant has not seen\nhis uncle in about five years. \nThe relatives (resident citizens of Japan) not alleged in the SOR on his wife\u2019s side of the\nfamily include his spouse\u2019s sister, 32 years old, employed as a beautician, and married to a sales\nrepresentative. Applicant sees her about once a month. His spouse also has an aunt who is a sales\nclerk, and a grandmother (retired homemaker) who lives with Applicant's mother-in-law. Applicant\nsees his wife's aunt and grandmother every three to six months. \nApplicant has held eight employment positions in Japan (subparagraph 1.g.) since 1992 (Item\n4) His employers have been mostly U.S. corporations providing information services to the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense in Japan. Since August 2003, Applicant's primary employment (as indicated\nin his SCA) has been a database administrator with a defense contractor (U.S. company). The\ncontractor performs work on the same U.S. installation that his father was assigned. Currently, he\nis a financial systems analyst. Since March 2001, Applicant has also been employed part-time as an\nEnglish language instructor. \nAccording to the interview with Applicant on August 1, 2006, he does not believe any of his\nrelatives are connected to any foreign government. None of his relatives have asked questions about\nhis work, his security clearance or sensitive government information. Applicant does not have any\npreference or allegiance for any country outside the U.S., and will follow security procedures by\nreporting any suspicious efforts to contact him. \nApplicant has a Japanese bank account that is primarily used to cover his son's education\nexpenses. He has a checking account that he uses to pay bills. Applicant also has a bank account that\nhe uses for travel. Applicant's last account is with the credit union. \nThe personal conduct allegation (subparagraph 2.a.) arises from Applicant\u2019s negative answer\nto question 18 (have you registered with the SSS?) of the SCA he signed on January 20, 2004. In the\nremarks section of the question, Applicant stated, \u201cI believed it was voluntary until it was too late\nto register. I had a lack of knowledge and misunderstanding of the process. To my knowledge, I have\nalso not been notified of the non-voluntary aspects of the registration with the Selective Service.\u201d\n(Item 4) Applicant added a little detail in his answer to the SOR. He failed to register because he\nthought that registration was voluntary permitting him to join the military at any time. Additionally,\nhe claims he had not received any notice of the obligation to register. When he viewed the SSS\n\n4\nwebsite and learned that registration was a legal requirement, he was already 26 years old and his\nattempt to register was rejected. \nAn investigation by the SSS website (www.4.sss.gov/regver/verif_not_found.asp) disclosed\non January 31, 2007 (Item 6) that a registration record could not be found for Applicant. \nAn investigation of Applicant was made by the United States Air Force Office of Special\nInvestigations (AFOSI) that ended on October 14, 2004. The investigation (Item 7), conducted at the\nrequest of DOHA, consisted of record checks and interviews. A review of records of the air base\nfacility and surrounding area where Applicant was (and still is) employed, \u201cdisclosed no derogatory\ninformation regarding subject.\u201d All people interviewed recommended Applicant for a position of\ntrust. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see Directive E2.2.2.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure by any\nforeign interest. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\n Applicant\u2019s father no longer resides in Japan. \n1\n5\nConduct involving questionable judgment, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nands regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe FI guideline calls for a careful evaluation of whether an applicant may be manipulated\nor induced by his foreign contacts and/or financial interests to help a foreign entity in a way that is\nharmful to U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Applicant\u2019s\nmother, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law are resident citizens of Japan.  FI disqualifying condition\n1\n(DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies based on the\nforeign citizenship of Applicant\u2019s family members. FI DC 7d. (sharing living quarters with a person\nor persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies to his spouse and child being resident\ncitizens of Japan and sharing a residence with Applicant.\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, FI mitigating condition (MC) 8.a. (the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in\na position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.) may be potentially applicable. All of Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers identified in the SOR are resident citizens of Japan except for Applicant\u2019s father. However,\nnone of Applicant\u2019s family members are agents of any foreign government. His wife is a sales clerk\nin a candy store. His nine-year-old child is attending a private school. His mother is a 49-year-old\nretired homemaker. His father is 47 years old, a U.S. citizen, employed by the U.S. Department of\nDefense, and currently lives in the U.S., not Japan as alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law\nis a restaurant owner. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a 29-year-old cook in his mother-in-law\u2019s\nrestaurant. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is 32 years old and employed as a beautician. \nIn determining whether the listed family members create a heightened risk of manipulation\nor coercion, the type of government and foreign country must be evaluated. Japan is constitutional\nmonarchy with a parliamentary government, and a good human rights record. Though territorial\ndisputes and misunderstandings persist with a few regional neighbors, Japan continues to work with\nregional and worldwide organizations like the United Nations to resolve those disputes peacefully.\nThe country has been a strong ally of the U.S., and has provided significant support to the U.S. in\nthe world wide war on terror. Even though Japan is considered in the noticed material as an active\ncollector of economic and proprietary information, its good human rights record indicates that the\ncountry is less likely to manipulate or coerce its citizens in a way that could force Applicant to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign family member and the interests of the U.S.\n\n6\nFI MC 8.a. also mitigates Applicant\u2019s employment in Japan since 1992. Most of Applicant\u2019s\nemployers have been U.S. corporations. He is currently employed as a financial systems analyst by\na U.S. defense contractor whose facility is located on a U.S. military installation in Japan. He\nmaintains his only preference and allegiance is for the U.S. He also stated he would report any\nsuspicious contacts to the appropriate authorities. Even though his prediction on how he would act\nin the future to a particular set of circumstances does not actually mean he would follow through\nwith his predicted actions should those circumstances arise, his statements nonetheless, receive some\nfavorable weight. ISCR Case NO. 02-26826 (November 12, 2003) Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.\nare found for Applicant \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nThe Government argues that Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and his failure to register with the\nSelective Service make PC DC 16.c. (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports the whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating the person may not properly safeguard classified information)\napplicable to deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance application. Having weighed and balanced\nApplicant\u2019s remarks to question 18 of his SCA (Item 4) with his answer to the SOR, I do not find\nApplicant willfully failed to register with the SSS. \nIf prosecuted and convicted, a failure to register with the SSS, a blueprint for the U.S. to\ndevise and administer a draft for males between 18 and 26 years of age, can result in  criminal\npenalties of up to $250,000.00 fine and up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Over the years, registration\nwith the SSS has become a condition for receiving other types of Federal benefits such as student\naid, training, and Federal employment. This condition was imposed to persuade more eligible men\nto register. At the Federal level, a non-registrant may not be excluded from a benefit if he can show\nhis failure to register was not knowing and wilful. Many states make registration with the SSS a\nrequirement for receiving a state driver\u2019s license. It appears this requirement was applied to assure\nthat even greater numbers of draft-eligible men are registered with the SSS.\nHaving weighed and balanced Applicant\u2019s remarks under question 18 of his SCA with his\nanswer, I conclude Applicant mistakenly believed that because joining a branch of the service was\noptional, registering with the SSS was also optional. After learning that SSS registration was\nrequired by law, Applicant attempted to cure his act of omission by registering, but, having reached\nage 26, his registration attempt was rejected. Though not an excuse for not complying with the\nregistration law, a factor that still must be considered is Applicant was (and still is) residing and\nworking in Japan between the age of 19 and 26 (seven years of the time period in which an applicant\nis required to register), and therefore, not exposed to the extant triggering mechanisms at the state\nand Federal levels reminding eligible stateside males to register. \nThough Applicant\u2019s failure to register constitutes a serious lapse of judgment, his act of\nomission is mitigated under PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or\nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\n\n7\nThe failure to register is clearly not a minor offense because even a small number of omitted names\nfrom the Selective Service roster defeats the legislative objective of the SSS policy to devise and\nimplement the fairest and most equitable selection system in case a draft is reinstated. However,\nthere is no evidence of a pattern of similar behavior since 1999 (when Applicant finally made an\nunsuccessful attempt to register). Applicant has no criminal record and the persons interviewed by\nAFOSI have all recommended him for a position of trust. \nAfter weighing and balancing all the disqualifying conditions and evidence against the\nmitigating conditions and evidence, in the context of the whole person model, Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns associated with the FI guideline and the PC guideline. Subparagraphs\n1.a through 1.g., and subparagraph 2.a. are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nFor the Applicant. \nSubparagraph c.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph g.\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted. \n\n8\nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She currently works for a defense contractor as a computer\nscientist. In 1995, she married an American in the U.S. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\n2000. Her children were born in the U.S. and are not citizens of Israel. Her mother and three brothers\nare citizens and residents of Israel. Applicant visited Israel in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005,\nusing her Israeli passport. Recently, her Israeli passport was cancelled and is no longer valid.\nApplicant has mitigated the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns. Clearance\nis granted.\n\nEx. 1 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated November 18, 2005).\n1\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. 8.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 18, 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP).  On February 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\ndeclined to grant a security clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant,\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised AG  was provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement, on February 16, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 2, 2007. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 4, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 17, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for May 10, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing,\nthe Government offered one exhibit, Ex. 1. Applicant offered one exhibit, Ex. A. All exhibits were\nadmitted into the record without objection. Prior to the hearing, the Government requested that\nadministrative notice be taken of the content of eight documents about Israel. There being no\nobjection, administrative notice was taken of those facts. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May\n30, 2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\nPrior to the hearing, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the Statement of\nReasons. Pursuant to \u00b6 2 of the SOR, the Government moved to add an additional allegation as\nfollows:\n2.c  Your mother is a citizen of and resident in Israel.\nAt the hearing, Applicant did not object to \u00b6 2.c.  Accordingly, the SOR is amended as stated\n3\nabove.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d and 2.a\nthrough 2.c. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the factual\nallegation under subparagraph 1.a. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\n\nId. at 17.\n4\nId. at 19.\n5\nId.\n6\nId. at 18.\n7\nId.\n8\nId. at 21.\n9\nId. at. 22.\n10\nId.\n11\nId. at 23.\n12\nId. at 24.\n13\nId. at 21.\n14\nId. at 22.\n15\n4\nIn August 1986, Applicant received a master\u2019s degree from a university in Israel. Applicant\ncame to the U.S. in 1993, while on sabbatical leave.  She married an American citizen in 1995 in the\n4\nU.S.  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2000.  Their two children, now aged 10 and\n5\n6\n8, were born in the U.S.7\nApplicant is 50 and works for a defense contractor as a computer scientist since October\n2005.  Prior to that position, she worked for a defense contractor from November 2000 to October\n8\n2005 as a chief programmer/analyst. From March 1993 through November 2000, she worked as a\nchief programmer/analyst for another defense contractor.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Israel.  Applicant\u2019s mother is 78 years old.\n9\nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. Her parents are Holocaust survivors, and Israel provided refuge to\nthem.  Her mother owned a shoe store, and retired almost 20 years ago.  Applicant speaks to her\n10\n11\nmother by telephone at least once a week.  Her mother does not belong to, does not participate in,\n12\nand is not active with any government agency of Israel. Applicant respects her mother being a\nHolocaust survivor. She is not willing to renounce her Israeli heritage because it would hurt her\nmother\u2019s feelings.  \n13\nApplicant\u2019s three brothers are citizens and residents of Israel.  One of her brothers is an\n14\nartist, another is a chemist working for a pharmaceutical company, and the other is an electrical\nengineer.  She talks to her younger brother, the chemist, at least once a week to find out how the\n15\n\nId. at 23.\n16\nId.\n17\nId. at 22.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s Answer (dated February 16, 2007).\n19\nEx.

She talks to her other two brothers about four times a year.  Her brothers do not\n16\n17\nbelong to, do not participate in, and are not active with any government agency of Israel.18\nApplicant\u2019s U.S. passport was issued in June 2000. In 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005, she\ntraveled to Israel. She used her Israeli passport, as required by Israeli law, to enter and exit Israel,\nexercising dual citizenship. Applicant denies this allegation. She stated: \nI have not exercised dual citizenship since I have no intention in holding or keeping\nIsraeli citizenship, which is not up to me, but is up to the Israeli authorities. I have,\non the contrary, actively pursued United States citizenship.19\nAfter the 2005 trip, Applicant deposited her Israeli passport at the Embassy of Israel, where\nit was secured until she requested it for her next trip. She presented her U.S. passport for entry and\nexit when she traveled to other countries. \nOn May 2, 2007, Applicant received a letter from the Embassy of Israel, confirming that her\nIsraeli passport has been cancelled and is no longer valid.  The passport was cut in half and returned\n20\nto Applicant. She will now use her American passport when entering and exiting Israel.\nApplicant has strong ties to America. Her husband was born in America, as were their two\nchildren. She owns real estate here, she has bank and retirement accounts, her children attend public\nschool and are in the boy and girl scouts. She votes in U.S. elections. She has a profession that she\nexcels in and enjoys. Applicant has no foreign property or foreign investments.21\nI take administrative notice that Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, must enter and\ndepart Israel on their Israeli passports, and Israeli authorities may require persons whom they\nconsider to have acquired Israeli nationality at birth to obtain an Israeli passport prior to departing\nIsrael, even if said persons neither are aware of the nationality nor have any desire to maintain it.22\nSince 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close friendship based on common\ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. Israel has an active program to gather\nproprietary information with the United States. These collection activities are primarily directed at\n\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), Intelligence Threat Handbook, June 2004, excerpts, including IOSS\n23\nbackground information.\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n24\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n24\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n25\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n26\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.27\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.28\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n29\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n30\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\n\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n31\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n32\n6\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n31\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n32\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nForeign Preference\nUnder Guideline C, a security risk may exist when an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nApplicant has U.S. citizenship by naturalization. Since 2000, she possessed an active U.S.\npassport. Applicant traveled to Israel in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005, and used her Israeli\npassport to comply with the requirement of her Israeli nationality, thus exercising dual citizenship. Her\npossession and use of a foreign passport permitted her to exercise the rights and privileges of foreign\ncitizenship and indicated a preference for Israel to the U.S. Thus, Foreign Preference Disqualifying\nCondition \u00b6 10(a) (conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen\nor through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (a)\npossession of a current foreign passport) applies. \nVarious factors can mitigate the foreign preference security concerns. Applicant\u2019s dual\ncitizenship is based on her parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country. Her Israeli passport has\nrecently been cancelled and is no longer valid. Consequently, Foreign Preference Mitigating\nConditions \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry) and \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority,\nor otherwise invalidated) apply. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are concluded\nin favor of Applicant.\nForeign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist for an individual with divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests. The person may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or a government in a way that is not in the interests of the U.S., or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s mother and three brothers are residents and citizens of Israel. Moreover, she has\na niece and two close friends who are also residents and citizens of Israel. She has visited her family\nand friends in Israel at least five times between 1998 and 2005. Thus, the Israeli citizenship and\nresidency of Applicant\u2019s family and friends create the potential for a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant\npotentially vulnerable to coercision, exploitation, or pressure. Consequently, Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Conditions \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\nand \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information)\napply.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The most important\nmitigating factor is Applicant herself and her total commitment to the U.S. through her employment\nwith major defense contractors for the past 10 years. She married an American and they have a home\nin the U.S. Moreover, their children were born here, and she has not sought dual citizenship for them\nin Israel. None of her relatives living in Israel pose a potential security threat or are in a position likely\nto be influenced by the Israeli government. None of them work for the Israeli government or are\ninvolved in work that might create security issues for the U.S. Israel is a country where there is a\nheightened risk because of their active intelligence gathering activities aimed at the U.S. Thus, Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Condition\u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.)\napplies. \nAlthough Applicant has traveled to Israel five times between 1998 and 2005, she has\nknowledge of security requirements. Applicant can be relied on to take whatever steps are necessary\nto eliminate any possible risk when she travels to Israel. Moreover, Applicant has deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. and she can be expected to resolve any conflict\nin favor o the U.S. Thus, \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) applies. Accordingly,\nallegations 2.a through 2.c of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Looking at the whole person, Applicant presents a highly credible case that she would not be\ninfluenced by anything contrary to the best interests of the U.S. Her residence in the U.S. for more than\n14 years, her marriage to an American and their children born in the U.S., her career record with\nseveral major defense contractors for more than 10 years effectively refute the risk that she would now\ntake any action that would jeopardize U.S. security interests. She has assimilated into U.S. customs\nand culture and continues to embrace the U.S. as her home. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\n\n8\npotential security concerns arising from her personal ties to Israel. I find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a clearance to Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2.

His financial considerations, personal conduct, and\ncriminal conduct concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified and revised.  The\n1\nSOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal\nConduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a notarized answer, dated February 2, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record. On March 29, 2007,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing ten Items, and\nmailed it to Applicant.  On April 12, 2007, Applicant received the FORM and had 30 days from\nits receipt to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He\nchose not to submit any additional information.  The case was assigned to me on June 14, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 29 years old and single. Since June 2005, he has worked as a\nshipping/receiving clerk for a federal contractor.  After graduating from high school in June\n1995, he held various jobs and was unemployed for extended periods of time. (Item 3). In June\n2005, he submitted a SF-86 security questionnaire and subsequently submitted an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on November 8, 2006,\n\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nApplicant admitted that the following judgment and debts listed in the SOR, totaling\n$6,319, remain unpaid: \u00b6 1.a for $1,852.29 (judgment); \u00b6 1.c for $1,692; \u00b6 1.d for $1,076; and \u00b6\n1.e for $888. He denied that he owed the tax lien listed in \u00b6 1.b for $100. According to Item 9,\nthat debt was paid in December 2000. In his answer, he indicated that he paid off a $3,000 debt\nand is in the process of paying others. (Item 2).  He attributed his financial problems to the use of\ncredit cards and immaturity from the age of 17 to 22. (Id.; Item 5).  The judgment was entered in\n1999. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant failed to disclose, under question 38 of his SF 86, the\ndebts listed in \u00b6 1.a through \u00b6 1.e that were more than 180 days delinquent.  SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges\nthat he failed to disclose, under question 39, the same debts that were 90 days delinquent. In his\nanswer he admitted that he falsified the application \u201cbecause of the embarrassing nature of this\nmatter.\u201d (Item 2). He accepts full responsibility for his conduct. (Id.). In his June 2006 meeting\nwith an investigator about his answers to the SF 86, he explained that he did not report the\nfinancial problems because he completed the SF 86 the first day of his employment and was\n\u201cafraid the employer would see the information and not hire him.\u201d (Item 3 at 5).  When he\ncompleted the e-QIP in November 2006, he again failed to list his delinquent debts. (Item 5 at\n24). \nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must\nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation\u201d (Guidelines), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6\n2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to\n2\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.\nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area\nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n3\nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s]\nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2\n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nnational security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.  The\n2\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the\nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides,\n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends\nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special\nrelationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\n \n\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision\nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order\n10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the\nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Guideline \u00b6 19(a) and (c).  \nApplicant essentially admitted he was responsible for a judgment and four delinquent\ndebts listed in the SOR. He claimed he paid an old debt (not listed in the SOR) and intends to\nresolve the remaining unpaid ones. The debts span an eight year period of time, some being\ndelinquent for several years. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two FC DCs, and the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Five Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guideline \u00b6 20(a)-(e) are potentially\napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude none of the\nmitigating conditions apply. Because the debts are not isolated, are ongoing and current, they\ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability and good judgment and are not mitigated under Guideline \u00b6\n20(a). Applicant attributed the financial problems to his immaturity and not conditions beyond\nhis control, which eliminates the application of Guideline \u00b6 20(b). There is no evidence that he\nobtained credit counseling, which is required under Guideline \u00b6 20(c).  Other than resolving the\n$100 state lien, Applicant did not produce any evidence that he has taken actions to address the\nremaining debts, which would support the application of Guideline \u00b6 20(d). Guideline \u00b6 20(e) is\nnot applicable because he did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to any of the unpaid\ndebts listed in the SOR. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving . . . lack of candor [or] dishonesty . . . can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process . . . .\u201d One Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly\nrelevant and may be disqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides a disqualification when\nthere is a \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 had incorrect answers to questions 38 and 39; his e-QIP had incorrect\nanswers to question 28. Applicant admitted that he intentionally falsified the answers by not\nincluding the judgment and debts. He claimed he did not disclose them because he was\nembarrassed. Based on that admission, the Government established a Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition under Guideline \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \nAfter reviewing all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions, in particular Guideline\n\u00b6 17(a), I conclude it does not apply. Under that Guideline, a disqualification can be mitigated if\nthere is evidence that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\n\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d In this instance, Applicant\ndid not correct the omission until he was confronted with the problem during an interview with an\ninvestigator in June 2006, and again failed to list them on the e-QIP he completed subsequently.\nNone of the other conditions are applicable based on the evidence.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 30 \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions that he knowingly falsified two answers on his security\nclearance application, the Government established the Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition\nunder Guideline \u00b6 31(c): \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Those admissions constitute a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which makes a false statement on a security clearance application a\ncrime under federal law, punishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. \nUnder Guideline \u00b6 32, three Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions are potentially\napplicable:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures \nare no longer present in the person\u2019s life; and\n(c) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nAfter evaluating the record evidence as a whole, I conclude none of the above three apply.\nGuideline \u00b6 32(a) does not apply because the falsification initially occurred in June 2005 when\nApplicant completed his first SF 86 and then again in November 2006 when he submitted the e-\nQIP.  Less than one year has elapsed since the November 2006 incident, which is not enough time.\nHe voluntarily falsified the answers, such that Guideline \u00b6 32(b) is not applicable.  Although he\ntakes full responsibility for his actions, that acknowledgement alone is insufficient to establish\nrehabilitation under Guideline \u00b6 32(c).  \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered\nthe general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nAlthough Applicant resolved one small SOR debt and indicated that he intends to pay the others,\nall of the other debts remain outstanding and unresolved, which is serious enough to raise a\nsecurity concern. His financial decisions to incur debt that he has been unable to repay were\nvoluntary acts, albeit immature at the time. He is now 29 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully\n\nresponsible for his obligations. Without an established budget for repayment and track record of\nconsistent financial management and discipline, demonstrating reliability and good judgment, I am\nconcerned that these financial problems will continue, despite his assertions that he intends to pay\nall of his debts.\nWhile one can appreciate the embarrassment Applicant may have felt over his debts when\nhe completed the SF 86 on his first day of work, it was not an excuse for failing to truthfully\ndisclose his debts in the November 2006 e-QIP, which he completed after his interview with the\ninvestigator. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all facts and circumstances,\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining\nto financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal conduct. For the reasons stated, I\nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information at this time.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c-f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and b:\nAgainst Applicant\n    Paragraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a 20-plus year history of engaging in Peeping Tom activities, although it ended\nin about 1997. He admits he has an addiction to Internet pornography. In March 2003, he was fired\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nfrom his job when he accessed and viewed adult pornography on a company computer. Eligibility\nfor a security clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nFebruary 1, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline D for sexual behavior and\nGuideline E for personal conduct. Applicant timely replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated February 1, 2007. This matter was noted on\nthe record at the start of the hearing (R. 15).\nThe case was assigned to me March 29, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the\nhearing for April 24, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript May 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s written answer to the SOR allegations was mixed. He admitted the allegations\nin SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, and he denied the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e,\nand 2.a. Based on his hearing testimony, his answer was amended to admit SOR subparagraphs 1.b\nand 1.e (R. 39\u201340, 54\u201355). His admissions are incorporated herein. I make the following findings\nof fact set forth below. \n\n3\n1.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old security officer for a company that provides security services. He\nhas worked for this company since July 2004. According to his current manager, Applicant has been\nthe \u201cproverbial straight arrow\u201d at work (Exhibit A). His manager views Applicant as a person of high\ncharacter, ethics, and behavior, and that he is one of the most responsible security officers on the\nteam.  \n2.\nTo obtain an industrial security clearance for his current employment, Applicant completed\na security-clearance application in November 2005 (Exhibit 1). In response to Question 22 about his\nemployment record, he disclosed that in March 2003 he was fired from his job as a film inspector\nfor an information-solutions company. \n3.\nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes a 20-year period of military service in the U.S. Air\nForce. He enlisted in September 1975, and was promoted up the ranks to tech sergeant (pay grade\nE-6). Initially, he was trained in the field of aircraft refueling. He was then trained and worked in the\nfield of weather observing and forecasting. He was working as a weather forecaster when he retired\nin September 1995. While in the Air Force, he  held a security clearance at the secret and top-secret\nlevels. \n4.\nAbout two months later, Applicant started working as a film inspector and did so until he was\nterminated in March 2003. Sometime in 2002, Applicant realized he was being drawn to viewing\nadult pornography via the Internet while at work. He accessed pornography two to three times per\nweek, and he would sometimes spend a couple of hours looking at the material (R. 35). Applicant\nwent to his supervisor and asked to be banned from the Internet at work. Nevertheless, Applicant\nwent on to use a company computer to view adult pornography on the Internet. His actions were\ndiscovered by another employee, and the company determined that Applicant had accessed the\nmaterial. The company referred Applicant to their employee-assistance program (EAP) in lieu of\nterminating him for violating company rules.\n5.\nApplicant attended about six counseling sessions with a counselor through the EAP program.\nHe then requested to change to a Christian counselor. He established a patient\u2013counselor relationship\nwith a licensed mental-health practitioner/certified counselor. \n6.\nIn March 2003, Applicant relapsed when he viewed adult pornographic material by using a\ncompany computer during work. He admitted the conduct to management and he was fired the same\nday. The resulting period of unemployment caused Applicant other problems, including a home\nforeclosure when he was unable to keep up with the required mortgage payments.\n7.\nFrom about January 2003 to about August 2006, Applicant received treatment from a medical\ndoctor engaged in the general practice of medicine, sometimes called a family practitioner. During\nthis time, Applicant was diagnosed as dysthmia with compulsive behavior, i.e., pornography.\nDysthmia disorder is a mood disorder, the essential feature of which is a chronically depressed mood\nthat occurs for most of the day more days than not for at least two years (Exhibit 2). As a result,\nApplicant was prescribed various medications, and he is currently taking Zoloft (R. 46). It is\ncommonly prescribed for depression (Exhibit 3).\n8.\nIn addition to the counseling in 2002\u20132003, Applicant has continued to see the same mental-\nhealth practitioner, and does so currently at a frequency of about twice a month. The mental-health\n\n According to the dictionary, Peeping Tom was a legendary citizen of Coventry who watched Lady Godiva\n3\nriding naked. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 855 (10  ed., 2002). The term is commonly understood to mean\nth\nvoyeurism. \n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n4\npractitioner testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf at the hearing. Her educational background includes a\nmaster\u2019s degree in counseling. That was followed by a two-year internship and a licensing\nexamination. She has been a licensed mental-health practitioner since 2001, and she is also a\ncertified professional counselor. Her treatment plan for Applicant involves talk therapy. She has seen\na dramatic change or improvement in Applicant during the counseling. In her opinion, Applicant\u2019s\ndepression is in remission and his addiction to Internet pornography is in recovery (meaning he is\nnot participating). Her current treatment plan for Applicant will continue to be talk therapy about\nevery two weeks or so. Her prognosis for Applicant for both the depression and the addiction to\npornography is very good (R. 85). She is of the opinion that Applicant has developed coping skills\nto control his addiction that he previously did not have (R. 80). \n9.\nIn addition to the Internet pornography, Applicant has a 20-plus year history of engaging in\nPeeping Tom  activities. It started when he was in his teens. It continued during his 20 years of\n3\nmilitary service. It tapered off after he retired from the Air Force in 1995, and Applicant believes it\nended sometime around 1997. During this period, Applicant estimates he engaged in Peeping\nTomism about once or twice a week. He was never caught or apprehended. He disclosed these\nmatters when he went into counseling for his addiction to Internet pornography. \n10.\nApplicant has engaged in no workplace misconduct at his current employer, including\nviewing Internet pornography while at work. On occasion, Applicant views Internet pornography in\nprivate. On average, he does so once a week or less (R. 51). And that has taken place as recently as\nwithin the past month. \nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n10\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n5\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n10\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n11\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline D of the Revised Guidelines, sexual behavior that involves a criminal\noffense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, reflects a lack of judgment or discretion, or\nwhich may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. No adverse inference may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the\nindividual. \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of sexual behavior. His 20-plus year history of Peeping Tomism and his workplace\nmisconduct by accessing and viewing Internet pornography constitute a well-established history of\nsexual behavior that calls into question his security suitability. Of particular concern is his addiction\nto Internet pornography, which appears to be a serious and ongoing long-term problem. I reviewed\nthe DC under the guideline  and conclude several apply. Each DC is briefly summarized and\ndiscussed below.\n\n6\nThe first DC\u2014sexual behavior of a criminal nature\u2014applies in part. Applicant\u2019s  Peeping\nTomism was criminal in nature, regardless that neither civil nor military authorities arrested,\ncharged, or prosecuted Applicant.\nThe second DC\u2014a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual\nbehavior\u2014applies. Both his Peeping Tomism and his addiction to Internet pornography were\ningrained patterns of behavior as opposed to an isolated incident or aberrational behavior. Both\nactivities were compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk behavior that Applicant was unable to stop\nat the time. His Peeping Tomism was high-risk behavior because he put himself in jeopardy of\ncriminal sanctions if caught. His Internet addiction to pornography was self-destructive, as\ndemonstrated by his job termination in 2003 followed by a period of unemployment and financial\nproblems. \n \nThe third DC\u2014sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u2014does not apply. Although this may have been a concern in the past, it is not\na current concern given that Applicant has disclosed these matters through his counseling and to the\ngovernment through the security-clearance process. The likelihood of Applicant\u2019s history of sexual\nbehavior being used against him to \u201ccause\u201d him to be vulnerable in a security context is relatively\nremote and unlikely.\nThe fourth DC\u2014sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects a lack of discretion\nor judgment\u2014applies. Both his Peeping Tomism and using the Internet at work to view pornography\nreflect a gross lack of discretion or judgment. This is especially so considering Applicant\u2019s multiple\nviolations of company rules that led to his termination in 2003. \nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude he receives credit in mitigation. Each\nMC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior occurred before or during adolescence and there is no evidence\nof subsequent conduct of a similar nature\u2014does not apply. Although his Peeping Tomism started\nwhen he was a teenager, the record evidence is that the sexual behavior under review is not limited\nto his adolescence. His Peeping Tomism continued for years until about 1997, and his Internet\naddiction to pornography was a more recent development and continues. \nThe second MC\u2014the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. His behavior was recent, as shown\nby his termination in March 2003, which is less than five years ago. His behavior was frequent, as\nshown by the once a week Peeping Tomism. And his sexual behavior was not an aberrational or\nsituational event.\nThe third MC\u2014the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress\u2014applies. As discussed above, the likelihood of Applicant\u2019s history of sexual behavior being\nused against him to \u201ccause\u201d him to be vulnerable in a security context is relatively remote and\nunlikely.\nThe fourth MC\u2014the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet\u2014is\ninapplicable to this case.\n\n The allegation in SOR subparagraph 2.a is merely a cross-reference to the allegations in SOR subparagraphs\n12\n1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. In my view, an analysis of these matters under Guideline E does not result in any additional or\nindependent security concerns. Because these matters are explicitly covered under Guideline D and are sufficient for an\nadverse determination under Guideline D, it is unnecessary to rehash it a second time. For these reasons, Guideline E\nis decided for Applicant. \n7\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is 51 years\nold, and he was an adult for the vast majority of the time he engaged in the sexual behavior under\nreview. In addition to the MC discussed above, Applicant receives credit in mitigation for his\nwillingness to participate in counseling in the past and for his current counseling program. After\nhaving a chance to listen to and observe him discuss his situation, I was impressed by his insight into\nhis behavior and his efforts to overcome his problems. \nOf concern is the seriousness of his addiction to Internet pornography and the recency of the\nworkplace misconduct that led to his termination in March 2003. When he was working as a film\ninspector, he used the company computer to access and view Internet pornography as frequently as\ntwo to three times weekly, and he spent considerable time doing so. He was caught and required to\nobtain counseling or be fired. But he was unable to stay away, which eventually led to his\ntermination. His workplace misconduct is not ancient history, as it took place less than five years\nago. Although he has not accessed Internet pornography in his current employment, he has done so\nin private. His continued viewing of Internet pornography in private means that it is possible that he\ncould relapse at the workplace. This circumstance, coupled with his current counselor\u2019s unawareness\nof his recent viewing of Internet pornography in private, lessen the weight that I give to the\ncounselor\u2019s favorable prognosis. All these circumstances militate against a favorable decision for\nApplicant. \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has not\npresented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Likewise,\nhe has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline D:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant12\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid P. Price, Attorney At Law\nSYNOPSIS\n  \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement, alcohol abuse, dishonesty and criminal conduct\nconsidered in totality have not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.\nClearance is denied.  \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 21, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on April 5, 2007.  The case was reassigned to a second Administrative Judge\non April 9, 2007.  It was then transferred to the undersigned Administrative Judge on June 14, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on May 4, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 19, 2007.  At the\nhearing the Government called one witness and presented two exhibits of which only one was\nadmitted into evidence.  The Applicant called three witnesses and presented three exhibits.  The\nApplicant also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until June 25, 2007, to allow\nthe Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant presented one Post-\nHearing exhibit that was admitted into evidence.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June\n27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 31 years old and single.  He holds a Bachelors of Science degree.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as an Senior GIS Analyst and Manager,  and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Appellant was a rebellious teenager.  In 1998, while in high school, he started using\nmarijuana on a regular basis since it was commonly used among his friends.  His use of marijuana\ncontinued into college but became less frequent than in high school and mainly at social gatherings.\nThe Applicant testified that he last used marijuana in about June 1999, around the time he graduated\nfrom college.  (Tr. p.127).  The federal investigator who conducted a personal interview of the\nApplicant, and who took notes and prepared a report of investigation from his notes, testified\nconcerning his interview of the Applicant.  The investigator stated that the Applicant told him that\nhe had actually used marijuana over a greater period of time than he had listed on the application.\n(Tr. p. 35).        \nThe Applicant testified that he used cocaine in 1998 and/or 1999, during his junior or senior\nyear in college and has not used it since.  He also testified that he contributed to a group purchase\nof cocaine.  He explained that his use of cocaine was infrequent and that he could not remember\nexactly how many times he used it because he was usually consuming alcohol at the time and his\nmemory is very foggy.  (Tr. p. 154).  When the Applicant was questioned at the hearing as to what\n\n3\nhe told the investigator about his cocaine usage, the Applicant stated that he did not recall exactly.\n(Tr. p. 155).  \nThe federal investigator who interviewed the Applicant testified that the Applicant\nvoluntarily told him that he had used cocaine and that he had purchased it.  He also told him that he\nhad not used cocaine that often, but that it had been until fairly recently as opposed to the marijuana\nusage which was all far in the past.   The investigator testified, \u201cThat he started using the cocaine or\nhad first used it roughly about the same time, about the time that he had stopped using marijuana and\nthat it had continued up until about 2004.\u201d  (Tr. pp. 46- 47).  \nThe Applicant admits that he used LSD in 1994 or 1995, during college, and purchased it on\nat least one occasion.  The Applicant contends that he has not used any illegal drugs since graduating\nfrom college.  (Tr. p. 127).  The federal investigator testified that the Applicant told him that he had\npurchased what he believed was LSD, but he did not know for a fact if it was LSD.\nThe Applicant was arrested on three occasions for drug related offenses.  In September 1991\nhe was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana.  He was held overnight and then released\nto his parents.  He received deferred adjudication and was fined less than $200.00.  A month later,\nhe was arrested again for Possession of Marijuana.  He was held a few hours and then released.  He\nreceived a deferred adjudication and was fined less than $200.00.  \nIn August 1995, the Applicant was detained while attempting to cross the Canadian border.\nHis car was searched by the Canadian police and LSD was discovered in the Applicant\u2019s backpack.\nHe was arrested and held in a Canadian jail overnight.\nIn August 2004, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana.  He\nwas held overnight and released.  He subsequently paid a fine for this offense.\nThe Applicant indicates that he has no intention of ever using any illegal drug again.  (Tr. p.\n136).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant also abused alcohol,  at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from\napproximately 1993 to at least March 2006.  \nIn September 1994, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Public Intoxication after he\nwas spotted by the police under the influence of alcohol urinating in public.  He was held overnight\nin jail and released.  At the time of the offense, the Applicant was in his first semester of college and\nhad been at a party where he had consumed several drinks.  He was relieving himself in the parking\nlot when he was arrested by campus police officers.  \nTen years later, the Applicant was arrested on January 31, 2004, and charged with (1) Driving\nWithout Lights On, (2) Driving While Intoxicated, (3) Driving With an Open Container of Beer, and\n(4) Obstruction of a Highway Passageway.  The Applicant was found guilty of Count 4, sentenced\nto 120 days in jail, suspended, fined $500.00, court costs of $239.00 and other fees of $820.00,\nordered to perform 40 hours of community service and was were placed on 16 months of community\n\n4\nsupervision/probation.  The Applicant explained that he was at a birthday party with some coworkers\nand had consumed four or five cocktails before driving.  He left the gathering and pulled into a gas\nstation to get gas.  He turned his lights off and forgot to turn them back on when he left.  A police\nofficer pulled him over for not having his lights on and smelled alcohol on his breath.  The Applicant\nwas given a field sobriety test and was determined too drunk to drive.    \nThe Applicant generally consumes alcohol on the weekends.  (Tr.p. 140).  He lives alone and\nduring the week his alcohol consumption is minimal.  He enjoys going out with friends on Friday\nand Saturday nights and having a couple of drinks.  He is very cautious and careful about how much\nalcohol he consumes and how long its been since his last drink.  (Tr.p. 141).  \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his personal background\nduring the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)\ndated September 19, 2005.  Question 24(a) of the application asked the Applicant if since the age\nof 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, has he illegally used any controlled substance.  The\nApplicant answered, \u201cYES\u201d and listed that he used marijuana six times from September 1998 to June\n1999.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  He did not list his cocaine use in any manner or form what so\never.  The evidence indicates that he used cocaine from 1998 to at least 2004.    \n  \nBased upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified his security\nclearance application when he failed to list his use of cocaine from 1999 to 2004.  \nParagraph 4 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications on his security clearance application, discussed\nabove, are a violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.\nMitigation.\nThree witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant including his mother, his Manager-\nSupervisor, who hired him, and a professional associate.  They collectively consider the Applicant\nto be honest, responsible and trustworthy.  He is further described as hardworking, down-to-earth\nand open-minded.  He can be relied upon to get the job done at work without problems of any kind.\nHis mother explained that as a teenager, the Applicant experienced some troubling times, but as time\npassed, he grew out of it and became much more mature.  She and her husband are very proud of the\nApplicant and his accomplishments.   \nFive letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant all attest to his hard\nworking, honest, responsible, pleasant and positive attitude.  He is a dedicated employee that\ndemonstrates high quality work and shows outstanding leadership skills.  He is respected by his\ncolleagues and professional associates.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit). \n\n5\nSeveral Certificates of Achievement and commendations for successful work completion\nwere submitted on behalf of the Applicant.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern.  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale\nor distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\n22.(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n\n6\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n30.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n30.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n7\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in alcohol abuse, dishonesty\nand criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in drug involvement (Guideline H); alcohol abuse (Guideline G); dishonesty (Guideline E)\nand criminal conduct (Guideline J).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of\n\n8\nthe Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance\neligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under\nGuidelines H, G, E and J of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, disqualifying conditions, 25(a) any drug abuse and\n25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution or possession of drug paraphernalia apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable.\nThe Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement involved three drug related arrests, and began\nin about 1998 with the use and purchase of marijuana, cocaine and LSD and continued until at least\n2004.  Given the vast discrepancy in the Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing and the information\nhe provided to the federal investigator during the interview, I cannot find that the Applicant is\ncredible when he states that he stopped using cocaine in 1999.  I am more apt to believe that what\nhe told the investigator during his personal interview is more accurate.  The investigator has nothing\nto gain by providing false statements and is sworn to tell the truth at all times.  The investigator\ntestified that the Applicant told him that he used cocaine until 2004.  Under the particular facts of\nthis case, I really do not know when the Applicant stopped using cocaine, but I believe that he\ncontinued to use it beyond 1999, and most probably used it until at least 2004.  Furthermore, the\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor during his testimony appeared uncertain, uncomfortable, agitated and nervous.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.      \nUnder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, disqualifying conditions, 22(a) alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent and 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent apply.  I have considered mitigating condition 23(a)., and\ndecide that it does not apply because viewed in its entirely his conduct does cast doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  Accordingly, none of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable.\nThe Applicant admitted that his excessive use of alcohol occurred during the same period that\nhe was abusing drugs.   His alcohol abuse also resulted in two alcohol related arrests, the first\noccurring in 1994, and the second ten years later in 2004.  Ironically, his second alcohol related arrest\noccurred the same year he last used cocaine.  He continues to consume alcohol and enjoys going out\non the weekends with his friends for cocktails.  I do not see a changed pattern of conduct that would\nguarantee prevention of this sort of abuse in the future.  His history of excessive alcohol abuse\ncombined with his illegal drug involvement has not been mitigated by sufficient rehabilitation and\nreform.  Accordingly, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption is found against the Applicant. \nIn response to Question 24 on his electronic security clearance application, the Applicant\ndeliberately falsified his security clearance application. There is no reasonable excuse as to why he\ndid not tell the truth about his drug involvement, other than the fact that he wanted to minimize it.\n\n9\nIt is obvious that he intentionally concealed this information from the Government, hoping to\nminimize the seriousness of the matter.  In doing so, he has violated Title 18 of the United States\nCodes, Section 1001, which is a felony.  Consequently, his dishonesty with the Government\nconcerning this matter is unacceptable.  Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying\ncondition 16(a), deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  Under Criminal\nConduct, disqualifying conditions 30(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses and 30(c)\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted apply.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and\nhonesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his personal\nbackground.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under Guidelines E or J apply.\n  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct\nset forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor , unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \n This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement), G (Alcohol Consumption), E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal\nConduct).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against\nthe Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4\nof the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g .:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n10\n    Subpara.  1.i .:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 4: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  4.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 60 years old, unmarried, and has a Bachelors of Science Degree in Production Technology/Industrial Management. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Manager of Quality Engineering and is seeking to obtain her security clearance in connection with her employment.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent financial indebtedness has not been resolved.  Her omission on her\nsecurity clearance application concerning her financial indebtedness was intentional and has not been\nmitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 7, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on June 22, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on July 5, 2007, scheduling the hearing for July 30, 2007.  At the\nhearing the Government presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant presented no exhibits but testified\non her own behalf.  The record was left open for ten days after the hearing, until the close of business\non August 9, 2007, to give the Applicant an opportunity to submit supporting documentation.  The\nApplicant submitted three Post-Hearing Exhibits, consisting of five pages,  referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibits A through C.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 60 years old, unmarried, and has a Bachelors of Science Degree in\nProduction Technology/Industrial Management.   She is employed by a defense contractor as a\nManager of Quality Engineering and is seeking to obtain her security clearance in connection with\nher employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nThe Applicant is indebted to sixteen different creditors for a total of at least $38,600.00. (See\nGovernment Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).  Since 1997, the Applicant has demonstrated poor financial\ndecisions that have resulted in a tax lien, a judgment, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997, and a Chapter\n13 bankruptcy that was filed in November 2006.     \nThe Applicant contends that for many years she has battled the problem of having multiple\nerrors on her credit reports.  She testified that all along she has tried to keep her credit in good\nstanding.  She says that she has made many attempts over the years, writing the credit bureaus in an\neffort to clean up her credit reports.  She finds that for a while her credit report is in good standing\n\n3\nand then she later discovers that the debt that was at one time removed is once again reflected as\ndelinquent on her report.  She believes that because her twin brother\u2019s name is spelled similarly and\nhis wife often used the Applicant\u2019s name for purposes of credit, their credit was mixed up with the\nApplicant\u2019s.  \nWith regard to the debts listed in the SOR, the Applicant admits the debts listed in 1(f), 1(o),\n1(p), 1(s), and 1(t) and denies the others.  She testified that the others are either not her debts, or\nshould not be reflected as outstanding as they are currently being paid through her Chapter 13\nbankruptcy.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing A).    \nIn 1997, the Applicant was forced to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy because she was laid off from\nher job and was unable to find suitable employment to cover her expenses.  When she did start\nworking, she did not pay enough in taxes and a tax lien was entered against her in 1997. \nIn 2002, the Applicant received notice that she had outstanding taxes due in the amount of\n$17,000.00 or $18,000,00 including late fees.  She made an arrangement with the Internal Revenue\nService and started paying them $400.00 monthly toward her back taxes.  When she filed for Chapter\n13 in 2006, she rolled this payment into her payment plan with the trustee.\nThe Applicant has also co-signed for a car for her daughter.  Her daughter sold the car to\nsomeone else, who essentially took over the payments for a while.  He stopped making payments and\nthe car was subsequently repossessed in 2003.  The Applicant is now responsible for this debt.\nIn January 2006, the Applicant purchased a house and at that time she believes that her credit\nwas in good standing because she was able to get the loan.  By August 2006, foreclosure proceedings\nhad been started.  (Tr. p. 73).  She testified that she had counted on obtaining a home improvement\nloan to pay for her landscaping expenses, however she was unable to get it.  She had to use money\nthat she did not have to pay for her backyard in the amount of $6,000.00.  It was about this time that\nher brother passed away, and she paid for his funeral expenses in the amount of about $4,000.00.\nShe also received notice that she owed some unexpected property taxes in the amount of $9,000.00,\nthat had to be paid.  \nBy November 2006, the Applicant had became so indebted she knew that she had to do\nsomething about it.  She filed for Chapter 13 and is now in the process of paying her debts through\na payment plan arranged and agreed upon between herself and the court trustee.  (See Government\nExhibit 6).  Since January 2007, the Applicant has been making monthly payments to the trustee in\nthe amount of $1,679.00 by cashiers check which is required under the plan for 60 months.  (Tr. p.\n90).  The Applicant is planning on refinancing her house in November 2007,  at which time she plans\nto get out of bankruptcy by paying off her creditors.  (Tr. p. 90).\nAlthough she is earning over $100,000.00 annually, after paying the court trustee under the\nBankruptcy plan and her other monthly expenses, the Applicant does not have much money left over.\nShe indicates that she is fortunate to receive travel per diem from her employer which has been\nhelpful in paying for food and other miscellaneous expenses.      \n\n4\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material aspects of her personal\nbackground during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP),\notherwise known as a security clearance questionnaire dated August 18, 2005.  Question 27(d) asked\nif in the last 7 years, has she had any judgments against her that have not been paid.  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  The Applicant testified that she did not believe that\nshe had any judgments against her at the time.  There is no evidence that she had any judgments\nwithin 7 years.  \nQuestion 28, of the same questionnaire asked her if in the last seven years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debts.   The Applicant answered \u201cNO.\u201d  (See Government Exhibit\n1).  This was not an accurate response.  The Applicant explained that at the time she completed the\napplication she believed that her credit was in good standing and that she was not over 180 days\ndelinquent on any of her debts.  This obviously could not be true based upon the Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcy records. \n   \nWith the number of delinquent debts the Applicant had in 2005, and considering her past\nfinancial history, there is no explanation as to why she did not answer question 28 correctly, other\nthan the fact that she intentionally sought to falsify her security clearance questionnaire.  She knew\nor should have known about her extensive financial delinquencies and should have revealed them\non her security clearance application.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant did deliberately fail to\nlist her delinquent financial history on her security clearance application.  Accordingly, I find that\nthe Applicant did deliberately attempt to conceal this information from the Government.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n\n5\n19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration, and/or other financial\nanalysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n6\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial\nirresponsibility or dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\n\n7\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F) and falsified her security clearance application (Guideline E).\nThis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With\nrespect to her finances, the Applicant history of poor financial management and the fact that she is\ncurrently in her second Bankruptcy in less than ten years, demonstrates that she is not financially\nresponsible.  Many of her debts remain outstanding and delinquent, as she has only been paying her\ndebts under the current Bankruptcy plan for eight months.  She has made some effort to resolve her\nindebtedness, however there is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.  Furthermore, the Applicant\nhas not demonstrated that she can properly handle her financial affairs.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; 19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ration, and/or other financial analysis apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nThe Applicant deliberately failed to reveal her delinquent financial history in response to\nquestion 28 on her security clearance application.  With respect to Guideline E, (Personal Conduct),\nDisqualifying Condition 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None\nof the mitigating conditions apply.  Accordingly Guideline E, except allegation 2(a),  is found against\nthe Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against\nthe Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 for the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1 b:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1 c:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1d:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1e:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1f:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1g:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1h:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1 i:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1k:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p:\n Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t:\n Against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2  Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Substantial Federal and state tax liens\nwere satisfied several years ago.  Other delinquent debts have been substantially paid off.\nApplicant is seeking to identify the current holders of the remaining debts and to promptly pay\nthem once that is done.  His current financial situation is strong and he should have no\nproblem doing so.  Mitigation has been adequately established.  Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The\nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied\nor revoked.\nOn March 8, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case\nwas originally assigned to  another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to me on June\n11, 2007.  I issued a Notice of Hearing on June 18, 2007 and the hearing was conducted on\nJuly 23, 2007.  At the hearing, Department Counsel introduced four (4) exhibits\n(Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 1-4.  Applicant testified and introduced nineteen (19) exhibits\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A-S).  The hearing transcript was received at DOHA on August\n1, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The SOR contains eight\n(8) allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  In his response to the SOR,\nApplicant admits allegation 1.d. and denies all other allegations.  All specific admissions are\naccepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF\nFACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nThe February 20, 2007 SOR alleges the following: \n\n3\n1.a. Applicant was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of\n$61,493.00 on a Federal tax lien entered against him on or about October 2000.  In his\nresponse, Applicant denies this allegation and claims the actual value of the lien was\n$43,775.46.  He made payments on this debt, as part of an agreement  reached on his behalf\nby a \u201ctax representative\u201d (Tr at 41,42).   Applicant states that this debt was paid off during the\nescrow process when the house was sold on April 27, 2006 (Response and Tr at 38-42).  The\nescrow documents from April 2006) corroborate that this debt has been satisfied and the\nFederal tax lien released (AX A and AX B).\n1.b. Applicant was indebted to State B in the approximate amount of $25,933.00 on a\nstate tax lien entered against him in March 2000 (AX D).   Applicant denies this allegation and\nclaims the tax lien was settled in November 2005, when the total taxes due were paid off\nduring the escrow process when the house was sold on April 27, 2006 (Response and Tr at 41-\n44). The attached copy of the escrow document corroborates that this debt has been satisfied\n(AX A and AX D).\n1.c.  Applicant was indebted to Bank C in the approximate amount of $281.00 on an\naccount more than 120 days past due as of July 2006.  Applicant denies this allegation and\nclaims the $281.00 was part of a larger amount of $9,540.00 owed to this creditor that was\npaid off during the escrow process when his house was sold on April 27, 2006 (Tr at 45, 46).\nThe attached copy of the escrow document corroborates that this debt has been satisfied (AX\nA and AX E).\n1.d.   Applicant was indebted to Creditor D in the approximate amount of $2,006.00 on\nan account charged off in about 2003.  He has had some difficulty tracking down the present\nholder of the debt (Tr at 45).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits this debt and states\nhe will pay off the debt as soon as he is able to locate the present holder of the debt.\n1.e.  Applicant was indebted to Creditor E in the approximate amount of $3,402.00 on\nan account placed for collection in about July 2003.  In his response, Applicant denies the\ndebt.  He disputes the debt.  He states that the creditor has initiated legal action, to which\nApplicant was responding as of March 8, 2007, claiming improper conduct by the creditor (Tr\nat 50, 51). He promises a payoff with 30 days of resolution.\n1.f.  Applicant was indebted to Creditor F (same creditor as in 1.e., above) in the\napproximate amount of $10,619.00 on an account placed for collection in about July 2003. \nIn his response, Applicant denies the debt.  He states that the creditor has initiated legal action,\nto which Applicant was responding as of March 8, 2007, claiming improper conduct by the\ncreditor (Tr at 50, 51). He promises a payoff with 30 days of resolution.\n1.g.  Applicant was indebted to Creditor G in the approximate amount of $157.00 on\n\n4\nan account placed for collection in about January 2004.  In his response, Applicant denied this\ndebt, claiming it did not exist.  He has been attempting to locate the present holder of the debt\nand promises a prompt payoff when he learns the debt is valid and owing. \n1.h.  Applicant was indebted to Bank H in the approximate amount of $6,551.00 on an\naccount placed for collection in about January 2004.  In his response, Applicant denied this\ndebt.  He believed it may be \u201can earlier duplicate of the debt(s) [cited in 1.e. and 1.f., above].\nHe stated that \u201cif not, I will contact the debt holder and pay off the debt in 30 to 60 days\u201d\n(Response).  He states that the creditor has initiated legal action, to which Applicant\nresponded, as of March 8, 2007, claiming improper conduct by the creditor (Tr at 50, 51).  He\npromises a full payoff with 30 days of resolution.\nApplicant\u2019s overall debt was incurred during the period from August 1996 to August\n2003, during which time Applicant was employed for only about 30 months (Tr at 32). The\ntotal of the debts alleged in the SOR is about $110,442.00, but he also owed money on other\ndebts, and has paid off about $119,000 over the past few years (Response to SOR).  Even\nbefore he sold his house and paid off the balance of his debts, he had reached an agreement\nwith State B and had begun to make payments on his state tax debt (Tr at 33).  His intent has\nbeen to prioritize his debts, but to resolve all of them eventually.  He served in the U.S.\nmilitary for 20 years and has had no legal or financial problems except for those involved in\nthe present case (Tr at 34).  Through all of this, he has been caring for an adult son who had\nserious medical problems and subsequently passed away (Tr at 35).       \nHis current take home pay is about $3,200.00 per month (Tr at 64).  He also receives\nmilitary retirement of about $2,500 per month and $1,800 in social security (Tr at 64).  His\nwife received disability payments from Social Security of about \u201c$600/$700 per month\u201d and\na pension of about $400.00 per month (Tr at 65). \nApplicant believes his present delinquent debt is \u201cmaybe $20,00.00\u201d (Tr at 56) and\ninvolve debts he is disputing or where he has been unable to contact the debt holder, who are\napparently several layers away from the original creditor (Tr at 54-58).  The record shows\nApplicant to be a man of integrity.  He has demonstrated a willingness and ability to resolve\nall remaining delinquent debts (Tr at 58). \nPOLICIES \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider\nthe following nine generic factors: (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3). The\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\n\n5\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors,\nindividually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate\nquestion of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold\na security clearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations\nrelieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or\ninformation are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the\ninitial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden\nof persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within\nspecific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6,\nas amended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s\nsecurity.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor judgment, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n   \nDisqualifying Conditions: 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and ( c) a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\nMitigating Conditions: 20.(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . . . unexpected medical\nemergency or death) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 20. ( c)\n\n6\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and 20.(d) the\nindividual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems substantially occurred during a seven-year period of on\nand off employment between 1993 and 2003, and the terminal illness of his son (Tr at 74). The\ntotal amount cited in the SOR is about $110,000.00, and Applicant has incurred other debts\nas well.  Several  years ago, he sold his house and used the proceeds to pay off specific debts\ncited in the escrow documents, substantially reducing  his delinquent debt load.  As discussed\nabove, his current monthly income is more than $6,500.00 per month.  His house payments are\nabout $1,200 per month.  After his monthly operating expenses, as discussed in his hearing\ntestimony (Tr at 65-69), he has a positive balance.  In his bank account, he has about\n$70,000.00, the remainder from the sale of his home (Tr at 70).  He also has about $64,00.00\nin a 401K plan and about $95.000.00 equity in his new home (Tr at 71).  \nApplicant could have done some things better, and moved faster on resolving all of the\ncited debts, but he has made significant inroads into his overall debts and has taken steps to\nidentify and contact the creditors whose debts have not yet been satisfied.  Applicant is a\npersistent man, perhaps even stubborn, but the record does not suggest any unwillingness or\ninability to resolve his debts.  He has stated his intent to resolve all debts once he can locate\nand negotiate with the current holder of each remaining debt.  \nClearly, he has the ability to do so.  Applicant has paid some $70,000 in tax liens even\nthough he thought the liens were unfair. As to those debts not yet paid, I conclude that\nApplicant  has not yet done so because he has not satisfied himself as to the actual amount\nowed or the current holders of the debts. While he could have done more, perfection is not the\nstandard. Overall, he has demonstrated a strong personal ethic (responsibilities to his family\nand work).  There were no apparent problems when he had the cited debts, which makes the\nlevel of  risk even smaller, now that he has significantly reduced those debts and has sizeable\nfinancial assets as well.\nIn summary, I conclude that Applicant has adequately demonstrated financial\nrehabilitation and mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns.  Accordingly, I conclude that\nApplicant possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of somone seeking\nto hold a DOD security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive\nare hereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nFor the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph  l.g.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.h.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \n        \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

SAX\nADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPer Se \nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 49 and was born in the U.S. His sister moved to Israel five years ago.  Their\ncontacts are infrequent.  His Vietnam-born wife is a U.S. citizen. They have two small children.  His\nwife\u2019s parents, brother and an acquaintance are citizens/residents of Vietnam.  Applicant\u2019s\nrelationships with them are not close.  Applicant\u2019s lifelong personal, emotional, financial, and other\nties are almost exclusively with this country.  He has had extensive security training over the past\n27 years.  His dedication to this country is attested to by his Facility Security Officer and two other\ncolleagues.  He avers, and the overall evidence establishes that he is a man of integrity who can be\ncounted upon to report any improper contacts.  Mitigation has been shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.  On February 26, 2007,\nApplicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The\nmatter was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge who issued a Notice of Hearing on\nApril 13, 2007.  The matter was transferred to me on April 19, 2007.  The hearing was conducted\non May 11, 2007. The Government introduced one (1) exhibit (Government\u2019s Exhibit (GX) 1) and\nseveral Official Notice documents.  Applicant testified, and called three other witnesses.  The\ntranscript was received on May 24, 2007. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 49-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains five\n(5) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant admits all five allegations, which\nare accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n1.a. - Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Vietnam.\n1.b. - Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Vietnam.\n1.c. - Applicant\u2019s sister is a native born U.S. citizen who has lived in Israel for the past five\nyears.  She holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship.\n1.d. - Applicant\u2019s acquaintance is a citizen and resident of Vietnam.  He works for the\n\n3\nVietnamese government as an air traffic controller.  They are not close and their contacts are\ninfrequent and casual. \n1.e. - Applicant traveled to Vietnam in at least March 2000 (on business for his company)\nand in February 2002, May 2003, and September 2004 to visit his wife\u2019s parents.  \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen, born in 1957.  He graduated from an American\nuniversity in 1980, and has worked for the past 27 years for the same defense contractor, where is\nnow a Senior Software Engineer.  He has held a DoD security clearance for the past 27 years, with\nno suggestion in the  record that he has ever violated any company or DoD security protocols.  Three\nwork colleagues are aware of his foreign ties and attest to his integrity and dedication to the U.S. \nHis parents are United States citizens born in Israel (then British-ruled Palestine) in the\n1930s.  He met his current wife in Vietnam in 2000, while he was there on company business (Tr\nat 21).  She was born in Vietnam in 1974. They were married in 2002.  She became a U.S. citizen\nin 2006 and lives with Applicant in the United States.  She is proud to be an American and would\nnot do anything to jeopardize her citizenship or her family\u2019s well being (Tr at 22).  They have two\nchildren, born in the U.S. in 2003 and 2005 (Tr at 22).  She sends about $200.00 per month to her\nparents in Vietnam.  Applicant\u2019s net worth is about $600,000.00, all of which is in the United States.\nHe has no financial or other interests in either Israel or Vietnam (Tr at 23). \nPOLICIES\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the\nDirective, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d Viewed in an overall\ncontext, under E2.2.3.of the Directive, the ultimate determination of whether the granting or\ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful consideration of the\n\n4\nfollowing, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. Explained further\nbelow (emphasis added):  \nThe Whole Person Concept: Under Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 18, Section 2: the\nDoD adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an\naffirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.\nThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the\nfollowing factors: (a)(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (a)(2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (a)(3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (a)(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (a)(5) the extent\nto which the conduct is voluntary; (a)(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (a)(7) the motivation for the conduct; (a)(8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (a)(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  I have\ncarefully considered all none factors and find them all to be favorable to Applicant\u2019s position.  \nAn Administrative Judge must also consider the Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions for\nthe specific Guideline(s) cited in the SOR. In the present case, only Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nis alleged.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA careful analysis of the SOR and record shows that only Guideline B is alleged, and that the\nGovernment\u2019s concern is `primarily focused not on any questionable conduct by Applicant but, rather,\non the fact and circumstances of his relationships with relatives in Israel and Vietnam.  \nForeign Influence - The Concern:  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure  or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest\nis located, including  but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  \nI have carefully considered all of the official notice documents submitted by Department\nCounsel and have considered the allegations against Applicant in the context of how the U.S.\nGovernment views Israel and Vietnam. \nIsrael\n\n5\nIsrael is a traditional ally of the United States and has been active for many years in  joint\nprograms involving  weaponry and the sharing of intelligence.  At the same time, Israel is recognized\nby the U.S. Government as being an active information gatherer outside of official channels in the\nU.S., although  none of the reported incidents appear to have involved threats, coercion, or pressure.\nApplicant\u2019s only family, personal, or emotional connection to Israel is the presence there of\nhis sister, who is about 47 and moved to Israel about five or six years ago, after her divorce (Tr at 41).\nApplicant has no significant financial or other ties to Israel (Tr at 16).  His parents left Israel more\nthan half a century ago, and became U.S. citizens in 1958.  They are U.S. citizens only (GX 1).\nApplicant does not consider himself to be, or ever to have been, a dual citizen the U.S. and Israel.\nHe is a product of American society, having grown up here and been educated in American schools.\nHe has not visited Israel in the past seven years.  He and his sister have \u201cdrifted apart\u201d and they are\n\u201cnot close\u201d (Tr at 16, 41-44).  Most contact with his sister is by e-mail once or twice a year (Tr at 16).\nShe comes periodically to visit their parents who live in the U.S.  She is also a citizen of the U.S. and\ncan return here anytime (Id.).  He does not believe she is in a \u201cposition to be exploited by the Israeli\ngovernment\u201d (Tr at 17). \nVIETNAM\nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Vietnam in 1974 (GX 1).  They met  during Applicant\u2019s first\nbusiness trip to Vietnam in 2000.  They married in 2002.  She moved to the U.S. with Applicant, and\nbecame a  naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006.  They have two children who were born in the U.S. in\n2003 and 2005 (Tr at 16).  When they last traveled to Vietnam to see her family, she used her new\nU.S. passport.  They have never been questioned by Vietnamese authorities (Tr at 39).  She is happy\nto live in the U.S. and happy that her children are growing up here rather than in Vietnam.  Applicant\ndoes not believe she would jeopardize their future here by pressuring him to supply information to\nany foreign government (Tr at 16).    \nHis acquaintance in Vietnam is an air traffic controller (Tr at 32-38).  He is actually a friend\nof his wife.  Applicant and the acquaintance have not had mail or phone contact for about four years\n(Tr at 17).  They have met when Applicant and his wife have visited Vietnam, but they \u201cdo little\nbeyond greeting each other\u201d (Id.).  When anyone in Vietnam asks what he does, he describes himself\nsimply as  \u201can engineer\u201d (Tr at 18).  Applicant is aware that Vietnam remains under Communist\ngovernment but nothing in the Official Notice documents cites Vietnam as \u201cassociated with the risk\nof terrorism\u201d (Id.).  In addition, the Official Notice documents do not describe Vietnam as active in\nespionage or information gathering in the U.S.     \nApplicant graduated from an American university in 1980 and has worked for the same\ncontractor in the defense industry ever since, at all time holding a DoD security clearance.  He has\nattended \u201cenumerable security and counterintelligence briefings and has had no security problems\u201d\n(Tr at 19).  He has been successfully reinvestigated for his security clearance twice (Id.).  He credibly\navers that if asked by any relative in Israel or Vietnam, he would report the contact to his Facility\nSecurity Officer (Tr at 21, 45-47). \nApplicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer (FSO) has known him for 26 years and is not aware of\nany security-related problems (Tr at 43).  The company is highly rated by DoD as to the security\neducation of employees (Tr at 49).  On  recross-examination, the FSO testified there was no doubt\n\n6\nin her mind that Applicant would do the right thing if he was ever contacted (Tr at 50).  A second\nwork colleague knows Applicant well and states that Applicant would not be influenced by family\ncontacts and is \u201cvery determined about what he thinks is right and wrong  and would not do anything\nhe thinks is wrong\u201d (Tr at 53).  He  agrees with the FSO that Applicant is no threat to national\nsecurity  (Tr at 52).  Another colleague has known Applicant for about 20 years has worked with\nApplicant on classified programs.  He concurs that Applicant is \u201cnot a threat to national security\u201d (Tr\nat 54, 55).\nIt is a reality that family ties and personal contacts in any foreign country may raise some\nquestions and that the issue becomes of even higher significance if the foreign country is one viewed\nby the U.S. Government as either hostile to the United States or one in which persons or organizations\nexist that act against U.S. interests or that target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with terrorism.  After a thorough reading of the Official Notices documents and other\ninformation and arguments provided by Department, I find no reasonable basis for concluding that\nApplicant\u2019s specific ties to either Israel or Vietnam are a disqualifying factor  under the specific facts\nand circumstances of this case.\nIn addition, the language of the current Directive, which applies to all SOR issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, is significantly different from the previous version in several important aspects.\nI have considered Disqualifying Condition (DC), which state: 7.(a) applies if the foreign contact\n\u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\u201d\nDC 7.(b) applies if a foreign contact creates a potential conflict between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help the foreign contact\nby providing that information.\nMitigating Conditions authorize consideration of whether 8.(a) the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely that the person will be placed in a position\nof \u201chaving to choose between the interests of a foreign the interests of the U.S.;\u201d and 8(b) there is no\nconflict of interest, either because  the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties to the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterests in favor of the U.S. \nDisqualifying Conditions: 7.(a) contacts with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion 7.(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship  status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or inducement.\nMitigating Conditions: 8.(b) - there is no conflict of interests, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant was born in the United States almost 50 years ago, grew up and was educated here,\nand has worked on contracts requiring a security clearance for the past 27 years.  I view the evidence\n\n7\nsupporting the SOR allegations under both the Foreign Influence guideline and the Directive\u2019s\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nIt is a fact that Applicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen  of the United States by birth and Israel\nbecause her parents were born there, in the 1930s (GX 1), when it was still part of what was then\nBritish-controlled Palestine.  Applicant\u2019s travel information (Id., at Item 16), does not show any \ntravel to Israel.  This and his testimony about his contacts with his sister do not suggest close ties to\nIsrael or the existence of any plausible risk of the concerns cited in the Guideline C Concerns.\nIt is also a fact that Applicant met his wife while on company business in Vietnam in 2000\nand that his travel there in 2002, 2003, and 2004, was related to their growing relationship, marriage\nin 2002 and visits to her family in 2003 and 2004.  They do not speak English and he speaks only a\nfew words of Vietnamese. The $200.00 per month his wife sends to her parents is the only financial\nconnection between the United States to Vietnam.  In any case, the $200.00 is minimal in relationship\nto his $600,000.00 net worth in the United States and is not considered to have any security\nsignificance.\nIt is basic to the adjudication process that the ultimate burden of proof is on the Applicant  and\nthat any doubts must be resolved against the granting of a clearance.  In this case, there is nothing in\nthe evidence establishing whether or not Applicant\u2019s relatives in Israel and Vietnam might be agents\nof the foreign governments or are in a position to be used, voluntarily or not, and knowingly or not,\nto seek to persuade Applicant to act against U.S. security interests.  To the degree that there is a risk,\nit is a hypothetical one, based primarily on the undisputed presence of the relatives in Israel and\nVietnam, but the relationships are not close and are minimal compared to his relationships with those\nin the U.S.  What is absent from the record is any evidence supporting an inference that Applicant\nwould feel \u201cforced\u201d to choose between his loyalty to them and to the United States.  In fact, the\ncontrary has been shown to be the case. \nBased on the entire record, including but not limited to the evidence cited above, I conclude\nthat the risks of Applicant being asked to act improperly by his sister in Israel or his in-laws in\nVietnam, are minimal.  At the same time, the evidence clearly establishes Applicant to be a man of\nintegrity who is dedicated to his country\u2019s interests and understands his obligation to protect his\ncountry and to report any improper contacts to company authorities.  His commitment to the U.S. is\nsuch as he would not feel that he had to choose between opposing interests.  \nIn summary, and looking at the concerns as stated above, I further conclude that nothing in\nthe record suggests (1) that Applicant has \u201cdivided loyalties;\u201d (2) that he may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, of government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests; or (3) that he is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest,.\nApplicant has a solid record of maturity, integrity, and service to his adopted country. Despite\nwhatever risk may exist solely because he has family members in Israel (sister) and Vietnam (in-\nlaws), nothing in the record  suggests  that he would hesitate before acting instinctively to protect U.S.\ninterests.  Under the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d he has not done or said anything that raises any\nquestions about where his loyalties and dedication lie; nor does the record suggest any reason to\ndeprive the United States of his valuable services.  In summary, the record as a whole leads to the\n\n8\nconclusion that Applicant has the integrity, good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required\nof anyone seeking  a DoD security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.\n.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.          \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.d.       \n         \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.e.           \nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 18, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification of a\nsecurity-clearance application. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nApril 3, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 3.1.20.\n3\n Id. \n4\n Directive, \u00b6 2.2 (By mutual agreement, the Directive extends to other federal agencies, to include the State\n5\nDepartment). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s reply to the SOR was received by DOHA on November 21, 2007, and\nhe requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 9, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on March 12, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was received on\nMarch 20, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nApplicant objected to Exhibit 3, which consists primarily of an interview of\nApplicant that was recorded in a report of investigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S.\nOffice of Personnel Management (Tr. 28\u201335). His objection was based on the general\nrule that a background ROI may not be received and considered by an administrative\njudge.  The exception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be received with an\n3\nauthenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of\nEvidence.\u201d  In light of the objection, I deferred ruling and indicated department counsel\n4\nwould have an opportunity to lay a foundation for the exhibit (Tr. 35, 38). Thereafter, the\nexhibit was not offered into evidence again. Accordingly, it was not admitted and it has\nnot been considered. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges ten delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a\u2013\u00b6 1.j) ranging\nfrom $10 to $6,328 for about $15,556 in total. He admitted all the debts in his response\nto the SOR. Under Guideline E, he denies the two allegations that he made deliberately\nfalse statements when answering two questions about his financial record on a security-\nclearance application. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old HVAC installer who works as a contract employee for a\ncompany that provides services to the State Department.  During 2005, he worked for\n5\n\n3\nthis company overseas installing an HVAC system in an embassy. He did this with the\nbenefit of an interim security clearance. Currently, he has a contingent-employment\nrelationship with the company to work at another overseas embassy, and this\nrelationship is the basis to process Applicant\u2019s security-clearance application (Exhibit\nC). In addition, Applicant\u2019s employment status, which is the jurisdictional basis for the\ncase,  was addressed at the start of the hearing (Tr. 17\u201321).\nApplicant has been married since 1979. His wife is now 50 years old. They\ncurrently have an adult son living with them. His wife has been employed for many\nyears at a utility company and she continues working there today. In about 1997 or\n1998, his wife was required to undergo a hysterectomy and was out of work for about\neight weeks or so (Exhibit 2). Applicant\u2019s employment situation at the time was\nunstable; he worked for an aircraft company where he experienced periodic layoffs and\na months-long strike. Overwhelmed, Applicant started drinking heavily and using illegal\ndrugs. Months later he went into treatment and he has not used alcohol or drugs since\n1998. Applicant points to this period as the start of his financial problems. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented (Exhibits 2, 4 and 5).\nFor example, a June 2005 credit report shows 15 accounts (some with zero balances)\nin the collections section of the report (Exhibit 4). In total, the balance due for the\ncollection accounts is about $3,726. \nThe delinquent debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and\nthe admitted documentary evidence. He has not paid, settled, or resolved any of the\ndebts in the SOR. He does not intend to pay these debts because doing so would \u201cbe\nlike opening up a can of worms, so to speak,\u201d and he is financially unable to pay them\n(Tr. 56\u201357). Instead, he is focused on his current accounts and moving forward. \nApplicant has resolved an outstanding debt owed to a state department of\nindustrial relations (Exhibits A and 2). The debt was due to an overpayment to\nApplicant. The $2,805 debt, which was reduced to a judgment in May 2003, was\nsatisfied in early 2007. \nIn his testimony, he estimated having about $81 in the bank. He explained that\nhe lived week-to-week. In general, Applicant was unaware of the details of his overall\nfinancial situation because his wife handles all such matters. \nApplicant presented a September 2007 credit report from one of the major credit\nreporting agencies (Exhibit B). Although it contains the $2,804 judgment mentioned\nabove, the report otherwise shows Applicant is in good shape. The report lists a total of\neight accounts, two of which are closed, and all eight accounts are described as pays\nas agreed and in good standing.     \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in 2004, and then it was\nsigned again by him in May 2005 (Exhibit 1). When signing the application, he certified\nthat his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and\n\n Department of Navy v.

In particular, he answered two\nquestions about his financial record as follows:\n\u2022\nQuestion 37\u2013asking if in the last seven years he had any unpaid judgments\nagainst him that had not been paid, to which he replied \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose\nany unpaid judgments. \n\u2022\nQuestion 38\u2013asking if in the last seven years he had been over 180-days\ndelinquent on any debts, to which he replied \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose any debts.\nBut he disclosed a delinquent credit card account for $1,877 in response to another\nquestion. His negative answers to Questions 37 and 38 were the result of honest\nmistakes in completing the paperwork (Tr. 65\u201367). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.6\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n7\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n8\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n9\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n10\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n11\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n14\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n15\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n16\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n17\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n18\n5\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n12\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n13\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.14\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.15\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n16\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n17\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n18\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n19\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n20\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\n21\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n MC 4 is \u201c the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n22\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n23\nconditions under Guideline E).  \n6\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n19\n20\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none\napply. Two deserve discussion. First, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014does not apply.  No doubt the various circumstances that Applicant and his\n21\nwife experienced during 1997\u20131998 contributed to the financial problems and strained\nthe family budget. But so much time has passed since then that it is unreasonable to\npoint to that period as a factor in mitigation. \nSecond, a potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to\ninitiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  He\n22\nhas taken some positive steps to resolve his financial problems as evidenced by paying\noff the $2,803 judgment. But his efforts, in light of the remaining unaddressed financial\nproblems, are not enough to qualify as a good-faith effort. \nApplicant has done little to demonstrate an intent to clean up his financial house.\nConcerning his past delinquent debts, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic and\nworkable plan; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan; and (3) a\nmeasurable improvement to the situation. Although his current financial situation looks\nlike it has improved (Exhibit B), his past delinquent debts cannot be overlooked in\nassessing his overall financial situation and how it relates to his current security\nsuitability. At this point, it is likely that the financial problems will continue or recur.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n23\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations [that may] raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n24\n7\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d24\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made false statements when providing answers\nto two questions about his financial record. He denied giving false answers in his reply\nto the SOR, and he explained in his hearing testimony that his incorrect answers were\ndue to mistakes made in completing the security-clearance application. His explanation\nis credible. Coupled with his disclosure of a delinquent credit card account in response\nto another question, the record evidence is not sufficient to prove that Applicant was\ntrying to hide his financial problems. In light of this failure of proof, Guideline E is\ndecided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations and\npersonal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On March 30, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on  December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 7, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2007.  On July 26, 2007,\nI convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted\nexhibits that were admitted into evidence.  Applicant was given additional time to submit other\nexhibits, but failed to do so.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  He\nadmitted all allegations except Subparagraphs 1.u, 1.x, 1.ff, and 1.pp.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 37 years old, unmarried, and works for a defense contractor as a production\ncontrol dispatcher.  He earns about $2,400 monthly.  He lives with his mother and aunt, and shares\nthe rent on their apartment.  He gives his mother $100 to $200 monthly.  He has no credit cards\nexcept for the business credit card used for business purposes.  He drives a 2006 car purchased new,\nwhich is titled in his mother\u2019s name because of his poor credit history.  The cost, with all finance\ncharges included, is about $20,000.  He pays $500 monthly on the car.  He has about $300 to $400\neach month available to repay debts. (Tr. 13-21, 64, 76)\nApplicant has 42 delinquent debts totaling $58,076.  Of these debts, 12 debts are under $100\nand total $881.  These debts, in addition to another 24 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR which\nare under $1,000, total $11,959.  The remaining 6 delinquent debts total about $46,000.  Applicant\nhas not paid or arranged installment payments on any of this delinquent debt.  He pays his current\nbills, and admits he does not care about paying his delinquent debts, and \u201cjust has not done anything\u201d\nabout contacting the creditors to make payments.  He is waiting for them to contact him.  He moved\nthree or four times while incurring these debts.  His interview with a Government investigator was\nin June 2006, and he learned then of the magnitude of his delinquent debts.  After that interview he\ntook no action to pay these debts.  Applicant is paying $50 monthly to the Internal Revenue Service\non a tax debt by garnishment, which he should complete by the end of 2008.  Applicant was on\ndisability for four months in 2004, after being injured on his job.  Later, he was disabled from\nAugust 2005 to December 2005. (Tr. 19, 23-67, 72-75, 85; Exhibits 2-4)\n\n3\nThe following debts of Applicant are alleged in the SOR and remain unpaid or otherwise\nunresolved.\n1.a. $804 electric bill\nUnpaid, Tr. 23-25; Exhibits 2-4\n1.b. $100 medical bill from accident\nUnpaid, Tr. 25, 26; Exhibits 2-4\n1.c. $650 television service\nUnpaid, Tr. 27, 28; Exhibits 2-4\n1.d. $534 cell phone service\nUnpaid, Tr. 28-31; Exhibits 2-4\n1.e. $7,306 car purchase debt\nCo-signer for cousin, unpaid, Tr. 31-33;\nExhibits 2-4\n1.f. $320 for check not paid\nUnpaid, Tr. 33, 34; Exhibits 2-4\n1.g. $3,980 for auto purchase, car returned\nUnpaid, Tr. 34-37; Exhibits 2-4\n1.h. $241 for check loan\nUnpaid, Tr. 37-39; Exhibits 2-4\n1.i. $612, Applicant uncertain of debt\nUnpaid, Tr. 39-41; Exhibits 2-4\n1.j. $205 for cell phone service\nUnpaid, Tr. 41; Exhibits 2-4\n1.k. $230 for rented video tapes\nUnpaid, Tr. 41-43; Exhibits 2-4\n1.l. $514 for cell phone service\nUnpaid, Tr. 43, 44; Exhibits 2-4\n1.m. $285 for a medical debt\nUnpaid, Tr. 44, 45; Exhibits 2-4\n1.n. $805 for a medical debt\nUnpaid, Tr. 46, 47; Exhibits 2-4\n1.o. $602 for a cable television bill\nUnpaid, Tr. 47, 48; Exhibits 2-4\n1.p. $627 for telephone bill\nUnpaid, Tr. 48, 49; Exhibits 2-4\n1.q. $75 for magazine subscriptions\nUnpaid, Tr. 49, 50; Exhibits 2-4\n1.r. $150 judgment from 2004\nUnpaid, Tr. 50, 51; Exhibits 2-4\n1.s. $51 for medical debt\nUnpaid, Tr. 51, 52; Exhibits 2-4\n1.t. $146 for telephone bill which Applicant\nclaims is the same as 1.p.\nUnpaid, Tr. 52, 53; Exhibits 2-4\n1.u. $499 for 2004 judgment on apartment\nrent\nUnpaid, Tr. 53-56; Exhibits 2-4\n1.v. $391 for telephone bill\nUnpaid, Tr. 56, 57; Exhibits 2-4\n1.w. $15 for a medical bill\nUnpaid, Tr. 57; Exhibits 2-4\n1.x. $1,600 for a 2003 judgment for\napartment rent which Applicant claims is he\nsame as 1.u.\nUnpaid, Tr. 53-56; Exhibits 2-4\n\n4\n1.y. $322 for 2003 collection account\nUnpaid, Tr. 57; Exhibits 2-4\n1.z. $425 for 2003 telephone debt which\nApplicant claims is the same as 1.v.\nUnpaid, Tr. 58; Exhibits 2-4\n1.aa-1.ee, and 1.hh-1.jj $640 total, for checks\nwritten on joint account with former\ngirlfriend containing insufficient funds\nUnpaid, Tr. 58-62; Exhibits 2-4\n1. ff. $685 for a debt about which Applicant is\nuncertain\nUnpaid, Tr. 60, 61; Exhibits 2-4\n1.gg. $343 for 2003 electric bill\nUnpaid, Tr. 60, 61; Exhibits 2-4\n1.kk. $153 for a medical debt from 2001\nUnpaid, Tr. 62; Exhibits 2-4\n1.ll. $19,411 for the debt on a repossessed\nautomobile\nUnpaid, Tr. 63, 64; Exhibits 2-4\n1.mm. $12,649 for the same repossessed\nautomobile\nUnpaid, Tr. 63, 64; Exhibits 2-4\n1.nn. $1,171 for a 2000 judgment Applicant\nclaims was repaid by garnishment, but has no\ndocuments to prove his claim\nUnpaid, Tr. 64-66; Exhibits 2-4\n1.oo. $777 for a cellular telephone bill from\nFebruary 2000\nUnpaid, Tr. 66, 67; Exhibits 2-4\n1.pp. $758 for a debt about which Applicant\nis uncertain, but he has not taken any action to\ndispute or verify\nUnpaid, Tr. 67; Exhibits 2-4\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on February 13, 2006. He\ndeliberately failed to disclose in four blocks of questions the information concerning his personal\nfinances and credit history as requested on the SCA.  Applicant did not disclose any repossessions\nin the past seven years in answer to Question 27B, omitting the automobile repossessions on his\ncredit record.  Next, he failed to disclose the four judgments against him in answer to Question 27D\nlisted in the SOR.  Then, Applicant failed to disclose his financial delinquencies older than 180 days\nin the past seven years in answer to Question 28A.  These delinquencies are listed in the SOR.\nFinally, Applicant failed to list any current debts over 90 days delinquent as requested in Question\n28B, as listed in the SOR.  Applicant has prior military service and had a secret clearance on active\nduty.  He completed similar forms in the past and knew what information was required.  He claims\nhe submitted the SCA before he had an accurate list of debts, and relied on someone who told him\nto tell the Government investigator what his debts were but not list them on the SCA.  Applicant\nknew he had delinquent debts.  Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR admits he deliberately falsified his\nSCA answers. (Tr. 68, 69; Exhibits 1-4)\n\n5\nApplicant submitted three character reference letters.  The writers view him as a very\ndependable, reliable, and conscientious employee.  Applicant received the 2006 company award for\ncustomer satisfaction. (Exhibits A-C)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\n\n6\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes, including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations: Applicant has unpaid debts dating from 2000.  He has undertaken\nno efforts to establish repayment plans for any of the debts.  Instead, after moving three or four times\nand failing to inform his creditors of his latest address, he waits for them to find him and send\ncollection letters.  There are several debts of small amounts under either $100 or $1,000 that he could\nhave repaid in the past year to show he was trying to fulfill his obligations, but he did nothing about\nrepayment even after meeting with the Government investigator in June 2006.  Furthermore, he has\na series of checks written on his account for which there were insufficient funds to pay the checks\nwhen submitted to his bank, all of which remain unresolved.\n\n7\nThe Disqualifying Conditions (DC) applicable are Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \u00b619.b. (indebtedness caused by\nfrivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt), \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and \u00b619.d. (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as check fraud).\nBased on the evidence introduced at the hearing, and Applicant\u2019s admissions, there are no\nMitigating Conditions (MC) applicable.  Applicant has done nothing about repaying or resolving any\nof the debts listed in the SOR.  He failed to meet his burden of proof that any MC are applicable.\nPersonal Conduct:  DC \u00b616.a (involving deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or determine\ntrustworthiness) applies.  Applicant knew he had delinquent debts, had experience completing a\nSCA, and yet provided false answers about his finances to Questions 27 and 28.\nThere are no MC applicable.  Applicant was confronted by the Government investigator in\nthe interview before making full disclosure about his debts.  He provided no evidence that he relied\non the advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel in making his answer, even though he was\ngiven additional time to submit more exhibits.  These omissions were substantial.  Applicant failed\nto meet his burden of proof that any \u00b617 MC are applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nUnder this concept, Applicant\u2019s conduct is serious and continuous.  He knew what he was\ndoing when he incurred the debts and then deliberately refused to take any action to repay them.  He\ndisplayed a consistent pattern of incurring debts and not repaying them.  He was over 30 years of age\nwhen this conduct occurred, so he was mature and knew what he was doing.  His actions were\nvoluntary, and any justification he gave about debts incurred while on disability are not persuasive.\nHe continued to have an income during that period.  He could have paid the debts instead of ignoring\nthem.  There is potential for coercion or duress with this volume of delinquent debts.  With his\npattern of behavior on debts, it is likely it will recur in the future.  He demonstrated by all his actions\nrelated to his debts that he lacks good judgment, lacks self-control by incurring additional debt\nbefore repaying older debt, and is not reliable.\nAfter considering all of the evidence, I conclude the financial considerations security concern\nagainst Applicant.  I also conclude the personal conduct security concern against Applicant.  Finally,\nthe \u201cwhole person concept\u201d I conclude against Applicant.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.pp:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a to 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nPhilip S.

Beginning in 1999, he\naccumulated debt that he resolved through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2007, after attempts to manage\na repayment plan through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was dismissed in 2003. Much of the $23,000\ndebt was attributable to matters outside of his control, and he made a good faith effort to resolve it.\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline.\nClearance is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated March 21, 2007).\n2\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated October 25, 2005).\n3\nId.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR, alleges security concerns under Guideline F\n1\n(Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to\nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn March 21, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On June 21, 2007, the case was transferred to me. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on June 28, 2007. At the July 17, 2007 hearing, the Government\nintroduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 into evidence without objections. Applicant\ntestified and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through F into evidence without objections from\nDepartment Counsel. DOHA received the transcript on July 27, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all factual allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F,\nsubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.

He paid $75 a week out of his\npaycheck toward the debt repayment plan. He was not ignoring his creditors.5\nIn 2002, Applicant was laid off from his work.  He anticipated that he would be called back\nto work after a short period of time. He called an attorney for advice because he could not afford the\n$75 a week for the repayment plan. His attorney advised him to pay $55 a week.  This amount came\n6\nfrom his unemployment check of $263. He was never called back to work. Applicant returned to\ncourt and the Judge dismissed the Chapter 13 in February 2003.  \n7\nApplicant had no steady employment from 2002 until 2005. He worked when he could as a\nhandyman for a friend. He had no medical insurance. He could barely pay for his daily necessities.\nHis medical bills continued to mount. He also could not pay his car note and his car was repossessed\nin 2003.8\nIn October 2005, Applicant applied for his current job. He started as a temporary worker for\nthe company with no health insurance. After completing the security application, he learned that\nthere were some questions about his financial situation and he was not given an interim clearance,\nrather he received a LAN account.  A security investigation revealed that Applicant had filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy which was dismissed. He also learned from a credit report that he still had\nseveral delinquent debts that he thought were taken care of when the Chapter 13 was dismissed in\n2003. During the investigative interview, Applicant told the investigator that he believed the Chapter\n13 dismissal meant that he did not owe the remaining debt. He was also unaware that he could have\nfiled a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to eliminate his debt. He did not understand the difference between the\ntwo types of bankruptcy, nor the difference between dismissal and discharge, until after he applied\nfor a security clearance in October 2005.\nIn 2006, Applicant learned that he could not re file his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His attorney\nadvised that his option was filing a Chapter 7. Applicant went to one of the medical centers where\nhe owed money and worked with them on a debt consolidation plan.  He borrowed a small amount\n9\nfrom his credit union to pay some of the debts. He made several payments of $20 to the medical\ncenter.  \n10\n\nGX 4 (Chapter 7 Filing January 16, 2007); GX 9 (Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition Discharge, dated May 10,\n11\n2007).\nTr.65.\n12\nApplicant\u2019s Financial Statement, dated February 2007.\n13\nAX B (Recommendation Letter from Supervisor).\n14\nAX F (Recommendation Letter from Manager).\n15\nAX E and F (Performance Review for 2006 and 2007).\n16\nAX D and E (Letters of Recommendation)\n17\n Department of the Navy v.

The debts alleged in the SOR have been discharged in the\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.  Applicant has no debt at this time.\n11\nApplicant still occasionally suffers from his pancreatitis and is a diabetic. When the attack\noccurs, Applicant has severe pain, chills and he cannot breathe. He has medication to help him digest\nhis food, but this does not affect the pain. The problem can flare up at any time. He also has had\nchest pains and went to the emergency room in 2006. This resulted in more emergency room bills\nto the medical center.12\nApplicant now earns $2,300.80 net a month. He has a net monthly remainder of $428. His\nposition with the contractor is full time with health benefits. He is guaranteed 40 hours a week. He\nbudgets and received counseling through his bankruptcy. He has a certificate of debtor education and\ncompleted a course on financial management.  Applicant has no credit cards and has some savings.\nHe owns his car and has no car payments.13\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor  and facility security office wrote that Applicant is trustworthy\nand very dependable. He is a valuable team member who approaches each task without frustration\nor hesitation. He is willing to work on anything and is very helpful.  He has a calm demeanor and\n14\nis very flexible. In addition, he is very reliable and requires little supervision. Applicant performed\nhis job without any attendance or performance issues.  They both recommend Applicant as a solid\n15\nemployee. His latest performance reviews are fully satisfactory.  A former supervisor who has\n16\nknown Applicant for 30 years regards him as respectable, dignified and trustworthy.  Applicant is\n17\nan ex-military man who is a hard worker and is proud of his country.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n18\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n19\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n20\n Id.\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n23\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n24\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n25\n6\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n19\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n20\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n21\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.22\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n23\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n24\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.25\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n26\n7\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n \nGuideline F:Financial Considerations \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.26\nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),and\nFC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), apply in this case. Applicant had\ndelinquent accounts in the amount of approximately $23,000. His inability to meet his financial\nobligations dates back to 2001 when he filed his Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Petition in 2001 and Chapter\n7 Bankruptcy in January 2007.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered all the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions and found some of them to apply. (FC MC) 20(a) (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20(e) (the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are attributable to his illness in 1998 and subsequent loss of\nemployment in 2000. He continued to work in low paying jobs with no health insurance. His medical\nbills were significant. Thus, 20 (b) applies. He tried to resolve his debt in 2001 by filing for Chapter\n13 bankruptcy. He was paying $75 a week under that plan. That was a sizeable amount given his\npaycheck. However, he could not continue this amount when he became unemployed in 2002. He then\nlowered the amount to $55 from his unemployment check. He was forced to abandon this plan in 2003.\nWhen the court dismissed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy,  Applicant believed that the debts were\ndischarged. \nApplicant learned that his debt was not discharged after he applied for a security clearance. He\nreceived advice from his attorney  to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a legal and legitimate\nmeans to resolve debt. Since Applicant did not have a permanent position, he opted to file for Chapter\n\n8\n7 in January 2007. Until that time, he paid small amounts to the medical center toward his bills. His\nactions constitute a good-faith effort to repay or resolve debts, as required under 20(d).\nAs a requirement for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant completed a financial management\nclass and financial counseling. He learned how to budget. He has no credit cards and now has steady\nemployment. With the permanent status, he will have health insurance. Thus 20(c) applies in this case.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant  is a 47-year-old hard-working man, who performs well on his job,\nsuch that his immediate supervisor believes he is a candidate for a security clearance.\nHe is a mature individual with an extensive personnel support system. The financial problems\nat issue arose largely from circumstances beyond his control, rather than his own negligence or\nmisconduct. Significantly, he took action to resolve these debts before the initiation of this action.\nUnder Applicant\u2019s current circumstances, the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of his previous\nfinancial problems is remote.\nApplicant was completely cooperative and responsive through out this process. It is clear from\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and actions that he takes this matter seriously and strongly desires to put this\nbehind him. Applicant has demonstrated his determination to achieve financial stability. He has gained\ncontrol of his finances.\nApplicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence. His forthright and candid\nstatements at this hearing and his evident sincerity about avoiding future financial problems all weigh\nin his favor. His effort to pay his delinquent debt (mainly medical) through the Chapter 13 plan rather\nthan ignoring creditors or filing Chapter 7, speak to his reliability and good judgment. Although he\nexperienced numerous medical and employment problems, he accepts responsibility for his situation\nand has worked to resolve it. He has demonstrated a mature and responsible  approach to his finances\nand is living within his means, has learned to manage his money, does not use credit cards, and has\nincurred no new debt. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.\nIn sum, the likelihood of recurrence of similar financial difficulties is low because sufficient\nevidence was presented about the resolution of the debts and current fiscal responsibility. It must be\nemphasized that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were in large measure a product of his illness,\nunemployment and low paying jobs. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all\nthe facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n27\n9\nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations. The evidence leaves me with no doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518\n(1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n27\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For\nthe reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

On February 23, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on March 27, 2007, and elected to have the case decided on the written\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on April\n19, 2007.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who\nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe disqualifying conditions.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\nApplicant admitted to all the debts listed in the SOR. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a medical debt\nin the amount of $78. This debt was paid on March 13, 2007.  \n6\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, are credit card debts, totaling approximately $19,969.\nApplicant does not intend to pay these debts as they are uncollectible, because they are beyond the\nfour-year statute of limitations for her state. The credit reports list the date of last action as\nNovember 2001, for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and February 2002, for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\nis current on her other bills.  \n7\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n8\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n9\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n10\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n11\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n12\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n13\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply in this case. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt, which remains\nmostly unpaid. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) and FC MC 20(e) (the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue).\nApplicant has two unpaid debts, totaling more than $19,900. The debts have not been paid,\nbut are unenforceable due to the running of the statute of limitations. Much of Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties started in 2001, when her husband lost his job shortly after their child was born, followed\nalmost immediately by large medical bills related to their child\u2019s operation. These constitute\nconditions that were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, after these events occurred,\nApplicant did not work for extended periods while she was married, or while attending college after\nher divorce. Applicant graduated from college, and has worked for her current employer for about\n18 months, and has done very little to pay her debts. Even if Applicant\u2019s debts are uncollectible\nbecause of the statute of limitations, the facts and circumstances under which the debts were incurred\nare to be considered when deciding whether Applicant took reasonable steps to address or otherwise\n\nISCR Case No. 01-06776 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2003).\n14\nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n15\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts.  The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\nISCR Case No. 05-00412 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul.\n16\n20, 2005)). \n6\nresolve those debts before the statute of limitations expired.  Applicant did not provide sufficient\n14\ninformation for a finding that her actions are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on her current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; or that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nFC MC 20(a) and FC MC 20(b) are both partially applicable. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received counseling for her problems. Based upon the\nevidence presented, I am unable to make a determination that there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control. FC MC 20(c) does not apply.\nApplicant paid a small debt, but has not paid the two large debts. FC MC 20(d) does not fully\napply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the\nresolution of her debts.  The Appeal board has held that reliance on the running of the statute of\n15\nlimitations does not normally absolve an applicant of his or her responsibilities for security clearance\npurposes, absent other mitigating circumstances.16\nApplicant cites the statute of limitations to support the application of FC MC 20(e). A debt\nmay be uncollectible, and still be a legitimate debt within the meaning of this mitigating condition.\nFC MC 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s financial issues stem from her newborn baby\u2019s operation, which coincided with\nher husband\u2019s losing his job. She was also not working at the time. She did not work for several\nmonths before the child was born, until her child was about 16 months old. She worked for about\nfive to six months, and then did not work again while attending college. Applicant started working\nfor her current employer in December 2005. She did not submit any information about what attempts\nshe made to address her delinquent debts prior to them becoming uncollectible. She merits some\ncredit from the statute of limitations because the debts are uncollectible, which accordingly reduces\nher potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements. I also considered her outstanding\nscholastic record, her employment, and that she is current on her other debts.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on her financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nThe fact that an applicant has been arrested, standing alone, does not prove that the\n1\napplicant engaged in criminal conduct. ISCR Case No. 01-12452 (App. Bd. January 27, 2003).\n2\nOn January 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 10, 2007, and elected to have his case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel (DC) submitted the\nGovernment's written case (FORM) on or about June 4, 2007. Applicant did not file a response to\nthe FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 26 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn March 2000, applicant was arrested and charged with Battery - Family Violence. The\ncharge was dismissed.\nIn May 2006, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Fighting With Hands, Fists, and\n(2) Disorderly Conduct. He was fined about $400.00. He paid the fine.\nIn the Argument section of the FORM, DC states facts about the two incidents that are not\nin evidence; namely, that the first incident involved applicant punching his brother, and that the\nsecond incident involved applicant \u201cwillingly [striking] a stranger over a parking space dispute.\u201d\nNot only is there is no evidence in the record that would shed any light on what happened on the\ndates in question, with respect to the second incident, there is no evidence concerning the actual\ncharge applicant was convicted of.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant was arrested and charged on two occasions with\nviolent criminal acts. With respect to the first incident, the charge was dismissed. Since there is no\ncredible evidence in the record concerning what occurred on the day in question, there is no\nreasonable basis upon which to conclude applicant engaged in criminal conduct.  I therefore\n1\nconclude that this incident has no security significance. With respect to the second incident, the\nevidence establishes that applicant was arrested and charged with two crimes, that he was convicted\nof one or more crimes that may include Fighting With Hands, Fists and/or Disorderly Conduct, and\nthat he was fined about $400.00. Since I cannot determine from the evidence what crime he was\n\n3\nconvicted of, I cannot determine if it was a \u201cserious crime.\u201d Accordingly, there is no reasonable basis\nto apply Disqualifying Condition 31a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), or any of\nthe other Disqualifying Conditions under Guideline J. Based on the foregoing, I conclude that the\nGovernment failed to establish a prima facie case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nGUIDELINE  J: FOR THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

These revised AG replaced those found in enclosure 2 of the Directive,\nwhich is pending revision to incorporate them. Copies of the applicable AG were provided to Applicant with the SOR.\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s letter response to SOR dated Apr. 6, 2007).\n2\nThe government submitted five items in support of the allegations.\n3\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 51-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He was convicted and\nsentenced for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 1991, 1992, and 2004, in three different\nstates. Within a month of his latest DUI arrest, he was arrested for riding a bicycle under the\ninfluence, and has resumed alcohol consumption, at times to the point of intoxication. Applicant\nsubmitted no evidence in extenuation or mitigation of these admitted facts, and failed to meet his\nburden to mitigate security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on August 31, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as a staff engineer. On February 6, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR\ndetailed reasons, under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nof the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\n1\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security\nclearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether\na clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated April 6, 2007,\nadmitting the truth of all of the allegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing.  Applicant did not submit any matters for consideration in extenuation or\n2\nmitigation. At first, the case was mistakenly processed as though Applicant had requested a hearing.\nWhen contacted by Department Counsel to confirm availability for a proposed hearing date, this\nerror was discovered. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the government's written case on June 7, 2007. A complete\ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an\n3\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\nsigned the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on June 20, 2007, and returned\nit to DOHA. Applicant was informed he should respond within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant did not respond further to the FORM, made no objection to consideration of any\n\nItem 4 at question 30.\n4\n3\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel, and offered no evidence in extenuation or mitigation.\nIn the absence of any response, the case was forwarded on July 27, 2007 for consideration by an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT             \nApplicant admitted the truth of every factual allegation set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nalcohol consumption under Guideline G (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f), and by reference to the\nallegations of criminal conduct under Guideline J (subparagraph 2.a). Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, the following findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He has never been\nmarried and has no children. He never served in the military and this is his first application for a\nsecurity clearance. He holds a master\u2019s degree in engineering from a major national university.\nApplicant has consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1990 to at least August 2006. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) He was arrested on or about February 1,\n1991, and charged with Driving Under the Influence. He was found guilty, fined approximately\n$700, and ordered to attend alcohol education classes. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) He was arrested on or about\nOctober 1, 1992, in a different state, and charged with Driving Under the Influence. He was found\nguilty, fined approximately $700, sentenced to 30 days house arrest, ordered to attend weekly alcohol\nclasses, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for one year. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \nApplicant was arrested on or about June 22, 2004, in a third state to which he had moved,\nand charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence and (2) Driving Under the Influence with Blood\nAlcohol Content .08% or Higher (.19%). He pled no contest to count 2 and count 1 was dismissed.\nHe was sentenced to three-years probation, which will not expire until August 19, 2007, to serve two\ndays in jail, ordered to attend a four-month first offenders alcohol awareness program, and fined\napproximately $1,570. His driver\u2019s license was also suspended for 30 days and restricted thereafter\nfor an additional 60 days. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) \nApplicant was arrested in July 2004, and charged with Riding a Bicycle While Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol or Drugs or Both. The district attorney rejected this case on or about September\n21, 2004. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) He resumed his use of alcohol in the Spring of 2005 and continued until at\nleast August 2006. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) As noted above, Applicant provided no evidence in extenuation or\nmitigation of his admitted conduct. He reported on his Security Clearance Application that he has\nnot undergone any alcohol-related treatment or counseling in the seven years preceding its\nsubmission.  \n4\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n5\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n6\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n7\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n4\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs under AG G: Alcohol Consumption, and AG J:\nCriminal Conduct, must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set\nforth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n5\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record were drawn, and no inferences were grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n7\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n10\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nAG \u00b6 21.\n11\n5\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n8\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n9\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n10\nA person seeking access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance\ndecision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, the following conclusions\nare derived with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\u201d  The SOR alleged, and Appellant admitted to, three DUI arrests and convictions,\n11\nin three different states. His most recent DUI involved a BAC of .19% (almost 2.5 times the legal\nlimit), in June 2004. Within a month after that last DUI arrest, he was arrested for riding a bicycle\nwhile under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. He also admitted drinking to excess and the point\nof intoxication at times from 1990 to August 2006, and resuming alcohol consumption after his two\nmost recent arrests. \n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n12\n6\nThis conduct raises security concerns under alcohol consumption disqualifying condition (AC\nDC) 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d). It also raises\nsecurity concerns under AC DC 22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d). There is insufficient evidence in the FORM concerning the nature and extent of\nApplicant\u2019s court-ordered alcohol education classes following each of his three DUI convictions to\nfind that security concerns are raised under AC DCs 22(d), (e), (f), or (g). \nApplicant submitted no evidence tending to establish any alcohol consumption mitigating\ncondition, and, after considering each of them, none is supported by the evidence in the FORM.\nAccordingly, Applicant has not met his burden to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts he\nadmitted, which raise alcohol consumption security concerns.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d  Applicant admitted to four alcohol-related crimes, for three of which he was\n12\nconvicted and sentenced, over a 13-year period.\nCriminal conduct disqualifying condition (CC DC) 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses\u201d) applies. Appellant admitted to, and was convicted of, three DUI offenses, the most\nrecent of which involved a BAC of .19%. CC DC 31 (c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d)\nalso applies to raise security concerns from his admitted arrest for riding a bicycle under the\ninfluence less than a month after his 2004 DUI arrest, even though the district attorney chose not to\nprosecute that offense. This incident indicates an ongoing unwillingness or  inability to conform to\nlegal obligations. CC DC 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) also applies, as\nAppellant remains on probation from his 2004 DUI conviction. No other CC DC applies.\nApplicant submitted no evidence tending to establish any criminal conduct mitigating\ncondition, and, after considering each of them, none is supported by the evidence in the FORM.\nAccordingly, Applicant has not met his burden to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts he\nadmitted, which raise criminal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant submitted neither evidence nor other information from which any mitigating\ncondition or circumstance might be applied to lessen the security concerns raised by his pattern of\nalcohol-related criminal offenses and ongoing alcohol consumption. The record gives every\nindication that recurrence of this conduct is likely, and he submitted nothing to support a contrary\nconclusion. Applicant is a mature and educated individual who is accountable for his choices, and\nwho did not alleviate security concerns in the face of his burden to do so. For the reasons stated,\n\n7\nApplicant has not demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to\ngrant him access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines I (Psychological \nConditions), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on July 9, 2004. On April \n18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines I, J, and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 28, 2008; answered it on the \nsame day; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on April 30, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 12, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on June 13, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on July 2, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 23, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without objection. The record closed \nupon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 4, 2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of several \ndefinitions and diagnostic criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Without objection from Applicant, I took \nadministrative notice as requested. Excerpts from DSM-IV are attached to the record as \nHearing Exhibit I. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations, but she admitted \nsome of the facts alleged in the SOR during the hearing. Her admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old administrative aide for a defense contractor. She has \nworked for her current employer since July 1988 and has held a clearance since \nFebruary 1990.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in July 1964 and divorced in September 1967. She \nremarried in July 1971 and was divorced in August 1982. She had two miscarriages and \ngave birth to a stillborn son in December 1964. She graduated from college with a \nbachelor of science degree in 1997.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 91-year-old father, a retired Air Force officer, submitted a letter \nidentifying himself as a \u201cproud parent\u201d and describing Applicant\u2019s life as \u201cexemplary\u201d \n(AX A). A co-worker who has worked for the same employer for 26 years and known \nApplicant for about eight months described her as caring, considerate, and hard-\nworking (AX B). \n \n \nOn January 28, 2005, Applicant entered a hospital hear her home and place of \nemployment. In her answer to the SOR, she stated she voluntarily entered the hospital \nbecause she was feeling sad and sleepy and suffering from an upset stomach. The \nintake summary states she was referred to the hospital by her therapist (GX 5 at 19). At \nthe hearing, she testified she was referred by her therapist (Tr. 123).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe clinician who made the intake assessment at the hospital observed that \nApplicant\u2019s insight and judgment appeared to be impaired (GX 5 at 21). She was \ndischarged from the hospital on February 28, 2005, with a diagnosis of major \ndepressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; and anxiety disorder \nNOS (not otherwise specified) (GX 5 at 48). The discharge summary recites that \nApplicant found her work stressful, suffered from depression, appeared to have some \nparanoia, and had a pattern of having difficulty getting along with coworkers and \neffectively completing her job tasks for 8-10 years (GX 5 at 47-48). The prognosis was \n\u201csomewhat guarded,\u201d because her thought processes and related illness were \nlongstanding and Applicant was \u201creluctant to admit to some of the internal difficulties \nand to address them behaviorally\u201d (GX 5 at 49). \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a letter from the \ntherapist who referred her to the hospital for treatment. The therapist stated that when \nshe was treating Applicant, she observed no indications that Applicant would do \nanything to risk compromising sensitive information. On the contrary, she observed with \nApplicant reflected \u201crigid loyalty to protocol and a quite pride in her role as an adherent \nto security matters\u201d (GX 2 at 3). \n \n \nOn July 5, 2006, a security investigator contacted Applicant by telephone to \narrange an interview. At the time, the investigator had slightly less than four years of \nexperience in security investigations (Tr. 80). The investigator had Applicant\u2019s case file, \nand he knew she was a mature woman, but he did not know she lived alone (Tr. 46, \n77). The record does not reflect the investigator\u2019s age, but he obviously is much \nyounger than Applicant. The security investigator\u2019s account of the conversation with \nApplicant is significantly different from Applicant\u2019s account. \n \n \nThe investigator reported to his superiors that Applicant immediately became \n\u201cbelligerent, aggressive, and seemingly irrational\u201d when he identified himself and told \nher the purpose of his call. The investigator stated Applicant did not want the interview \nconducted at her place of employment, which is the normal practice, and he eventually \nagreed to schedule the interview at her home. According to the investigator, Applicant \naccused the investigator, her employer, and the Department of Defense of persecuting \nher, and she could not understand why she was required to divulge personal medical \ninformation to the government and her employer. She accused the investigator of \nrecording their conversation. According to the investigator, she told him she would slit \nhis throat if he revealed her personal information to anyone. The investigator testified he \nasked her if she realized she had just threatened the life of a government \nrepresentative, and she responded, \u201cYeah, I do and I\u2019m glad I did it . . . I\u2019ve been getting \nharassed by the government for a long time now.\u201d After the investigator filed the report \nof his conversation with Applicant, he was told to cancel the interview, which he did. (Tr. \n56-57, GX 4 at 1-2.) \n \n \nApplicant testified the investigator was \u201cpreying\u201d on her, and he wanted to \nconduct the interview at her home, and that he promised to be discrete. She did not \nbelieve he was a government investigator (Tr. 126-27). She testified she becomes very \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndefensive and belligerent when she is \u201cpreyed on by a male.\u201d She admitted telling the \ninvestigator she would slit his throat (Tr. 103-04). She testified she \u201cfreaked\u201d and was so \nfrightened she jumped a four-foot fence in her back yard and stayed overnight with a \nneighbor (Tr. 111). The next day she drove to another state to visit her cousin (Tr. 125). \nShe believes her security clearance is at risk because she refused to allow the \ninvestigator to interview her at home (Tr. 105, 108, 110). \n \nThe interview was rescheduled for July 20, 2006, at Applicant\u2019s place of \nemployment. The original investigator conducted the interview, with an additional \ninvestigator present. During this interview, Applicant described her personal history as \nwell as her history of medical and psychological treatment. At the end of the interview, \nthe additional investigator asked Applicant about her threat to slit the original \ninvestigator\u2019s throat. Applicant responded that she \u201cfreaked out\u201d during the telephone \nconversation, because she did not think the caller was a government investigator. She \nadmitted making the statement, denied that the threat was sincere, and expressed \nregret for saying it. She told the original investigator that if he had come to her home as \noriginally scheduled, the police would have been at her house when he arrived (Tr. 65, \n74; GX 4 at 5-6). \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied threatening the security investigator. \nWhen confronted with the discrepancy between her answer to the SOR and her \ntestimony, she stated she did not type the answer to the SOR, did not notice the denial, \nand merely signed it (Tr. 130-31). After reviewing her written response to the SOR, she \nadmitted she \u201cmust have\u201d written it, but that it was a mistake (Tr. 133).  \n \nThe Department of Defense referred Applicant to a licensed clinical psychologist \nfor evaluation on September 18, 2007. Applicant\u2019s medical history recited in the \nevaluation report recites that Applicant completed a seven-day hospitalization for \npsychiatric treatment in 1979 and the four-week treatment described above in 2005. \nThe psychologist observed that Applicant sometimes exhibits \u201cidiosyncratic thought \nprocesses.\u201d He noted that Applicant seemed to place great importance on generational \nand gender differences and was \u201cmildly critical\u201d of those of different gender and \ngenerational groups (GX 3 at 4). The psychologist made a provisional diagnosis of \npsychotic disorder; major depressive disorder recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; \nand bipolar I disorder, most recent episode unspecified, severe with psychotic features. \nHe stated his diagnosis was provisional because he did not have historical, objective \ndata, such as previous treatment records (GX 3 at 3). He concluded his evaluation with \nthe following comments: \n \nOverall, [Applicant] appears to experience some mild and transient \npsychiatric symptoms on a day-to-day basis. These include a suspicious \nstyle of perceiving events and an idiosyncratic, rigid thinking style that \nprobably does not interfere with daily functioning (though discussion with \nco-workers and supervisors would help to determine functional work \nimpairments). Likewise, [Applicant] may be subject to mild transient mood \nswings as a result of daily stressors. In reviewing [Applicant\u2019s] life events \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand psychiatric treatment episodes, it appears that during times of stress \n[Applicant\u2019s] mood swings may become more severe, and her thinking \nmay shift from mildly suspicious to more significantly distorted and \nparanoid. It is unclear from the information provided and the psychological \nevaluation whether [Applicant] has ever experienced a gross psychotic \nbreak, though her reactions as described in the DoD testimonials suggest \nthat she is capable of paranoid, distorted, and bizarre thought processes \n(GX 3 at 5). \n \nApplicant testified that this diagnosis was based on one hour of observation and that the \npsychologist also \u201chinted, very strongly, that he was bought and paid for by DOD\u201d (Tr. \n121-22).  \n \n \nApplicant testified she began receiving therapy and psychiatric care after \nmenopause because it caused chemical reactions in her body (Tr. 103). She testified \nher supervisors and colleagues know she has been taking antidepressants for many \nyears (Tr. 107).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted an assessment by the psychologist who has been treating \nher for the past three years, disagreeing with the government psychologist\u2019s \nassessment. The cover letter, signed by a registered nurse but approved by Applicant\u2019s \npsychologist, states that the \u201chighly un-specific, unusual cluster of diagnoses\u201d submitted \nby the government psychologist is inconsistent with what Applicant\u2019s psychologist has \nobserved over a three-year period. Her psychologist describes her as \u201ca woman who \nhas been actively engaged in a recovery process from a major depressive disorder.\u201d He \nfurther opined that she is \u201cnot homicidal, overtly psychotic, threatening, and does not \nshow evidence of any symptoms of bipolar disorder\u201d (AX E at 1).  \n \n \nThe medical records submitted by Applicant include an evaluation by a clinical \nneuropsychologist in October 2005. This evaluation found no signs of dementia, but it \nfound weakness in executive functioning. The psychologist explained: \n \nWhile deficits in executive functions can result from brain injury, especially \nin the frontal lobes, they are also seen in patients with organic mental \ndisorders such as major depression, OCD, and psychosis, even if the \npatient\u2019s acute symptoms have resolved. The nature of [Applicant\u2019s] \nexecutive deficits appears to fit this pattern, and consequently they reflect \nmore of a functional disorder rather than the sign of dementia or brain \ndisease.  \n \nThe neuropsychologist concluded that Applicant would be more responsive to \nmedication than therapy (AX E at 82).  \n \nApplicant currently is taking citalopram, labeled as a \u201cselective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitor used to treat depression\u201d (AX C), and seroquel, labeled as an \n\u201catypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder\u201d (AX D). She \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntestified she takes seroquel \u201cfor sleeping\u201d and has been taking it since her \nhospitalization in 2005 (Tr. 115-17).  \n \n \nThe progress notes from Applicant\u2019s psychologist reflect that on April 17, 2007, \nshe felt \u201cbeaten up\u201d by her employer, politicians, and her country, and she \u201chates\u201d them \nall (AX E at 25). On February 12, 2008, she was agitated and \u201coff the wall\u201d at work after \nwatching a movie the night before, and her friends at work told her to \u201cback off\u201d (AX E at \n20). On April 29, 2008, she expressed concern about the government psychologist\u2019s \nevaluation of September 2007, and she accused the government psychologist of \nmaking suggestive gestures toward her that she rejected (AX E at 19). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I (Psychological Conditions) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that, in February 2005, Applicant was diagnosed by a \npsychologist with (1) major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic \nfeatures; and (2) generalized anxiety disorder that resulted in impaired judgment and \nimpaired insight (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges that, in September 2007, she was \ndiagnosed by a licensed clinical psychologist with (1) psychotic disorder, not otherwise \nspecified; (2) major depressive disorder recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; and \n(3) bipolar I disorder, most recent episode unspecified, severe with psychotic features.  \n \nThe security concern under Guideline I is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental health counseling. \nA potentially disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \n\u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness that \nis not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to emotionally \nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n\n \n8 \n \n \n28(a). A potentially disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201can opinion by a duly \nqualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition not covered \nunder any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \n\u00b6 28(b). The diagnoses from February 2005 and September 2007 raise both \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated if \u201cthe identified condition \nis readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(a). Applicant appears to have \nscrupulously complied with her treatment plans. The issue is with the first prong, \nwhether her condition is \u201creadily controllable with treatment.\u201d The discharge summary \nfrom her hospitalization in 2005 was guarded, and her subsequent behavior raises \ndoubts about whether her psychological condition is \u201creadily controllable.\u201d  \nThe episode with the security investigator in July 2006 occurred because \nApplicant felt threatened by a \u201cmale predator.\u201d Based on all the evidence and my \nobservations of her demeanor and the security investigator\u2019s demeanor, I believe she \nactually felt threatened, was terrified, and was acting defensively when she threatened \nto slit his throat. What the investigator may have actually said appears to have been \nfiltered through her concern with generational and gender differences and her fear of \ntelephone calls from unidentified males. I do not believe the investigator made \nsuggestive comments, but I do believe Applicant\u2019s fear was real, and she reacted \naccordingly. \nApplicant\u2019s agitated and \u201coff the wall\u201d behavior after watching a movie also raises \ndoubts whether her condition is fully controllable. Her problems are further indicated by \nher suspicion that the government psychologist conducting the evaluation in September \n2007 made suggestive gestures toward her. Her own psychologist describes her as \n\u201cengaged in a recovery process,\u201d but he does not opine that she is recovered. Based on \nall the evidence, I conclude Applicant has not carried her burden of establishing the first \nprong of AG \u00b6 29(a). \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered \na counseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(b). Applicant is voluntarily receiving \ntreatment. Her condition appears to be \u201camenable to treatment,\u201d but not fully \ncontrollable. Her psychologist believes she is engaged in the recovery process, but he \ndid not offer a prognosis. I conclude Applicant has not carried her burden of establishing \nAG \u00b6 29(b). \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nFinally, security concerns can be mitigated by a \u201crecent opinion by a duly \nqualified mental health professional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the \nU.S. Government that an individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, \nand has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation.\u201d AG \u00b6 29(c). The evaluation in \nSeptember 2007, although it is a provisional diagnosis, falls short of concluding her \ncondition is under control or in remission, and it indicates the possibility of more severe \nepisodes during times of stress. I conclude AG \u00b6 29(c) is not established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant threatened to slit the throat of a security investigator \nif he disclosed any information about her (SOR \u00b6 2.a).  \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nDepartment Counsel did not present any evidence or request that I take \nadministrative notice of any federal, state, or local statute criminalizing her conduct. I \nam satisfied, however, that Applicant did not entertain the mens rea required to \ncriminalize her conduct. She did not believe the investigator was an agent of the \ngovernment, she perceived a threat, and she reacted defensively. I conclude no \ndisqualifying conditions are raised under this guideline. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe same conduct alleged under Guideline J is also alleged under this guideline. \nThe concern under this guideline is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack \nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(c). A disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201ccredible \nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not \nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \n\n \n10 \n \n \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d). Applicant\u2019s threat to kill the security \ninvestigator reflects impaired judgment sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d), shifting \nthe burden to her to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s threat was serious and recent, and it reflects impaired judgment. I conclude \nthis mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(d). Applicant has generally acknowledged her psychological problems, obtained \ntreatment, and complied with her treatment program. While her psychologist believes \nshe is \u201cengaged in a recovery process,\u201d she is not yet recovered, as evidenced by her \nrecent perception that the government psychologist made suggestive gestures toward \nher. I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). Applicant has taken positive steps to deal with her psychological problems, and \nshe has made significant progress, even though her vulnerability is not yet eliminated. I \nconclude this mitigating condition is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has worked for a defense contractor and held a clearance for many \nyears. She appears dedicated and proud of her work. She is unlikely to intentionally \nviolate any security rules. However, there is substantial evidence that she suffers from \nconditions beyond her control that affect her perception of events and impair her \njudgment and insight.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines I, J, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct, but she has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on psychological conditions and personal \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 16, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 20, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, including his assertions that he was\nunaware of his outstanding indebtedness and that he subsequently made efforts to remedy his\nfinancial problems. In that regard, Applicant takes issue with the fact that the Judge\u2019s Formal\nFindings did not give him credit for twelve of eighteen debts he had paid off and that two additional\ndebts involved the same account.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish the Judge erred.   \nAs part of his brief, Applicant attaches documentary evidence which he submitted to the\nJudge and also new documentary evidence which indicates that he has now paid off a significant\namount of his outstanding debt, including $28,951 owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  The Board\nmay not consider the new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  It was not before the Judge\nand, therefore, does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007). \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had a lengthy and serious\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations and had provided false information about his\nindebtedness in response to two different questions on his security clearance application.  At the time\nof the hearing, Applicant still had a significant amount of overdue indebtedness that he was trying\nto clear up.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The\nJudge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of\nthe disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant as to a number of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge\n\n3\nreasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating to 1990. In January 2006, he deliberately\nomitted material information from his security clearance application (SCA) when he answered \u201cNO\u201d\nto both questions in section 28 requiring information about having been over 180 days delinquent\non any debts in the last 7 years, and any debts over 90 days delinquent. Applicant continues to deny\nhe falsified the SCA. After receiving the Statement of Reasons in early 2007, Applicant paid or\nsettled with four of the listed creditors. Applicant\u2019s financial problems and his deliberate omissions\nhave not been mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn March 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as revised by Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) made effective on September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant. The SOR indicated that based on financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal\nconduct (Guideline E), DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct\nproceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. On\nJune 21, 2007, Applicant signed his response to the SOR. His answer was notarized on June 27,\n2007. He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 3, 2007. This case, originally set for hearing at 12:00\np.m. on October 11, 2007, was postponed on that day because the case scheduled for the morning\ndid not conclude until approximately 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon of October 11. On October 24, 2007,\nthe case was rescheduled for November 14, 2007. The Government submitted nine exhibits.\nApplicant testified. He submitted one exhibit (AE A) containing documents verifying payment of\nsome of the listed debts. The exhibit was marked AE A and admitted in evidence. Based on my\nbelief that Applicant would be more successful in marshaling his documents to demonstrate which\ndebts he acted on and which debts needed action, I returned the exhibit to him. The stipulated\ndeadline to submit additional information was December 6, 2007. Applicant agreed to return the\nexhibit with a position statement providing additional responses to the personal conduct allegation\n(Tr. 87). \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits have been remarked, beginning with a one-page e-mail (AE B) he\nsubmitted on December 11, 2007. He also returned a group of documents that have been divided into\ntwo groups, character statements and correspondence from some of the listed and unlisted creditors,\nand payment receipts. The character evidence is admitted as AE C, and the creditor documentation\nis admitted as AE D. Each specific page of AE D has been identified as AE D1 through AE D16 for\nreference purposes. AE A has been withdrawn asa an exhibit because Applicant\u2019s documents have\nbeen reorganized in AE B through AE D16.The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 21, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn July 31, 2007, the government filed a Motion to Amend the SOR by adding an additional\nallegation to paragraph 3 of the SOR. At the hearing, Applicant denied the Motion because he\nclaimed his address was different in the 2001 and 2002 time period. The allegation refers to\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cNO\u201d answer to question 29 of the January 4, 2006 security clearance application (SCA)\nrequiring information whether he was a party to a public record civil court action not listed elsewhere\nin the SCA. His security clearance application (SCA) (GE 1) reflects he lived at the stated address\n(Tr. 8) for nine years, and specifically during 2001 and 2002 when he would have received the\ncorrespondence from the two creditors. One of those is identified in subparagraph 1.e. of the SOR.\nThe motion is granted and subparagraph 2.c. is added to the other allegations under subparagraph\n2 of the SOR. \n\n D3 is a check dated May 26, 2006, made out for $423.15 to one of these unlisted creditors. The drawer of the\n1\ncheck is not Applicant.  \n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 62 years old has been employed at the same work location since May 1997.\nApplicant was promoted from millright to foreman in 1999. He seeks a security clearance. \n\u008e 1.a. Applicant agreed that he petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 1990, although\nhe suggested the petition may have been filed before the date identified in the SOR. Applicant opted\nfor bankruptcy after he discovered he could not afford the mortgage. The only debts he recalled that\nwere in the bankruptcy were the house and a car. He indicated an intention to contact the bankruptcy\ncourt to uncover more information about the bankruptcy, however, no information was provided. \nThe remaining allegations of paragraph 1 of the SOR are 16 debts totaling $28,904.00. The\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) lien (1.b.) was imposed in March 1992. The IRS filed a wage\ngarnishment (1.q.) in October 2005 to satisfy this lien. Three of the other debts became delinquent\nin 2000. Some became delinquent in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. Regarding where the money is\ncoming from presently to pay the debts, Applicant\u2019s monthly pay is approximately $3,000.00 with\na monthly remainder of about $150.00 a month. His wife who is retired and financially secure, is\npaying most of the remaining debts from her resources (Tr. 54). The creditors or collection agencies\nin subparagraphs 1.c., 1.k., 1.l., 1.p., 1.q., and 1.s. have been paid or removed as creditors. Applicant\nhas also settled with the second and third creditors (not listed in the SOR) of GE 4 (credit bureau\nreport dated February 17, 2006).  \n1\n\u008e Applicant did not file federal forms for two years, one of the those year was 1992. An IRS\ntax lien (1.b.) of $2,155.00 was levied against him in 1992 for failure to pay taxes. He worked out\nan agreement with the IRS that required him to pay $100.00 a month until the lien was paid. (GE 7)\nWhen Applicant stopped the payments, the IRS garnished (1.q.) his wages in October 2005 for\nfailure to pay off the 1992 lien. \n\u008e Applicant owes a department store on a delinquent credit card account amounting to\n$476.00 (1.c.). This debt was reported delinquent in March 2000. Applicant blamed his former wife\non for allowing this debt to fall into arrears. He settled the account for $380.00 (D11, D12, D13).\n\u008e The original creditor placed this account for collection in approximately September 2000.\nThe delinquent amount is $1,511.00 (1.d.). Applicant testified he called this collection agency to\nsettle the account (Tr. 32). D4 reflects an offer to settlement, but no evidence indicating the debt was\npaid.  \n\u008e This account ($15,606.00) (1.e.) was charged off in October 2000. Applicant wrecked this\nvehicle, and never received a letter from the bank that he owed a deficiency balance. He speculates\nhis former wife may have never told him that he still owed money on the car. No additional\ninformation was provided. \n\u008e The two accounts in 1.f. and 1.g. ($227.00) have been combined because they are held by\nthe same collection service. Applicant does not know who the creditor is. (Tr. 33-34)\n\n4\n\u008e Applicant testified he contacted the collection service for a settlement (1.h.) of the account\n$1,106.00 (Tr. 34).\n\u008e Applicant does not know the identity of the original creditor of this account (1.i.)\namounting to $450.00. (Id.)\n\u008e Applicant called the collection service for a settlement figure (1.j.) to close the account\n(Tr. 35).\n\u008e The accounts in 1.k. and 1.l. have been combined since both are held by the same\ncollection agency. The total past due amount is $262.00. The documentation (D14) verifies\nApplicant paid both accounts. \n\u008e The delinquent debt of $1,132.00 (1.m) was transferred from the original creditor in\nNovember 2004. D8 discloses a letter from the collection agency offering to settle the account for\n$462.93. There is an official check at the bottom of D8, however, the poor quality of the copy makes\nthe check unreadable.\n\u008e A settlement figure of $480.00 (1.n.) has been proposed to Applicant. He predicted\npayment of the settlement in the next two weeks (Tr. 35). No additional information was provided.\n\u008e The telephone account ($243.00) has not been addressed (Tr. 36).\n\u008e The wage garnishment for child support (1.p.) was levied in error. Applicant provided\ndocumentation that all money was refunded (Tr. 37). Applicant was arrested for not paying child\nsupport in 1994. He eliminated the arrearage in April 1997 (GE 7), and provided documentation the\ngarnishment order was in error (D10).\n\u008e The IRS garnished Applicant\u2019s wages (1.q.) in October 2005 to satisfy the lien that had\nbeen filed in 1992. He satisfied the garnishment. \n\u008e Applicant claims he paid the telephone account (Tr. 38) (1.r.). Applicant\u2019s documentation\n(D1) indicates an offer to settle at 60% for $164.03 was made by the collection agency, but no\ndocumentation indicating the account was settled. \n\u008e Applicant is certain he paid this telephone account (1.s.) in June 2007 (Tr. 38). His\ntestimony is supported by bank ledger indicating the debt was pais in June 2007 (D16).\nGE 9 is a Final Judgment and Execution Withholding Order signed by a county judge on July\n24, 2002. The order memorializes a payment arrangement between a credit card company (seconds\npage, GE 4) an Applicant that required Applicant to pay a judgment of $1,005.61 in installments\nbeginning with a payment of $150.00 by July 15, 2002, followed by monthly payments of $150.00\nuntil the principal was paid. \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s documentation (AE D) indicates he paid or settled with four of the 16 listed\ncreditors . After subtracting the total repayment amounts to the erroneous child support, and the\nsatisfied federal lien, Applicant still owes 12 creditors $22, 398.00. \nApplicant attributed the false answers to question 28 of his SCA (subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.)\nin January 2006 to a constantly changing work schedule, a short period of time to complete and\nreturn the SCA, and going through a rough divorce that was granted in August 2005 (Tr. 39).\nHowever, when he filled out his SCA (GE 1) in January 2006, he knew he had delinquent debts and\nthat he had a car repossessed (Tr. 48-50). Applicant remembered he had a older version of the SCA\n(GE 2), so, he copied the information from the older version to GE 1 (Tr. 40). Yet, he could not\nexplain why he did not transfer some of the information from the older form (GE 1) to the newer\nSCA (GE 1) (Tr. 44-48). Applicant does not believe he made the same number of mistakes in\nanswering the questions of other sections of his SCA (GE 1) as he made in the financial section of\nthe application (Tr. 51). Regarding subparagraph 2.c., he answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 29 of the same\nSCA because he contends he was unaware of any civil suits against him in the last seven years, and\neven though his correct address appears on the documents (Tr 51).\nAfter he received the SOR (circa March 2007), Applicant returned to his security department\nand corrected the mistakes in GE 1 (Tr. 51-53). \nIn Applicant\u2019s one-page statement (AE B), he described his disconsolate feelings during the\nhearing on November 2007. His son-in-law had just died on October 27, 2007. His mother-in-law,\nwho was sick, passed away three days after the hearing. Applicant reiterated that living with an\nalcoholic and experiencing a contentious divorce created medical problems which contributed to not\nproviding correct answers on the SCA in January 2006. Having weighed Applicant\u2019s testimonial and\nrecorded explanations regarding the omitted information, specifically his understanding of the\nimportance of the SCA, I find Applicant deliberately omitted information from GE 1. \nA supervisor and close friend of Applicant for nine years believes Applicant is a trustworthy\nindividual. The supervisor recalled Applicant, in his job as supervisor of heavy equipment, was\nprovided with confidential information about employees, budgetary matters and launch operations,\nand always conducted himself in a professional manner. The supervisor\u2019s family and Applicant\u2019s\nfamily are very friendly. \nThe facilities control director has known Applicant professionally since 1997. The director\nquickly learned that Applicant was concerned with safety issues in the facility, and sought advice\nfrom Applicant on how to make the facility a safer place. The director had to lay Applicant off\nbecause of economic issues, but brought him back and promoted him to manager in 1999, where he\nhas remained. The director recalled that Applicant received a safety award in 2002 for making\nchanges to promote safety in the shop locations assigned.  The director is aware of no adverse\ninformation that would have a negative impact on Applicant\u2019s security clearance application.  \nA social friend of Applicant for eight years, who knew about his former wife\u2019s alcoholism,\nconsiders Applicant an honest and trustworthy person. \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for October 2001 to September 2007 have been\noutstanding. \n\n6\nPOLICIES\nThe AG contains disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should\nbe given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must\nbe considered in every case along with the general factors of the whole person concept. However,\nthe conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede\nthe Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nThe failure to pay debts in a timely manner places an individual at risk of committing acts\nof poor judgment to generate funds.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nConduct involving questionable judgment, dishonesty or unwillingness to follow the rules\ncan raise doubts about a person\u2019s trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant has encountered recurrent financial problems since he was discharged from his\ndebts under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in June 1990. Less than two years later, an IRS tax lien\nwas filed against him in March 1992 for failing to pay taxes. In 1994, Applicant was arrested for\nfailing to pay child support. He did not catch up on the arrearage in support until April 1997.\nDelinquent debts began appearing on Applicant\u2019s credit report starting in February 2000 with the\ndepartment store debt. The number of delinquent debts continued to grow until March 2007 when\nApplicant owed $28,904.00 to 16 creditors. The number, duration and amount of debt falls within\nthe purview of FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and\nFC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant\u2019s federal tax problems also\ntrigger the application of FC DC 19.g. (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax\n\n7\nreturns required or the fraudulent filing of the same) even though the lien was filed about 15 years\nago. In October 2005, the IRS had to garnish Applicant\u2019s wages because he did repay the lien as\npromised. \nFC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment) is inapplicable as Applicant still\nowes 13 creditors almost $22,400.00, and he tried to conceal various elements of his indebtedness,\nincluding repossessions and judgments.\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control) applies to a limited degree since 1997 when Applicant began his employment at\nthis facility. But, while Applicant was laid off in the late 1990s, he has enjoyed uninterrupted\nemployment since 2002. Though his former wife may have complicated his financial obligations\nuntil their divorce in August 2005, she had little to do with (1) a federal lien filed against him in\nMarch 1992 for failing to file his federal return and pay federal income taxes (2) his child support\nproblem with another former wife in 1994, and (3) the garnishment of his wages in October 2005\nby IRS for not complying with his repayment agreement to pay off the 1992 federal tax lien.\nI have carefully evaluated FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol) and FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts). There is no evidence of counseling. Applicant knew he had delinquent\ndebts when he submitted his SCA (GE 1) in January 2006. Though one of the listed debts (and three\nunlisted debts) have been paid or settled, action was not taken on the debts until after Applicant\nreceived the SOR in March 2007. The mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC 20.b., 20.c., and\n20.d. is insufficient to satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion under the FC guideline.\nSubparagraphs 1.c., 1.k., 1.l., 1.p., 1.q., and 1.s. are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. The remaining\nallegations are found against him.\nRegarding the personal conduct allegations relating to Applicant\u2019s deliberate omissions of\nmaterial information from his SCA in January 2006, Applicant has put forth a number of\nexplanations for the omitted information from health problems to deaths in the family, to a lack of\nreasonable time to complete the SCA, to not really knowing why he omitted the information. Though\nall the explanations could have played a part in causing him to omit the required information on the\napplication, the most reasonable explanation, and one he denies, is that he deliberately concealed\ninformation about his debts over the years. He knew when he filled out the form in January 2006 that\nhe had delinquent debts. He may not have known about all the debts but he knew about some of the\ndebts. Since he knew about some of the debts, his decision to conceal must have been motivated, at\nleast in part, by his decision to conceal. After he received the SOR, he went to his security\ndepartment and entered the correct information. PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire to determine security clearance\neligibility) applies. \nThe PC guideline has three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case, but all three must be removed from consideration as Applicant continues\nto deny he deliberated falsified the SCA. PC MC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith\n\n8\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts)\ndoes not apply based on Applicant\u2019s ongoing disavowal that he exhibited dishonesty on the security\nform. PC MC 17.b. (the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or\nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal\ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process.\nUpon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully) is inapplicable as no one advised or suggested to Applicant to falsify\nhis security form. \nPC MC 17.c. (the offense was minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply in view of\nthe recency of the omission. His continuing belief he did not falsify  raises lingering doubt about his\ntrustworthiness and judgment. Subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. are found against Applicant.\nWhole Person Model\nThe adverse conclusions under the FC and PC guidelines support the same outcome under\nthe whole person model. Applicant was 45 years old when he discharged certain debts in 1990. In\nthe remainder of the 1990s, he encountered tax problems that were not resolved until October 2005.\nHe was arrested for failing to pay child support in 1994. His other debts began falling delinquent in\n2000, and by early 2007, the debts had grown to almost $29,000.00. Applicant was 61 years old\nbefore he began to take any action to pay off his overdue debt. That action was clearly influenced\nby his receipt of the SOR. It took him about 13 years to pay off his federal lien. The government had\nto garnish his wages in October 2005 to obtain the $1,800.00 balance due on the lien. Finally,\nApplicant deliberately tried to conceal his financial problems. Having considered the entire record,\ntogether with Applicant\u2019s reputation among his coworkers and supervisors, and his outstanding job\nperformance, Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence does not outweigh the aggravating evidence under the\nFC and PC guidelines.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):AGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1.a.\n \nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor the Applicant.\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.j. \nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst the Applicant,\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nFor the Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.r.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.s.\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On March 12, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  The SOR was\nsubsequently amended on the motion of the government to add security concerns raised under\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 6, 2007,\nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel submitted a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\nclearance decision under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We\nreverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant the clearance.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings:\nApplicant is 54 years of age, obtained Master\u2019s Degree and a Ph.D. from an American\nuniversity, and is employed by a defense contractor.  His brother and sister are citizens of and reside\nin Iran.  Applicant\u2019s brother is 61 years old and is a retired truck driver for a tobacco company.  His\nsister is a 69-year-old housewife.  Applicant has not visited Iran since 1999, as his parents are now\nboth deceased.  He has no intention of visiting Iran in the future.\nApplicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis his Iranian siblings.  He would report any such\nattempt at coercion to the appropriate U.S. authorities.\nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for 32 years, and has been a U.S. citizen for nearly 18 years.\nHe is married to a German national, who has applied for U.S. citizenship.  Their five-year-old\ndaughter is a native-born American.  Applicant has renounced his Iranian citizenship and has\nsurrendered his expired Iranian passport.  His loyalty is only to the U.S.\nIran is a state that sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran\nsince 1980.  It is a theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power\nstructures, and ultimate political authority is vested in a learned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and\nworsening human rights record presents a further threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians\nemigrated to the U.S. in 1979, after the Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind\nfamily members in Iran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political prisoners for\nharassment purposes.\nB.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  We review matters of law de\nnovo.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in not applying Guideline C Disqualifying\nCondition 10(d), and that the error is harmful because the security concerns raised under the\nCondition are not otherwise mitigated.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument in this regard has merit.\nSecurity concerns are raised under Disqualifying Condition 10(d) when there is \u201cany\nstatement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States . . .\u201d  In his signed,\nsworn statement to the government\u2019s investigator, Applicant stated: \u201cI see my loyalty to the U.S. and\nIran as equal . . .\u201d   He also stated that a potential conflict between Iran and U.S. could possibly\n1\naffect his personal feelings and that he would have to evaluate the situation on a case-by-case basis:\n\u201cIf the program to which I was assigned at any given time became too difficult for my conscience\nto bear, I would reserve the right to withdraw my participation.\u201d   While Applicant later contended\n2\nthat his sentiments toward Iran had changed because his parents were now deceased, his signed\nsworn statement had in fact been executed well after their deaths.   Additionally, at the hearing\n3\nApplicant expressed ambiguous sentiments and was unable to say whether he was willing to bear\narms against Iran: \u201cWell, this is a, you know, that\u2019s a very hypothetical situation, and I don\u2019t think\nI can address that, you know, because I don\u2019t think that this is something that is going to happen.\u201d4\nIn light of the foregoing evidence, it was error for the Judge not to apply Disqualifying\nCondition 10(d).  The error is harmful because the security concerns raised under the condition are\nnot otherwise mitigated.  The only finding of fact that directly addressed the concern was the Judge\u2019s\n\nDecision at 3.  The Judge\u2019s other findings with respect to Guideline C addressed Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S.,\n5\nwhich were present prior to his making the statement, and the circumstances relating to his renunciation of Iranian\ncitizenship and the surrender of his expired passport.\nDecision at 5.\n6\n4\nconclusory statement: \u201cHis loyalty is only to the U.S.\u201d   The Judge did not apply any Mitigating\n5\nConditions relevant to the concern.  Nor did he engage in any analysis under the whole-person\nfactors, stating only that: \u201cThe totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at\nlength above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation under the \u2018whole person concept.\u2019\u201d6\nAccordingly, with respect to the Guideline C allegations the Judge failed to consider an important\naspect of the case and failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions.  His\nfavorable decision under that Guideline is not sustainable, in that it is arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law.\nBecause the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision under Guideline C must be\nreversed, the Board need not reach the issues raised by Department Counsel as to Guideline B. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E.

He has lived in the U.S. for 32 years, and has been a U.S. citizen for nearly 18 years.  He\nis married to a German national, who has applied for U.S. citizenship.  Their five year old daughter\nis a native-born American.  The Applicant\u2019s brother and sister live in Iran.  His 61 year old brother\nis a retired truck driver, and his 69 year old sister is a housewife.  He has not visited Iran since 1999,\nas his parents are both deceased, and he has no intention of visiting Iran in the future.  As the\nApplicant has \u201clongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\u201d it is unlikely that he \u201cwill be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of . . . [his foreign relative] . . . and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 30, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on April 25, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued\non May 3, 2007, and the case was heard on June 14, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary\nevidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence in\nhis own behalf.  At the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR to add Guideline C,\nForeign Preference.  There being no objection by the Applicant, the SOR was so amended.  The\ntranscript (TR) was received on June 27, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence militate against the granting of a security\nclearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of Guideline B, Foreign Influence, but\ndenies those alleged under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 54 years of age, obtained Master\u2019s Degree and a Ph.D. from\nan American university, and is employed by a defense contractor which seeks a security clearance\non behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n1.a~1.c.  The Applicant\u2019s brother and sister are citizens of and reside in Iran (TR at page 22\n\n3\nline 22 to page 23 line 6).  His 61 year old brother is retired, and was a truck driver for \u201ca tobacco\ncompany\u201d (TR at page 38 line 15 to page 39 line 5).  His 69 year old sister is a housewife (TR at\npage 42 line 21 to page 43 line 1).  The Applicant has not visited Iran since 1999, eight years ago,\nas his parents are now both deceased (TR at page 23 line 17 to page 24 line 7, and at page 36 line\n19 to page 37 line 2).  Furthermore, he has no intention of visiting Iran in the future (Id).\nThe Applicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis his Iranian siblings (TR at page 48 line 17\nto page 50 line 3).  He would report any such attempt at coercion to the appropriate U.S. authorities\n(Id).\n\n4\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant has lived in the U.S. for 32 years, and has been a U.S. citizen for nearly 18\nyears (TR at page 22 lines 10~22).  He is married to a German national, who has applied for U.S.\ncitizenship (TR at page 27 line 11 to page 30 line 8).  Their five year old daughter is a native-born\nAmerican (Id).\n2.a.~2.c.  The Applicant has renounced his Iranian citizenship, and has surrendered his\nexpired Iranian passport (TR at page 24 lines 8~24, at page 37 line 19 to page 38 line 4, and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) E and F).  His loyalty is only to the U.S. (Id).\nAs the Applicant has Iranian siblings, I must also consider the country of Iran.  Iran is a state\nthat sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.  It is a\ntheocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and\nultimate political authority is vested in a learned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and worsening\nhuman rights record presents a further threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians emigrated to\nthe U.S. in 1979, after their Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind family members\nin Iran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political prisoners for harassment\npurposes.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\n\n5\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, maintained an expired Iranian passport.  The first disqualifying\ncondition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there was an \"exercise of any right .\n. . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .  This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered, however, by the second and fifth\nmitigating conditions.  \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d\nand \u201cthe passport has been . . . surrendered to the cognizant security authority . . .\u201d  Furthermore, the\nApplicant has not only \u201cexpressed a willingness to renounce,\u201d but has renounced his Iranian\ncitizenship.\nThe Applicant's siblings are citizens of and reside in Iran.  The first and second disqualifying\nconditions under Foreign Influence are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential\nconflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d\nUnder the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first and second\nmitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother and sister is \u201csuch\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof . . . [his siblings] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  The last 32 years of his life, and his immediate\nfamily are all connected with the U.S.\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation\n\n6\nunder the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d (AppXs B~D).  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B and C are\nfound for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn B. Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe foreign influence concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s 64-year-old brother Z(a resident citizen\nof Turkey) have been sufficiently mitigated. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s clear intention to keep\nand use his foreign passport (which does not expire until June 2011) has not been mitigated.\nClearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n AE A (program manager\u2019s character statement) was admitted in evidence and turned over to Applicant so he\n1\ncould make copies of the exhibit for the parties. Applicant faxed the exhibit to Department Counsel shortly after the\nhearing. Department Counsel provided the exhibit to me on September 13, 2007. \n2\nOn April 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as reissued through Change 4\nthereto, dated April 20, 1999, with revised Adjudicative Guidelines implemented on September 1,\n2006, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) based on the foreign influence guideline (Guideline B)\nand the foreign preference guideline (Guideline C) indicating why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied or revoked. On May 2, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 20, 2007. On August 20, 2007, this case was set for\nhearing on September 12, 2007. The Government submitted two exhibits (GE 1-2), and requested\nme to take official notice of government documents. Those documents have been identified on pages\n15 through 17 of the transcript (Tr.). Applicant submitted 3 exhibits (AE A-C)  Testimony was taken\n1\nfrom Applicant. The transcript was received on September 26, 2005.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR raises a security concern under foreign influence (Guideline B) based on the fact\nthat Applicant\u2019s 64-old brother, employed as a sound engineer for a private firm, is a resident citizen\nof Turkey. The SOR also raises a security concern under foreign preference (Guideline C) based on\nApplicant\u2019s exercise of dual citizenship, his use of his Turkish passport, his renewal and use of his\nTurkish passport, and his voting in a Turkish election in 2002 after he became a naturalized citizen\nand resident of the United States (U.S.). \nApplicant is a 51-year-old software developer who was born in Turkey, and immigrated to\nthe U.S. in 1980 on a green card and student permit. He has been employed as a software developer\nby his current employer since February 2005.\nApplicant was born in Turkey in August 1956. His father, who died when Applicant was 15\nyears old, was a mathematics professor for a Turkish technical university. When Applicant was 24\nyears old, he immigrated to the U.S. for graduate studies in engineering. Two years later while in a\nU.S. graduate school in 1982, he met his wife, a student in the same field. Applicant received a\nMasters of Science degree in September 1984 and a Ph.D computer engineering in May 1989.\nDuring the time he was studying for both degrees, he taught undergraduate and graduate courses. He\nalso conducted research for a large corporation, and worked as a research and teaching assistant. \nAfter deciding to leave the teaching profession in 1993, Applicant worked for several\ninternational or U.S. companies as a software engineer or systems engineer. He received his U.S.\ncitizenship in July 2000, and his wife received her citizenship in August of the same year. He\nobtained a U.S. passport in August 2000. \n\n3\nWhen he completed his security clearance application (SCA) in February 2005, Applicant\ndisclosed his dual citizenship and possession of a Turkish passport that was issued to him in July\n2001, with an expiration date of January 2006. Applicant explained on his SCA that use of the\nTurkish passport to visit his family enabled him to avoid fees and bureaucracy. \nApplicant was interviewed about his dual citizenship by an investigator in May 2006. His\nchief reason for retaining the passport was to see his elderly mother and his brother with high-blood\npressure. Applicant also noted his close, personal relationship with his mother and his brother. While\nhis mother passed away in May 2007, Applicant still maintains a close relationship with his brother,\ncalling him about once a month. As noted in the previous paragraph, Applicant used his Turkish\npassport to save time, fees, and lengthy steps through the customs division. He also mentioned that\nit was easier for citizens, as opposed to non-citizens to receive everyday services in Turkey. As an\nexample, Applicant explained that if his mother had to be placed in a nursing home, the appropriate\nTurkish officials would be more amenable to making arrangements with citizens of Turkey than non-\ncitizens. Applicant extended his Turkish passport in June 2006, and indicated he intends to keep his\nTurkish passport due to his family situation. Applicant told the investigator he had traveled to Turkey\non several occasions to visit his mother and brother. The dates of travel were 1997, twice in 2000,\n2001, 2002, and 2004. Applicant made two additional trips in 2006, and May 2007, when his mother\npassed. He stated he would be willing to give up his dual citizenship as of a condition of receiving\na security clearance. Later in the interview, Applicant stated he would renounce his passport if it was\na condition to receiving a security clearance. \nThe circumstances under which Applicant voted in a Turkish election in 2002 occurred when\nhe was about to exit Turkey through the airport. The Turkish government set up voting booths in\nlocations at the airport where individuals passed on their way out of the country. Applicant thought\nthere was a law where all Turkish citizens had to vote. While he acknowledged poor judgment by\nvoting, he was not working at a job requiring a security clearance. \nThe corporate security officer for Applicant\u2019s employer testified that her review of the human\nresource records reflects Applicant is trustworthy, dependable, and very conscientious about security,\neven though he does not have a security clearance. He has always advised her about his trips to\nforeign countries, and taken the requisite security briefings addressing travel abroad. \nApplicant\u2019s program manager has known Applicant professionally since February 2005. He\nwrote a character statement indicating that he considers Applicant a model employee based on his\ntechnical competence and willingness to assist other employees in completing projects in a timely\nfashion. \nApplicant and his wife are naturalized citizens, and both have pledged allegiance to the U.S.\nThey love to travel and enjoy the cultural activities the U.S. has to offer. He and his wife are socially\nconscious while showing concern for the less fortunate. He is the typical naturalized citizen who has\nfamily members abroad that he goes to visit. None of his family members have ever been employed\nby the Turkish government. Applicant opines that after reviewing his contributions to the U.S. over\nthe last 25 years in the context of the whole person model, he should receive access to classified\ninformation. \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or interests, or is vulnerable to pressure by any foreign interest. The identity of the foreign\ncountry should be considered to determine whether it is known to target American citizens or is\nassociated with terrorism. \nForeign Preference (FP)\nWhen an individual acts in a way that indicates a preference for a foreign country over the\nU.S., then he or she may make decisions that are harmful to the U.S. \nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence (FI)\nA security concern is raised under the foreign influence guideline when the individual\u2019s\nforeign contacts, ties and/or financial interests may be manipulated to help a foreign entity in a way\nthat is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure by any foreign interest. Applicant\u2019s brother\n\n As noted in Findings of Fact, Applicant also traveled to the country in May 2007 for the funeral of his 85-year-\n2\nold mother. \n5\nis a resident citizen of Turkey. Applicant has traveled to Turkey in 1997 or 1998, twice in 2000,\n2001, 2002, 2004, and/or 2006.  FI disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family\n2\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion) applies. Applicant has close contacts with his brother as he had\nwith his mother before she passed away in May 2007. Applicant maintains that relationship through\nmonthly telephone calls because he is concerned about his brother\u2019s health. \nThe impending legal matters that Applicant and his brother must address should also be\nconsidered a reason for the close relationship. When their mother died in May 2007, she left two\nhouses (the house where she lived and also a summer house) to both sons. Applicant indicated he\nis entitled to half of that real estate or approximately $150,000.00. I conclude the monetary value of\nthe real estate to be a substantial financial interest, and even though the inheritance is unalleged in\nthe SOR. FI DC 7.e. (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or\nin a foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation) applies. The government has met its burden of establishing Applicant\u2019s\nheightened risk for foreign influence. \nOnce the government\u2019s initial burden is established by substantial evidence, the burden shifts\nto the applicant to establish through extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances that he or\nqualifies for security clearance access. The heightened risk of foreign influence also depends on the\nnature of the country involved. The Constitution of Turkey defines a parliamentary form of\ngovernment that recognizes human rights and prohibits torture or ill treatment. In 1947, Turkey\u2019s\nclose relationship with the U.S. was enhanced by the Truman doctrine to assist the country regain\nits footing economically and militarily after World War II. Between 1950 and about 1978, the\ncountry was unstable politically and saw weak coalition governments come and go. Turkey joined\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. Turkey is not a sponsor of terrorism and\nhas consistently supported counterterrorism and reconstruction efforts in the region. However, a\nterrorist group located in southern Turkey continues to terrorize certain locations in the northern part\nof the country with the objective of destabilizing the government. There is no indication the terror\ngroup uses terrorism to gain access to U.S. information. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation and explanation is sufficient to meet FI mitigating\ncondition (MC) 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which those\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it\nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) The record\nshows no connection between Applicant\u2019s brother and a foreign government, and it is unlikely that\npressure could be placed on him or through him to Applicant. Further, Turkey is a friend not foe of\nthe U.S., as demonstrated by the country\u2019s unwavering action against terrorism. Turkey is closely\naligned with the U.S. in joint political and economic objectives. While I recognize that friendly\nnations can still engage in collection of economic and intelligence information through coercive and\nnon-coercive means, Turkey is not an active collector of U.S. economic or intelligence information.\n\n6\nThough Applicant is subject to a heightened risk of foreign influence under FI DC 7.e., he\nhas dramatically reduced the risk to a reasonably safe level through the testimony of his corporate\nsecurity officer who lauded Applicant\u2019s continuing compliance with all security rules and\nregulations. Applicant\u2019s security vigilance persuades me to conclude his inheritance will not lead to\na conflict of his security responsibilities or be used effectively to manipulate or pressure him. FI MC\n8.f. (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that\nthey are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure the individual) applies to overcome FI DC 7.e. While Applicant has taken numerous trips\nto Turkey since the late 1990s, he has fully advised his corporate security officer of the trips since\nhe has been employed with his current employer, and has always undergone the appropriate briefings\nbefore and after his trips. I find for Applicant under subparagraph 1.b. Under the specific guidelines\nand the whole person model, Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under the FI guideline. \nForeign Preference (FP)\nA security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s exercise of dual citizenship. He used his Turkish\npassport instead of his U.S. passport in 2001 and 2007 after becoming a U.S. citizen and receiving\nhis U.S. passport in 2000 because it enables him to save time and circumvent bureaucracy in Turkey.\nIn his background investigation and at the hearing, he stated he used his Turkish passport because\nof the health situation of his mother and brother. Though he also stated he would renounce his\nTurkish citizenship and his passport if it were a condition of obtaining a security clearance, he\npersuaded me at the hearing that he intended to keep his passport. When an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interest of the U.S. FP DC 10.a.\n(exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen\nor through the foreign citizenship of a family member) 1. (possession of a current foreign passport)\napplies. Because Applicant voted in a Turkish election in 2002 after becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000,\nFP DC 10a.7. (voting in a foreign election) also applies. \nTo assuage the concerns raised by his dual citizenship, Applicant has repeatedly stated his\nallegiance is unequivocally with the U.S. Favorable consideration has been given to his 27-year\nresidence in the U.S., to his completion of two post-graduate degrees, to his expressed allegiance for\nthe U.S., and to his faithful compliance with security rules and regulations. However, Applicant\u2019s\npossession and use of his Turkish passport (that does not expire until January 2011) after he received\nhis U.S citizenship and passport in 2000 removes FP MC 11.a (dual citizenship is based on parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country) from consideration. Though Applicant has stated he would\ngive up his dual citizenship, the conditional terms of his relinquishment carry no probative weight\nunder FP MC 11.b. (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship) because\nhe would not be giving up his dual citizenship under his own volition. In addition, Applicant has\nsince decided he wants to retain his Turkish passport.\nFP MC 11.c. (exercise of the rights, privileges or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred\nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor) does not apply as\nApplicant used his Turkish passport in 2006 and May 2007, at least six years after he received his\nAmerican citizenship. FP MC 11.d. (use of a foreign passport is approved by the competent security\nauthority) does not apply as no entity has approved Applicant\u2019s possession and use of his foreign\npassport. FC MC 11.f. (the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the U.S. government) is also\n\n7\ninapplicable as there is no evidence Applicant\u2019s voting in 2002 was encouraged by the U.S. Though\nApplicant notes that the vote occurred before he applied for a security clearance, the action\nconstituted the exercise of a privilege of a foreign country in direct conflict with terms and\nconditions of Applicant\u2019s American citizenship. \nFP MC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) was added to the Foreign Preference guideline as a part of the\nrevised Guidelines in September 2006. The mitigating condition is a codification of the \u2018Money\nMemorandum\u2019 issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communication,\nand Intelligence in August 2000 addressing the consequences of possessing a foreign passport.\nApplicant\u2019s favorable indicators of preference for the U.S. cannot excuse the requirement imposed\nby \u2018Money Memorandum\u2019 indicating that \u201cconsistent application of the guideline requires that any\n[security] clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or\nobtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government.\u201d\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e. are found against Applicant. The FP guideline is found against\nApplicant. \nHaving addressed the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions, the circumstances of\nthis case, including the favorable evidence outlining Applicant\u2019s security vigilance and his job\nperformance, shall now be examined in the context of the whole person concept of the Directive. The\nforeign influence guideline is found for Applicant as it is apparent through Applicant\u2019s statements\nthat he is generally committed to the interests of the U.S. against other countries. Conversely, his\ncurrent possession of and intention to use his Turkish passport has not been mitigated under whole\nperson concept due to the likelihood he will continue to use a benefit of a foreign citizenship that\nAmerican citizens are not entitled to. The FP guideline is found against Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B): FOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1.a. \nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C): AGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph V. Kaplan, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 22, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 14, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Leroy F. Foreman granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\nsecurity clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 44-year-old scientist employed\nby a defense contractor.  He worked for his current employer since September 2005.  He has never\nheld a security clearance.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisor, who described him as goal-oriented, a team\nplayer, and a person who thrives on challenges.  Military officers and civilians who worked with him\nas program managers repeatedly praised him for the quality of his reports and briefings.\nApplicant was born in Iran.  He has multiple siblings.  His father was not well educated, but\nhe wanted his children to have the opportunity for a college education.  Some of Applicant\u2019s siblings\nwere educated in the U.S.  One sibling came to the U.S. in the 1960s and has been a U.S. citizen\nsince the 1980s.  Other siblings also are naturalized U.S. citizens.\nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers returned to Iran after completing his education and now is the\nco-owner of a business in Iran.  According to one of his siblings in the U.S., this brother regrets his\ndecision to return to Iran, and he has applied for immigration to the U.S., where he hopes to retire.\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s sisters declined the opportunity for education in the U.S., and they are\nnow housewives in Iran.  None of his siblings or their spouses are connected with the Iranian\ngovernment or military.  All his siblings in Iran own their homes and are financially secure.\nApplicant\u2019s family was targeted by the Iranian government because his father had supported\nthe Shah.  His parents died in the 1980s.  After their death, the family continued to suffer harassment\nby the government.  \nApplicant became interested in studying physics, teaching himself by borrowing his sister\u2019s\nbooks.  He wanted to earn a college degree in physics, but he could not leave the country legally until\nhe completed his military obligation.  He fled Iran in the 1980s because his family was being\n\n3\npersecuted and he was about to be drafted by the Iranian Army to serve in the war with Iraq.  He\nescaped by walking to another country, where he stayed for about nine months.\n  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers fled Iran at about the same time.  This brother obtained a college\ndegree in the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen.\nApplicant was given refugee status by Canada.  He chose Canada instead of the U.S. because\nit was easier to enter Canada.  He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree, a doctorate degree\nand became a Canadian citizen.  \nAt the time Applicant entered Canada, one of his sisters was a citizen and resident of the U.S.\nand another sister was a permanent resident of the U.S.  Applicant applied for residency status in the\nU.S., but his application was not granted until the late 1990s.  He moved to the U.S. and became a\nU.S. citizen in 2005.\nApplicant applied for an Iranian passport and returned to Iran in the late 1990s, looking for\na wife.  He stayed with his siblings.  He testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have much luck in Canada,\u201d was\nlonely, and wanted to be married.  Two unspecified \u201cdistant relatives\u201d had daughters who were\npotential candidates for an arranged marriage.  Applicant spent four to five weeks meeting with\nthem, and he returned in the early 2000s to be married.  He was subsequently divorced.  His ex-wife\nhas remarried and lives somewhere in the U.S.  He has not returned to Iran since 2001.\nBefore his visit to Iran, Applicant paid the Iranian government to purchase an exemption\nfrom military service.  He used one of his brothers to act as an intermediary.  When he attempted to\nleave Iran, he was detained and held in jail for about 24 hours, until his sister in Iran posted bail,\nusing her house as collateral.  His Iranian passport was not returned to him until the Iranian\nauthorities determined he was not involved in any anti-government activities.  He does not know if\nhe forfeited the bail posted by his sister.\nApplicant testified he was unaware his possession of an Iranian passport raised a security\nconcern until he received the SOR.  He subsequently mailed his Iranian passport, which had expired,\nto the Iranian Interests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan.  His passport was returned to him with\na renewal application.  He surrendered the passport again explaining that he did not desire to renew\nit.  He testified at the hearing that he intended to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  He renounced his\nIranian citizenship after the hearing.\nApplicant is now engaged to be married to a native of Iran who became a citizen and resident\nof the U.S.  His fiancee\u2019s parents are deceased, and she has no family in Iran.  She has a daughter\nwho was born in the U.S.  She has a brother who lives and works in the U.S. and a sister in Malaysia.\nThe record does not reflect the citizenship of her siblings.\nApplicant and his fiancee purchased a home in December 2006.  Applicant also owns a\npartnership share of an office building.  He has a 401(k) retirement account with his employer and\nan IRA.\n\n4\nApplicant testified he has no contact with his brother in Iran.  They last spoke three or four\nyears ago.  He and his brother had disagreements about the division of property inherited from their\nfather.  He trusted his brother to sell the property and divide the proceeds, but his brother kept\neverything.\nApplicant calls his sisters in Iran once a year, on the Iranian New Year.  He is not close to\nhis sisters in Iran, who are considerably older than he.  He has several nieces in Iran, but he has no\ncontact with them.  When asked if he would travel to Iran if any of his siblings were ill or dying, he\nemphatically responded that he would not.\nOne of Applicant\u2019s sisters, a citizen of the U.S., testified Applicant is not a social person and\nhas little contact with siblings in the U.S.  Applicant testified he sees her and his older brother once\nevery couple of months, but she testified she had not seen Applicant in five months.  He is closer to\nhis twin brother, whom he sees once every couple of weeks.  He has not seen his other sister for two\nyears.  \nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political\nauthority vested in a learned religious scholar. Current U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its\nefforts to acquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement\nin international terrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\nhuman rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and\nrestrictions on civil liberties.  Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to Shia political and\nmilitant groups in Iraq.  It also provides encouragement, training, funding, and weapons to anti-\nIsraeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process.\nThe U.S. has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.  The U.S. broke diplomatic\nrelations with Iran in April 1980, prohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and\ndiplomatic pressure to contain the threats posed by Iran. \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship.  As a result, Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens\nare considered solely Iranian citizens by the Iranian authorities, and they are subject to surveillance,\nsearch, harassment, arrest, and imprisonment while traveling or residing in Iran.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \n\n5\nTo the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings are relevant to the assigned error, they will be\ndiscussed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious and contrary to law because it does not examine relevant evidence, it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for material conclusions, and it fails to consider important aspects of the\ncase.  The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s arguments persuasive.\nThe Board has previously noted that an applicant with immediate family members living in\na country hostile to the U.S. has a heavy burden to show that those family ties do not pose a security\nrisk.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09053 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006).  In this case, the Judge\u2019s\n\nDecision at 8.\n1\nId.\n2\n6\nanalysis and conclusions are insufficient to support a favorable decision given that heavy burden of\npersuasion.\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision is predicated in part on his conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s loyalty and obligation to his two sisters in Iran is \u201cminimal.\u201d   That conclusion is not\n1\nsustainable in light of the rebuttable presumption that Applicant has ties of affection and/or\nobligation to his immediate family members and in light of all the contrary record evidence.  The\nrecord indicates that, despite Applicant\u2019s claims that he is not close to his sisters in Iran, he has more\nthan minimal contact and loyalty to them.  He visited them for approximately one month each, after\nhe had fled Iran to avoid family persecution and military service.  In order to return, he had to pay\nthe Iranian government to purchase an exemption from military service.  One sister placed her house\nas collateral to bail Applicant out of jail during one of his trips.  Contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding that\nApplicant \u201cexpressed no concern about the economic consequences of forfeiting bail when he left\nIran  . . . even though his sister had used her house as collateral,\u201d Applicant in fact testified that he\ndid not know whether the Iranian authorities had returned his sister\u2019s house to her.  Moreover,\nApplicant continues to regularly converse with his sisters by telephone once a year during the Iranian\nNew Year.\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision is also predicated in part on his conclusion that\nsome of Applicant\u2019s family members reside in the U.S. and \u201chis professional life, financial holdings,\nand his future are all in the U.S.\u201d   Facts such as those either do not readily suggest refutation,\n2\nextenuation, or mitigation of the government\u2019s security concerns in cases such as this, or they have\nlow probative value.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00109 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 13, 2006); ISCR Case\nNo. 02-22461 at 12-13 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).  At the hearing, Applicant offered testimony as to\nhis commitment to the U.S. and stated that \u201che would never do anything to hurt this country.\u201d\nHowever, an applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he might do in the future in a hypothetical\nsituation is merely a statement of intention that is entitled to limited weight, unless there is record\nevidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the past in comparable circumstances,\nor that the applicant has a previous track record of complying with security regulations and\nprocedures in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant\ncontribution to the national security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006).  Neither of those circumstances are\npresent in this case.  On the contrary, the record indicates that Applicant came to the U.S. from\nCanada in 2000, principally for personal and professional reasons, that he became a U.S. citizen in\n2005, and that he has never before held a security clearance.   \nAn applicant\u2019s testimony is evidence which the Judge must consider, and assessments of\ncredibility and demeanor are entitled to deference on appeal.  However, in his analysis of Applicant\u2019s\nfeelings toward his sisters in this case, the Judge drew certain inferences from Applicant\u2019s demeanor\n\n7\nthat went beyond what was reasonably supported by the record, with respect to the extent to which\nApplicant\u2019s personality would insulate him from pressure, coercion, or duress.  In that regard, the\nJudge gave unwarranted weight to facts such as: \u201cApplicant\u2019s demeanor when talking about his\nsiblings in Iran was detached and without emotion\u201d and \u201cHe appears to live in an intellectual,\nunemotional world.\u201d  Such inferences were largely speculative, and not a substitute for record\nevidence when concluding that Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and obligation to his sisters in Iran was\n\u201cminimal.\u201d\nFinally, the record in this case indicates that Applicant and his family members in Iran have\npreviously been targeted by the regime for coercion, exploitation and pressure, and that Applicant\nwas once detained by Iranian authorities.  The Board has noted on several occasions that such factors\nare \u201c. . .  important evidence that provides context for all the other evidence of record and must be\nbrought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-07766\nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007); ISCR Case\nNo. 05-03279 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007).  The Judge\u2019s analysis of the security significance of\nApplicant\u2019s situation contains no discussion of this important aspect of the case, a circumstance\nwhich renders his overall favorable decision unsustainable.  \nOrder\n \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

He was\ngranted refugee status by Canada, became a Canadian citizen in 1992, and became a U.S. citizen in\n2005.  He has surrendered his Iranian passport and renounced his Iranian citizenship.  He is\nestranged from his brother in Iran, has virtually no contact with two sisters in Iran, and has no\ncontact with nieces in Iran.  Four of his siblings and his fiancee are U.S. citizens.  Security concerns\nbased on foreign preference and foreign influence are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 21, 2007, admitted the factual allegations,\nand requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to an administrative judge on May 1, 2007,\nreassigned to me on July 25, 2007, and heard on August 21, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record\nopen until September 4, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence.  I\nreceived his evidence on August 31, 2007, and it has been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) G,\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old scientist employed by a defense contractor to work on\ncommunication satellites.  He worked for his current employer since September 2005 (Tr. 24).  He\nhas never held a security clearance.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisor, who described him as goal-oriented, a team\nplayer, and a person who thrives on challenges (AX E).  Navy officers and civilians who worked\nwith him as program managers repeatedly praised him for the quality of his reports and briefings\n(AX F).\nApplicant was born in Iran.  He and his twin brother were the youngest of eight children.\nHis father was not well educated, but he wanted his children to have the opportunity for a college\neducation (Tr. 95).  Applicant\u2019s two older brothers and two of his sisters were educated in the U.S.\nHis second oldest sister came to the U.S. in 1965 and has been a U.S. citizen since 1985.  His twin\nbrother, second oldest brother, and youngest sister also are naturalized U.S. citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother returned to Iran after completing his education and now is the co-\nowner of a food processing plant in Iran (Tr. 74).  According to one of his sisters in the U.S., this\nbrother regrets his decision to return to Iran, and he has applied for immigration to the U.S., where\nhe hopes to retire (Tr. 101-02).  \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s sisters declined the opportunity for education in the U.S., and they are\nnow housewives in Iran.  They are both older than he.  One is 67 years old and the other 56 years\nold.  One sister\u2019s husband worked in real estate and had a pharmacy, but he is now retired (Tr. 75).\nThe other sister\u2019s husband was a tea merchant who also worked in real estate (Tr. 76).  None of his\n\n4\nsiblings or their spouses are connected with the Iranian government or military (Tr. 75-76).  All his\nsiblings in Iran own their homes and are financially secure.\nApplicant\u2019s family was targeted by the Iranian government because his father had supported\nthe Shah.  His parents were killed in a car accident in 1982 (Tr. 108).  After their death, the family\ncontinued to suffer harassment by the government (Tr. 81-82).  \nApplicant became interested in studying physics when he was about 14 years old, teaching\nhimself by borrowing his sister\u2019s books (Tr. 99).  He wanted to earn a college degree in physics, but\nhe could not leave the country legally until he completed his military obligation (Tr. 99).  He fled\nIran in 1986 because his family was being persecuted and he was about to be drafted by the Iranian\nArmy to serve in the war with Iraq (Tr.26-27).  He escaped by walking through the mountains to\nTurkey, where he stayed for about nine months (Tr. 28).  \nApplicant\u2019s twin brother fled Iran at about the same time and went to Belgium (Tr. 80).  His\nbrother obtained a college degree in the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen in February 2004.\nApplicant was given refugee status by Canada in 1987 (Tr. 29).  He chose Canada instead\nof the U.S. because it was easier enter Canada (Tr. 28-29).  He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in\napplied physics in 1990, a master\u2019s degree in theoretical physics in 1992, and a doctorate in\ntheoretical physics in 1997 (Tr. 25-26).  He became a Canadian citizen in 1992 (Tr. 30).  \nAt the time Applicant entered Canada, one of his sisters was a citizen and resident of the U.S.\nand another sister was a permanent resident of the U.S. (Tr. 29-30).  In 1988, Applicant applied for\nresidency status in the U.S., sponsored by his sister, but his application was not granted until 1999,\nafter he had become a Canadian citizen and was in a postdoctoral fellowship program in Canada (Tr.\n32).  He moved to the U.S. in 2000 and became a U.S. citizen in 2005 (Tr. 32).\nApplicant applied for an Iranian passport in 1997 and returned to Iran in August 1999,\nlooking for a wife.  He used his Iranian passport instead of his Canadian passport.  He stayed with\nhis siblings (Tr. 70-71). He testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have much luck in Canada,\u201d was lonely, and\nwanted to be married.  Two unspecified \u201cdistant relatives\u201d had daughters who were potential\ncandidates for an arranged marriage.  Applicant spent four to five weeks meeting with them, and he\nreturned in 2001 to be married.  He was divorced in January 2003 (Tr. 33-34).  His ex-wife has\nremarried and lives somewhere in the U.S. (Tr. 34).  He has not returned to Iran since 2001 (Tr. 72).\nBefore his visit to Iran in 1999, he paid about $2,000 to the Iranian government to purchase\nan exemption from military service (Tr. 72-73).  He used one of his brothers in the U.S. to act as an\nintermediary (Tr. 73).  When he attempted to leave Iran, he was detained and held in jail for about\n24 hours, until his sister in Iran posted bail, using her house as collateral.  His Iranian passport was\nnot returned to him until the Iranian authorities determined he was not involved in any anti-\ngovernment activities while in Canada.  He does not know if he forfeited the bail posted by his\nsister.  (Tr. 64-68.)\nApplicant testified he was unaware his possession of an Iranian passport raised a security\nconcern until he received the SOR (Tr. 35). In May 2007, he mailed his Iranian passport, which had\nexpired in April 2007, to the Iranian Interests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan (AX B; Tr. 36).\nHis passport was returned to him with a renewal application (Tr. 39-40).  He surrendered the\n\n5\npassport again on August 20, 2007, with a cover letter explaining that he did not desire to renew it\n(AX B).  He testified at the hearing that he intended to renounce his Iranian citizenship (Tr. 42).  He\nrenounced his Iranian citizenship in writing on August 30, 2007, shortly after the hearing (AX G at\n3-4).\nApplicant is now engaged to be married to a native of Iran who came to the U.S. in 1984 and\nbecame a citizen and resident of the U.S.  His fiancee\u2019s parents are deceased, and she has no family\nin Iran.  She has a daughter who was born in the U.S.  She has a brother who lives and works in the\nU.S. and a sister in Malaysia (Tr. 83).  The record does not reflect the citizenship of her siblings.\nShe and her brother had an interest in family real estate in Iran, but they recently gave a power of\nattorney to someone in Iran to dispose of it (Tr. 84-85). \nApplicant and his fiancee purchased a home in December 2006 (AX C; Tr. 47-50).\nApplicant also owns a partnership share of an office building (AX D; Tr. 55).  He has a 401(k)\nretirement account with his employer and an IRA (Tr. 56).\nApplicant testified he has no contact with his brother in Iran.  They last spoke three or four\nyears ago (Tr. 51).  He and his brother had disagreements about the division of property inherited\nfrom their father.  He trusted his brother to sell the property and divide the proceeds, but his brother\nkept everything (Tr. 91).\nApplicant calls his two sisters in Iran once a year, on the Iranian New Year (Tr. 52).  He is\nnot close to his sisters in Iran, who are considerably older than he (Tr. 90).  He has several nieces\nin Iran, but he has no contact with them (Tr. 52).  When asked if he would travel to Iran if any of\nhis siblings were ill or dying, he emphatically responded that he would not (Tr. 53).\nApplicant\u2019s second oldest sister, a citizen of the U.S. since 1985 and a retired school\ncounselor,  testified Applicant is not a social person and he has little contact with siblings in the U.S.\n(Tr. 94-95, 97, 103).  Applicant testified he sees her and his older brother once every couple of\nmonths (Tr. 77), but she testified she had not seen Applicant in five months (Tr. 102).  He is closer\nto his twin brother, whom he sees once every couple of weeks (Tr. 77).  He has not seen his other\nsister for two years (Tr. 77).  \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of relevant adjudicative facts about Iran (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I; Tr. 14).  Iran\nis a theocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political authority\nvested in a learned religious scholar. Current U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its efforts to\nacquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement in\ninternational terrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\nhuman rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and\nrestrictions on civil liberties.  Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to Shia political\nand militant groups in Iraq.  It also provides encouragement, training, funding, and weapons to anti-\nIsraeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process (HX I at 1-5).\nThe U.S. has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.  The U.S. broke diplomatic\nrelations with Iran in April 1980, prohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and\ndiplomatic pressure to contain the threats posed by Iran (HX I at 3). \n\n6\nIran does not recognize dual citizenship.  As a result, Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens\nare considered solely Iranian citizens by the Iranian authorities, and they are subject to surveillance,\nsearch, harassment, arrest, and imprisonment while traveling or residing in Iran (HX I at 5).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and possesses\nan active Iranian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  The concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d  AG \u00b6 9.  A disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any\n\n7\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen\u201d including but not\nlimited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  Applicant\u2019s continued\npossession of an active Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen raises this disqualifying\ncondition.  \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(a).  They also can be\nmitigated by evidence that \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 11(b).  Finally, they can be mitigated by evidence that \u201cthe passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  All three\nmitigating conditions are established in this case.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s brother, two sisters, and a niece are citizens and residents of\nIran (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c).  It also alleges Applicant traveled to Iran in August 1999 and May\n2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.d).  \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  The totality of\nan applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be\nconsidered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n8\nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nApplicant had contact with his siblings in Iran in 1999 and 2001 when he stayed with them\nin connection with his marriage to an Iranian woman.  He has become estranged from his brother\nand had no contact with him for three years.  He has several nieces in Iran but has no contact with\nany of them.  He has minimal contact with his two sisters in Iran.  Nevertheless, given the repressive\ngovernment in Iran and its hostility to the U.S., his family ties in Iran create the \u201cheightened risk\u201d\nin AG \u00b6 7(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b), thereby raising these two\ndisqualifying conditions.\nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive\u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 WL 675725 at *12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  Although Applicant is not close to his\nsiblings in Iran, the nature of the Iranian government, its hostility to the U.S.,  and its abysmal\nhuman rights record may well place Applicant in a position of having to chose between the interests\nof his family and the interests of the U.S.  Whether he is likely to choose his family over the U.S.\nis not relevant to this mitigating condition, but it is relevant to AG \u00b6 8(b), discussed below.  I\nconclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  When Applicant fled Iran, his three older brothers and two\nof his sisters had left to study in the U.S., his two sisters who remained in Iran were significantly\nolder than he, and his parents had been dead for about four years.  He fled to escape from family\npersecution, but without any apparent concern for the two sisters he left behind.  \nApplicant has never been close to any of his siblings, including those in the U.S., except his\ntwin brother.  He is estranged from his oldest brother because of a property dispute.  He has minimal\n\n9\ncontact with his two sisters in Iran, who are older than he and not as well educated.  He expressed\nno concern about the economic consequences of forfeiting bail when he left Iran in 1999, even\nthough his sister had used her house as collateral.  When asked whether he would travel to Iran if\nhis siblings were ill or dying, he responded immediately and definitively in the negative.  \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor when talking about his siblings in Iran was detached and without\nemotion.  He demeanor did not change, even when his sister testified about him at the hearing.  \nSince adolescence, Applicant has devoted himself to his own education and scientific\npursuits.  He appears to live in an intellectual, unemotional world.  I conclude his sense of loyalty\nand obligation to his siblings in Iran is \u201cminimal\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 8(b).  On the other\nhand, his professional life, financial holdings, and his future are all in the U.S.  His twin brother, the\none sibling with whom he has a relatively close relationship, is a citizen and resident of the U.S.  I\nconclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.\nISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  Applicant has rebutted that presumption with\nrespect to his older brother and his nieces, because he has no contact with them.  He testified he calls\nhis two sisters only once a year, but he did not describe the content or extent of those conversations.\nSince the burden in on Applicant to establish a mitigating condition, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is only\npartly established, because there is insufficient evidence to show that his annual calls to his sisters\nare \u201ccasual.\u201d\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors have been discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nThe nature of the Iranian government, its relationships with the U.S. and the rest of the\nworld, and its abysmal human rights record are factors that weigh heavily against granting Applicant\na clearance, but they are not dispositive.  There is no per se rule disqualifying applicants with family\nties to Iran.  See ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 WL 675725 at *12.  The evidence, including the\ntestimony of Applicant\u2019s second oldest sister and his demeanor at the hearing, demonstrates that his\nattitude toward his siblings in Iran is detached and dispassionate.  He has been pursuing his dream\nof higher education and a scientific career for more than 20 years.  His dream and his future is in the\nU.S.  Applicant is vulnerable to having his loyalty tested by pressure, coercion, or duress against his\nIranian siblings.  However, after considering all the evidence, hearing his testimony, and observing\nhis demeanor, I conclude he would resolve any conflict between the interests of his Iranian siblings\nand the interests of the U.S. in favor of the latter.\n\n10\nApplicant\u2019s short marriage to an Iranian woman does not fit squarely into any of the\ndisqualifying or mitigating conditions.  The evidence shows that his return to Iran and selection of\nan Iranian bride was not a reflection of any preference for Iran, but merely the product of his\nloneliness and inability to find a suitable mate in Canada.  His personality, as exhibited during the\nhearing and described by his sister, suggests that his courtship skills may have been lacking.  The\nassistance of the unspecified \u201cdistant relatives\u201d offered an opportunity to find a suitable mate in a\nfamiliar cultural setting, without the necessity of the traditional Western rite of courtship.  His\nprevious marriage raises no issues of foreign influence, because his ex-wife lives in the U.S., has\nremarried, and they have no contact.  His recent engagement to a U.S. citizen strongly indicates that\nhis previous unsuccessful marriage is a closed chapter in his life.\nI have weighed the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C\nand B; considered the nature of the Iranian government, its human rights record, its involvement in\ninternational terrorism, and its efforts to foster instability in neighboring countries; considered the\ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties as well as each family tie; and evaluated all the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on\nforeign preference and foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 42 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the People\u2019s Republic\n\n2\nof China (PRC).  Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of the PRC. The evidence establishes\nthat Applicant has close and continuing relationship with his sister, which makes him potentially\nvulnerable to foreign influence. Mitigation has not been shown.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 3, 2007. Applicant requested a\nclearance decision based on a hearing record.\nOn March 28, 2007, the case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge to\nconduct a hearing and issue a written decision, but on April 19, 2007, the case was reassigned to this\nAdministrative Judge. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on April 10, 2007, and the\nhearing was held on May 10, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered two documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 and  2)\nand no witnesses were called. Applicant offered three documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - C) and\noffered his own testimony. The record was left open to allow Applicant to offer additional\ndocumentation regarding the status of the PRC. Department Counsel had until May 31, 2007, to\nrespond to the documents offered by Applicant. Applicant offered eight documents in a timely\nmanner, and Department Counsel objected to documents 3 through 8. I have entered Applicant\u2019s\ncover letter and all of the documents included, which have been identified collectively as Exhibit D.\nThe transcript (Tr) was received on May 22, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B of the Directive because Applicant has immediate family members who are not United\nStates citizens and  may be subject to duress. The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a., through 1.d.,\nunder Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a. through 1.c., and denied 1.d.. Based on\ntestimonial evidence elicited at the hearing, SOR allegation 1.d. was amended without objection.\nAllegation 1.d. now states, \u201cYou traveled to China on December 2003 and April 2007.\u201d Applicant\nadmitted this allegation as amended. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that\n\n3\nevidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 42 years old,  employed as a Systems Engineer by a defense contractor, and he\nseeks a security clearance for that position.  He received a Bachelor of Science degree in civil\nengineering from a university in the PRC in 1987, and a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Science from\na United States university in 2005. \nApplicant  was born in the PRC in 1965. He moved to the United States to get his advanced\ncollege degree in 1991, and became a naturalized United States citizen in October 2004. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is also PRC born. She married Applicant in the PRC and came with him\nto the United States in 1991.She also became a naturalized United States citizen. Applicant and his\nwife have an eight year old daughter, who is a natural born United States citizen.\nApplicant's father and mother are citizens of the PRC, but they reside with Applicant in the\nUnited States, after coming here in 2006.  They are both retired farmers. Neither his father nor\nmother ever worked for or was associated with the PRC Government.\nApplicant's sister is a citizen and resident of the PRC. She is also a farmer, and she has never\nworked for or been associated with the Government of the PRC. Applicant generally speaks to his\nsister approximately every two months, and he testified that he has a loving relationship with her.\nHe sends her between $500 and $700 a year. In April 2007, Applicant  went to the PRC to visit his\nsister because she was ill. He spent almost a week with her, and the trip cost him approximately\n$1,000. Since his sister became ill, Applicant has been calling her more frequently.\nApplicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC. They are\nnow retired, but she had worked a teacher in a business school and he worked for a manufacturer.\nNeither he nor his wife have spoken to them in many years. He last saw them during a 1997 visit he\nmade  to the PRC.\nSince Applicant moved to the United States in 1991, he has visited the PRC on three\noccasions in 1997, 2003, and in April 2007.\nApplicant testified that he has no assets in the PRC, and his net worth in the United States\nincludes his home and his vehicle\nWhen he was questioned as to what he would do if a representative of the PRC threatened\nhis sister if he did not cooperate with the government,  he testified, \u201cI\u2018d ignore them\u201d(Tr at 86).  \nCurrent Status of the PRC\nSince Applicant's sister and in-laws are citizens and residents of the PRC, it is important to\nconsider the status of the PRC at this time.\nThe PRC, the most populous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an\nimportant trading partner of the United States. It is run by the Communist Party which controls all\naspects of the PRC government. It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.\n\n4\nAlthough there has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the United States\nin the past. The PRC has an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense establishment, and space\ncapability. The PRC has launched satellites, has ballistic missiles, has nuclear arms, and nuclear\nbombs. Its diplomatic and military dispute with the Republic of China (Taiwan), foreshadows a\npossible military conflict, which the United States opposes as a resolution of the conflict. The PRC\nhas an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings; detention or incarceration\nwithout notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no right to a public,\nfair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free speech, on\nreligious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family,\nhome or correspondence. \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services. This\nis believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States. It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes\nis able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.\nPOLICIES\n           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\nan individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions\nraising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in\nEnclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or\nagainst clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration\nof those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\n\n5\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have reviewed the overall record and the totality of the evidence.  Based on the evidence\nof record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance\nbecause of Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Applicant\u2019s relatives are citizens of the PRC, which\ncould create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present\nevidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. This\nApplicant has not been able to do.\n  In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) I find that DC 7 (a) applies, contact with\nforeign family members, who are citizens and residents in a foreign country, if that contact creates\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or coercion. I do not find that Applicant\u2019s parents,\nwho now reside in the United States with Applicant, to be a security risk, nor are Applicant\u2019s in-\nlaws, with whom neither he nor his wife has any contact, a security concern. However,  Applicant\u2019s\nsister, who still lives in the PRC and with whom Applicant has a close and continuing relationship,\nremains a legitimate security concern. Applicant has shown by his description of their loving\nrelationship, and by his conduct including:  regular contact with her, sending her yearly  presents of\n$500 to $700, and his spending $1,000 to visit her when she fell ill, that he continues to have very\nstrong feelings for her. This when considered with the nature of the PRC, as described above,\nconstitutes an unacceptable  security risk.   I do not find that any Mitigating Condition applies.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B, I conclude that the  evidence\nsubstantially supporting the SOR outweighs the mitigating evidence.   Accordingly, at this time it\nis not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant  a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

On April 5, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on April 26, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2007.  On August 7, 2007, I\nconvened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant\nsubmitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence, including one exhibit Applicant submitted after\nthe hearing as she was allowed to do.  The Government had no objection and the exhibit was marked\nas Exhibit K.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 47 years old, married, and has two adult children.  She has worked for a defense\ncontractor in the health management business as a claims support adjuster for the past three years.\nShe moved to her current town of residence in 2001 from another state with her husband who wanted\nto be near his father who suffered from cancer.  In her previous state and town of residence,\nApplicant and her husband made about $75,000 annually.  They owned a house and paid their debts.\nIn April 2002, her husband lost his job, which he was able to keep even though he had moved.  He\nhad other periods of unemployment from October 2002 to January 2003, August 2003 to January\n2004, and July 2006 to December 2006.  He is currently employed as a parts department manager\nfor $30,000 annually.  Applicant earns about $25,000 annually, which is about her salary before she\nmoved. (Tr. 15, 27, 28, 41, 76-84; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant has no credit cards.  Nor does she and her husband have any savings.  They used\nhis retirement account, about $5,000, to pay for their daughter\u2019s first year of college.  The daughter\nis paying the college loans which they incurred for the other three years of her education.  Applicant\nowns a house in her current town.  They tried to sell the house in their prior town and state of\nresidence when they moved in 2001, but it never sold.  Eventually, the mortgage holder foreclosed\nin 2004.  The house sold for $6,000 less than Applicant owed, but the lender wants $23,260 as the\nbalance on the mortgage.  This debt is not listed on the SOR.  Applicant has not incurred additional\n\n3\ndebt since moving in 2001.  Her repayment plan is to repay creditors who make her settlement offers,\nwhich she can fund from her current income.  Using this plan, she repaid $5,000 in debt between\n2001 and the present time.  Another part of her repayment plan is to repay the smallest debts first.\nApplicant showed she paid three debts not listed on the SOR as part of her plan.  Applicant believes\nshe and her husband are making progress on paying her debts, in addition to having one of their used\ncars fully paid, and owing $600 on the other car. (Tr. 16, 17, 22, 26, 29-33, 41, 68, 69, 71; Exhibits\n2-5, G, H, J)\nThe SOR lists 12 delinquent debts totaling $20,713.35.  The current disposition of these\ndelinquent debts are as follows:\nSOR \u00b6, DEBT AMOUNT, CREDITOR\nTYPE\nCURRENT DISPOSITION, AMOUNT,\nEVIDENTIARY SUPPORT\n1.a $4,370 owed to bank\nCurrent balance $2,169, a line of credit used\nfor home repairs at former residence,\nApplicant currently not making payments\nbecause of lack of funds.  New debt payment\nplan in Exhibit K provides $100 monthly to\nrepay loan. Tr. 39, 42; Exhibits 2-5, K\n1.b $1,903.16 owed to hospital bill collector\nNew payment plan  shows $75 paid monthly. \nFormer plan paid nothing. Tr. 43; Exhibits 2-\n5, K\n1.c $255 owed to a medical provider for eye\ntreatment in her former town\nApplicant disputes amount and is not paying\nit at present. Tr. 44; Exhibit 2\n1.d $194.92 for a dental bill\nApplicant paid this debt on July 4, 2007. Tr.\n23, 45; Exhibit B\n1.e $584.78 to retailer for food and other\nhousehold items\nApplicant paid this debt on May 31, 2007. \nShe could not pay it before that date because\nshe had insufficient funds to do so. Tr. 24, 46;\nExhibits 2-5, B\n1.f $1,679.55 to retailer for daughter\u2019s college\ncomputer.\nApplicant could not repay on schedule\nbecause husband became unemployed in\n2002.  Applicant settled this debt for $846 on\nMay 17, 2007, by making two payments of\n$423.23. Tr. 24, 47-49; Exhibits 2-5\n1.g $2,506.17 to a retailer\nApplicant has not made payments to this\ncreditor.  Her new payment plan in Exhibit K\nshows payments of $100 monthly to be made.\nTr. 55, 56; Exhibits 2-5, K\n1.h $2,164 owed to a bank\nApplicant does not recognize this debt or\nwhat she spent that caused it.  She is not\nmaking payments now. Tr. 56, 57\n\n4\n1.i $516.70 owed to a department store for\nclothing purchased for the family\nApplicant stopped paying this debt when her\nhusband became unemployed.  She settled\nthis debt for $307 on May 4, 2007. Tr. 24, 58;\nExhibit D\n1.j $1,953.39 on a judgment for a water\nsoftener installed at their former residence \nApplicant paid $150 in 2003 on this debt.  In\nMarch 2007, she resumed payments of $100\nmonthly when her husband again got a job. \nThe debt shows on her new payment plan in\nExhibit K at $100. Tr. 37, 60-63; Exhibits 2-\n5, I, K\n1.k $186.01 for cellular phone service\nApplicant paid this debt on March 1, 2007.\nTr. 63; Exhibits 2-5, C\n1.l $4,399.67 for a judgment owed to a\nsavings and loan company for a car loan.  The\ncar is inoperative, and not repossessed.\nApplicant could not afford to pay this debt\nbefore she developed her new payment plan\nshowing this creditor will receive $100\nmonthly. Tr. 63; Exhibits 2-5, K\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\n\n5\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each\nguideline.  DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the\nDirective. (Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F:  Applicant incurred several debts listed in the SOR, including other delinquent\ndebts, after she and her family moved from one state to another in 2001 for family medical reasons.\n There are two debts she is not paying, one because she disputes her obligation for eye treatments,\nand the other she does not recognize for what the money was spent.  Lastly, she disputes an eye\ndoctor\u2019s bill and a credit card or bank bill because she contends the former did not help her\ncondition, and the latter is not known to her as a creditor.  If she could determine the legitimacy of\neach debt, she would pay them based on the totality of her efforts to repay debts to date.  All other\nSOR debts are paid or being paid monthly.\nBased on these facts, the disqualifying conditions applicable are Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and \u00b619.c. (a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations). \nThe totality of the evidence shows me there are three Mitigating Conditions (MC) that apply:\n \n(1) \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances);\n(2) \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts); and, \n(3) \u00b620.e (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue).  \nIn April 2002, her husband lost his job, and has suffered several extended periods of\nunemployment since then.  He has subsequently never been able to obtain employment at the same\nlevel of compensation, resulting in a continuous $20,000 deficit in their annual income.  The SOR\ndebts occurred before the move and loss of employment, which two factors adversely affected\nApplicant\u2019s ability to repay the debts.  She has not ignored them, paying a series of them over the\npast six years,  as shown by the exhibits she submitted.  She has a plan for repayment, and recently\namended that plan to pay every creditor something every month.  She is paying her debts, and has\nbeen executing a plan to do so with regularity and rationality.  Her efforts are made in good-faith\nfrom available financial resources.  She met her burden of proof.\nWhole Person Analysis:  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive\nduties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness\nare such that  . . .  assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.\u201d \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is \u201c eligible for a trustworthiness decision.\n\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d \u00b6 2 The Adjudicative Process, August 2006  In\n\n7\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nAdjudicative Guidelines.\nIn evaluating these factors, in addition to the DC and MC of the specific guidelines, I\nconsidered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I considered\nApplicant\u2019s age, employment status, and her husband\u2019s employment and diminution of income over\nthe past six years.  I looked at her past and present record of debt payments contained on the credit\nreports, noting her financial problems and debt repayment problems pertain to debts incurred when\nshe had greater income and her husband was employed.  No debt newer than 2001 or prior which\nis unpaid is listed in the SOR.  Before 2001, Applicant paid her debts.  I considered that only 12\ndebts were at issue, and she has paid five debts in total or in settlement amounts.  Five other debts\nshe is paying on an installment basis.  She does not have credit cards, and lives on a cash basis for\ndebt payment.  She has a plan to repay debts and it is working, limited only by her income on the\nschedule of repayment.  I do not believe she poses a trustworthiness concern or that similar conduct\nwill recur in the future.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern for Applicant.\nFinally, I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for a Public Trust position is granted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Cohen, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn April 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 19, 2007, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on March 11, 2008, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on April 15, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 29, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called eight \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nwitnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through L, which were received without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 23, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a notice on March 4, 2008, that SOR \u00b6 1.oo was \nwithdrawn. Applicant did not object to the notice and SOR \u00b6 1.oo was withdrawn. The \nnotice is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant\u2019s attorney submitted a summary of \nspecifications in the SOR. Department Counsel did not object and the summary was \naccepted as HE II.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with the exception of \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.r, 1.x, 1.gg, and 1.jj, which he denied.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never been \nmarried and has no children. Applicant is a recovering heroin addict. His father is a \nretired military officer and Applicant moved a number of times as a child. He was an \nhonor student in high school, was involved in sports and extracurricular activities, and \nwas a Boy Scout. He first started smoking marijuana in about the tenth grade. He was \ncurious and his friends were using drugs. He experimented with other drugs including \npills and hallucinogens. He worked several jobs while he was in high school and was \nable to pay for his marijuana. He started selling marijuana in his senior year in high \nschool. The person that he bought his marijuana from told Applicant that if he sold \nmarijuana that he could get his marijuana for free. His marijuana supplier later gave him \nheroin to sell, which he did. Applicant first used heroin around the end of his senior year \nor shortly thereafter. He decided to try the heroin that he was selling. He stated that the \nfirst time he used heroin, it made him sick, but he liked it. He stated \u201cit just made me feel \nreal good. The weight of the world was gone.\u201d1 \n \n \nApplicant lived at home and attended college after he graduated from high \nschool. He continued to sell marijuana and heroin and his heroin use progressed to \nwhere he was addicted and using daily. He was snorting the heroin because he had an \nabundant supply of heroin from what he was selling. Applicant\u2019s college grades were \naffected by his drug use and he left college before he graduated. He moved out of his \nparents\u2019 home shortly thereafter. Eventually his supplier no longer trusted Applicant, \nand he was forced to buy his heroin. Because the purity of the heroin he purchased was \nnot as good as what he was used to, he started injecting the heroin to maximize the \neffect.2 \n \n \nAfter Applicant was no longer selling heroin, he started committing burglaries to \nsupport his habit. He was arrested for burglary the first time in 1980, when he was 25 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 146-156, 194; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 155-157. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nyears old. In addition to his numerous burglaries, he regularly shoplifted and committed \nother crimes to support his addiction. He was arrested on more than 35 occasions \nbetween 1980 and 1994, for offenses including burglary, breaking and entering, grand \nlarceny, probation violation, receiving stolen property, assault, shoplifting, theft, armed \nrobbery, and numerous drug-related charges. He was convicted on 19 occasions for the \nvarious charges.3 He was not convicted of armed robbery. He served about 35 months \nin the state penitentiary for his various felony convictions and additional time in the \ncounty jail, work camps, and work release. Applicant estimates that when he was not \nincarcerated, from the time he was 26 until he was 42, he was clean and off heroin a \ntotal of about two years.4  \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.gg, which alleges he was arrested \nand charged with Fugitive From Justice in 1991. Applicant credibly testified that was a \nmistake. His attorney told him he did not need to be present at a hearing. The charge \nwas dismissed. He was arrested and charged with Fugitive From Justice again in 1992, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.jj. Applicant was incarcerated in another jurisdiction and was \nunable to attend a court date, resulting in a warrant for his arrest. The charge was \ndismissed.5   \n \n \nApplicant was released from prison to work release in January 1995. He went to \nwork in the construction industry for one of the witnesses who testified on his behalf. He \nwas discharged from work release to probation in April 1995. He was drug free from \nJanuary 1995 through September 1996. In September 1996, a female friend called him \nand asked him if he wanted to \u201cgo get high.\u201d He used heroin with her. He did not use it \nagain for another month. He used it again two weeks later and then he started using \nregularly until July 1997. Applicant had a warrant for his arrest for a probation violation \nfor failing the probation office drug test. He knew he was going to be arrested and his \nlife was in shambles. He called his mother and his probation officer and turned himself \nin on a significant date in his life in July 1997. He has not used illegal drugs or been \ninvolved in illegal activities since he turned himself in. He went back to jail for several \nmonths and then was released to work release, where he worked again for the same \nconstruction company.6 \n \n \nApplicant had attempted to quit heroin on numerous occasions prior to July 1997, \nand he was in various treatment programs. He still thought that he could do it on his \nown terms. In July 1997, he realized he could not and he accepted the principles of \nNarcotics Anonymous.7 \n                                                          \n3 HE II submitted by Applicant\u2019s counsel lists 18 convictions. Applicant was also convicted of Petit \nLarceny as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee. \n \n4 Tr. at 158-165; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-29. \n \n5 Tr. at 186-188. \n \n6 Tr. at 165-168. \n \n7 Tr. at 167-170. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant returned to school. He graduated Cum Laude with an Associate\u2019s \ndegree from a community college in 1998. He graduated on the Dean\u2019s List in January \n2002, with a Bachelor of Science degree from the same university he attended in the \n1970s. He was awarded a Master of Business Administration degree from another \nrespected university in 2003, and a Master of Science degree from the same university \nin 2005. He has continued to pursue education and training and he has received \ncertifications in the information technology (IT) field.8  \n \n \nApplicant continued to work for the construction company until 1999. He was \nvery highly regarded and trusted by his employer, but it was time to move on. He \nobtained a job in the IT field in 1999. He worked for this company until December 2003. \nThe former Chief Executive Officer of the company wrote a glowing letter of \nrecommendation for him. Applicant has worked for the same defense contractor since \nJanuary 2004.9  \n \n \nApplicant returned home to live with his parents after he was released from \nprison and he still lives there. His father essentially disowned his son while he was \nusing drugs and living the criminal life. He testified about the positive changes in \nApplicant\u2019s life since he stopped using drugs and he is proud of what his son has \naccomplished. Applicant loves his job, where he is very well regarded and earns a high \nsalary. He works 50 to 60 hours per week and has not missed a day of work in many \nyears. He is also co-owner of an IT company, with the knowledge of his employer. His \npartner in the IT company also works at the same defense contractor where Applicant is \nemployed. He testified that Applicant is trustworthy and completely honest. Applicant \nhas developed a close personal relationship with one of his professional colleagues. \nShe is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for 20 years. She testified about his \nhonesty, integrity, and commitment to remaining sober.  \n \n \nApplicant attended 280 meetings at NA or Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in his first \nyear of sobriety. It is not unusual for an alcoholic or an addict to attend either NA or AA \nor both, as they share the same 12-step program. He currently attends NA or AA \nmeetings about once a week. He has a support system in place with friends and family. \nHis sponsor is the founder and director of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. He \nand Applicant first met in about 1981, when they were in jail together. He is a recovering \ndrug addict who has been sober for 20 years. Applicant was very instrumental in \nassisting him in opening the center in 1998. He spent countless hours using his \nconstruction background in renovating an old building that became the center. Applicant \nhas remained very involved in the center. The sponsor was a witness on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. He testified that Applicant is his best friend and they have supported each other. \nHe described Applicant as upstanding, straightforward, trustworthy, and one of the \nfinest men he has ever met.10 \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 170-182; AE A-C, H, I. \n \n9 Tr. at 175, 182-185; GE 1; AE E. \n \n10 Tr. at 46-71; AE J. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEight witnesses, including those discussed above, testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nCharacter letters were also submitted. Applicant was universally praised by family, \nfriends, co-workers, and supervisors as honest, hard working, trustworthy, and \nnumerous other superlatives. All know about his drug and criminal background. He is \nstrongly recommended for a security clearance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested more than 35 times and convicted 19 times between \n1980 and 1994. His criminal history raises both of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing his \ncriminal acts. AG \u00b6 32(b) is not applicable. He did not totally deny any of his criminal \n\n \n7 \n \nactions except for the Fugitive From Justice charges in 1991 and 1992, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.gg and1.jj. He credibly testified that he was innocent of those crimes and the \ncharges were dismissed. AG \u00b6 32(c) is applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.gg and1.jj. \n \n \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs, been arrested, or charged since July 1997. \nSince then he returned to school and earned a Bachelor of Science degree and two \nMasters degrees. He returned home to live with his parents and regularly attends NA or \nAA meeting. He has a sponsor and a support network in place to help him maintain his \nsobriety. He has a great job that he loves and pays him a good salary. He is co-owner \nof an IT company. There is abundant evidence of successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6 32(d) \nis applicable. Because of the sheer volume of Applicant\u2019s drug and criminal history, \neven though he has been drug free for almost 11 years, I am unable to make an \naffirmative finding that his criminal past does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) is partially applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 52 years old. Since he \nwas in high school his life has been defined by when he was on drugs or living clean. \nHe started smoking marijuana in high school. He decided to start selling marijuana to \nfund his marijuana use. He sampled the heroin that he started selling and then became \naddicted. He was a drug dealer and an addict until not even his supplier could trust him \nanymore. He then became a career criminal to fund his habit, specializing in burglaries \nand shoplifting. He spent extended periods in jail and prison, and he was in various \ntreatment programs, but he always returned to heroin. He was released to a work \nrelease in January 1995, followed by probation. Applicant stayed clean until September \n1996, when he fell victim to his old habits. Applicant picked an important personal day in \n\n \n8 \n \nhis life in July 1997 to begin his sobriety. He went back to jail and has not been involved \nin drugs or criminal activity since that date, giving him almost 11 years of sobriety. \n \nSince July 1997, Applicant has been the model of rehabilitation. He finally \naccepted the 12-step program endorsed by NA and attended 280 meeting his first year \nand continues to regularly attend meetings. He moved back with his parents. His \nfather\u2019s testimony was very moving. He and his wife now have their son back. Applicant \npursued education with vigor. He thrived in his new profession. He has a support \nsystem in place to assist in his sobriety. \n \nI am convinced that the man who appeared before me on April 15, 2008 is \neverything his witnesses said he is. In contrast, prior to 1997, he was a drug addict/drug \ndealer/convicted felon who broke the law almost every day he was not incarcerated for \nmore than 20 years. His company and his business partner took a chance and trust him \nwith their financial and proprietary interests. That is commendable and so far it has paid \nhuge dividends for both. When it comes to our nation\u2019s secrets, I am not afforded the \nluxury of taking a chance on someone. Applicant\u2019s drug and criminal record is so \nextensive, that even almost 11 years later, I am unable to state that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.ff: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.gg:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.hh-1.ii:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.jj:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.kk-1.nn:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony. The Applicant is 53 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional Findings of Fact. Guideline C - Foreign Preference The Applicant has lived in the U.S. for nearly 33 years, since September of 1974 (TR at page 15 lines 5~9). He came to the U.S., as his brother \u201cwas living here already for 10 years\u201d (TR at page 15 lines 10~13). He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1985, more than 20 years ago (TR at page 15 line 20 to page 16 line 3, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1). The Applicant is married to an American, and his two children are native born Americans (TR at page 18 line 25 to page 20 3 line 23) The Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings all reside in the U.S. (TR at page 14 line 6 to page 17 line 5, and GX 1 at pages 3~4). His net worth of about $600,000~$700,000 is all in the U.S. (TR at page 21 lines 7~17). 1.a. and 1.b. The Applicant has surrendered his Iranian passport, which he never used to travel (TR at page 23 line 13 to page 25 line 8, and Applicant Exhibit (AppX) B). Guideline B - Foreign Influence 2.a.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Foreign Preference; Foreign Influence\nDIGEST: The Applicant has surrendered his Iranian passport.  He has lived in the U.S. for nearly\n33 years, and has been U.S. citizen for more than 20 years.  He is married to an American, and\nhis two children who are native born Americans.

[his foreign relative] . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d\nMitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 12, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on April 2, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued\non April 17, 2007, and the case was heard on May 8, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary\nevidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The\ntranscript (TR) was received on May 17, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence militate against the granting of a security\nclearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 53 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant has lived in the U.S. for nearly 33 years, since September of 1974 (TR at page\n15 lines 5~9).  He came to the U.S., as his brother \u201cwas living here already for 10 years\u201d (TR at page\n15 lines 10~13).  He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1985, more than 20 years ago (TR at page\n15 line 20 to page 16 line 3, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1).  The Applicant is married\nto an American, and his two children are native born Americans (TR at page 18 line 25 to page 20\n\n3\nline 23)  The Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings all reside in the U.S. (TR at page 14 line 6 to page 17\nline 5, and GX 1 at pages 3~4).  His net worth of about $600,000~$700,000 is all in the U.S. (TR\nat page 21 lines 7~17).\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant has surrendered his Iranian passport, which he never used to\ntravel (TR at page 23 line 13 to page 25 line 8, and Applicant Exhibit (AppX) B).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant has never met or spoken to his 80 year old father-in-law, who resides in\nIran (TR at page 25 line 9 to page 26 line 9).  His father-in-law is \u201chard of hearing;\u201d and as such, the\nApplicant is unable to speak \u201cto him on the phone\u201d (Id).  The Applicant is not subject to coercion\nvis-a-vis his father-in-law (TR at page 23 lines 8~12).\nAs the Applicant has an Iranian in-law, I must also consider the country of Iran.  Iran is a\nstate that sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.  It is\na theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and\nultimate political authority is vested in a learned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and worsening\nhuman rights record presents a further threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians emigrated to\nthe U.S. in 1979, after their Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind family members\nin Iran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political prisoners for harassment\npurposes.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\n\n4\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, maintained an Iranian passport.  The first disqualifying\ncondition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there was an \"exercise of any right .\n. . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .  This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered, however, by the fifth mitigating\ncondition.  \u201c[T]he passport has been . . . surrendered to the cognizant security authority . . .\u201d\nThe Applicant's father in-law is a citizen of and resides in Iran.  The first and second\ndisqualifying conditions under Foreign Influence are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates\n\u201ca potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d\nUnder the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first and second\nmitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father in-law, whom he\nhas never even met, is \u201csuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having\nto choose between the interests of . . . [his father-in-law] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the\nApplicant \u201chas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  His present supervisor, and\ntwo former supervisors, aver that he is \u201chighly responsible\u201d and/or \u201ctrustworthy\u201d (AppX A).  The\ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants\na favorable recommendation under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines\nB and C are found for the Applicant.\n\n5\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 42 years old and works for a federal contractor. From 1986 to 2005, he was\ncharged several times for incidents involving criminal conduct, some of which related to alcohol\nconsumption. He remains on probation until the end of November 2007 for the last offense. When\nhe completed his security clearance application in May 2002, he failed to disclose all of the charges\nagainst him. In a subsequent interview relating to his criminal history, he did not disclose pertinent\ninformation about one of the charges.  He failed to mitigate security concerns raised by his criminal\nconduct, alcohol consumption and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 15, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct),\nG (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines, issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 25, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing on May 15, 2007, setting the case for June 6, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 into\nevidence without objections. Applicant testified in his case and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX)\nA through G into evidence without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June\n20, 2007.\n  PROCEDURAL MATTERS\nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel indicated that the Government\ndid not intend to produce any evidence on the allegation contained in SOR \u00b6 3.a. That allegation is\nfound in Applicant\u2019s favor. (Tr. 9).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 42-years-old. He comes from a military family. His father and three brothers were\nin the Navy. (Tr. 59). He enlisted in the Navy in 1986 at the age of 21. At the time he left in 1993, he\nwas a jet engine test cell operator (E4). (GX 1). He was married to his first wife from 1986 to 1995.\nHe married his current wife in 2000. They have a young child. He was on active reserve duty from\nOctober 2001 until October 2004 as an air crewman. (GX 2; Tr. 25). After leaving the Navy, he had\nvarious job until he started his civilian current position in January 2003 with a federal contractor. He\nworks on interactive courseware for a missile satellite program. (Tr. 28). He completed a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86) in May 2002, and another one in March 2006. He has held an interim\nsecret security clearance since 2002. (Tr. 62).\n\n3\nApplicant admitted that he has a history of criminal charges and arrests, involving ten\noffenses, dating from 1986 to 2005. They are listed as follows in the SOR:\n(\u00b61.a) In June 1986, he was charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor, after he and a friend\nwere in a physical altercation at a hotel pool party. He paid a fine. He was 21 years old at the time.\n(Tr. 29; Answer).\n(\u00b61.b) In October 1989, while in the military, he was charged with Drinking in Public. He\nbelieves this involved his former wife. He did not disclose the incident on the May 2002 SF 86\nbecause he had forgotten about it. (Tr. 30; 44).\n(\u00b61.c) In August 1992, he was charged with Assault and Battery after he and his former wife\nwere involved in a physical altercation. In October 1993, the charge was dismissed and the court\nadvised them to attend marital counseling. (Answer).\n(\u00b61.d) In February 1993, he and his former wife became embroiled in another physical\naltercation. Both were charged with assault. He paid a fine and the case was dismissed. He was\nordered to attend anger management. (Tr. 32-33). \n(\u00b61.f) In 1999, he was involved in a traffic accident and charged with (1) Driving without\nInsurance, (2) Following Too Closely, and (3) Leaving the Scene of an Accident. The charges were\nreduced to Following Too Closely. He was fined and the other two charges were dismissed. (Tr. 35).\n(\u00b61.g) In November 1999, he was charged with Unlawful Use of a Drivers License, as his\ndriver\u2019s license had been suspended for failing to pay a fine. (Tr. 35). \n(\u00b61.h) In November 2001, Applicant was charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI), (2) Refusal to Take a Breathalyser, and (3) Trespassing after he ran off the road. He was\nfound guilty on the trespassing charge and fined $150. (Tr. 35-36). He did not disclose this charge\nunder question 24, relating to alcohol offenses, in the May 2002 SF 86 because the Drug and Alcohol\nProgram Administrator told him not to disclose it and because he was convicted of trespassing and\nnot an alcohol related incident. (Tr. 45-47). Prior to the arrest, he and his friends were celebrating\nhis re-enlistment into the reserves. (Tr. 35-36; GX 4 at 2).\n(\u00b61.i) On January 8, 2002, Applicant was charged with Drunk in Public after he and his\nneighbor got into an argument about her dog. (Tr. 36-37). He was found guilty, fined $15 and paid\ncourt costs. He did not disclose this charge under questions 24 and 26, relating to alcohol offenses\nor other offenses in the May 2002 SF 86, because the Drug and Alcohol Program Administrator told\nhim not to disclose it and it had not been resolved at the time he completed the SF 86. (Tr. 45; GX\n4 at 3). \n(\u00b61.j) On January 23, 2002, a Capaias was issued because Applicant violated the conditions\nof his earlier release when he was arrested in early January on the Drunk in Public charge. The\nCapias charge was later dismissed. (Tr. 38). He did not disclose this charge under question 26,\nrelating to criminal arrests, for the same reasons he did not disclose the January 8, 2002 charge.\n(Answer; Tr. 38).\n\n4\n(\u00b61.k) In May 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Refusal to Take a\nBreathalyser. In November 2005, he was found guilty of the DUI charge and sentenced to 90 days\nin jail (suspended), fined $250, and placed on probation for two years. His driver\u2019s license was\nrestricted for one year. He was ordered to go through an alcohol evaluation and education program,\nwhich he completed in February 2006. (Tr. 39-42). He is on probation until November 29, 2007. He\nand his friends were drinking and celebrating prior to his arrest. (Answer).\nIn his August 2002 statement, Applicant disclosed all charges and provided detailed\nexplanations of the circumstances surrounding the offenses. (GX 4). In that statement he admitted\nthat prior to the November 2001 arrest, he had been drinking. (Id. at 2). However, he was not as\nforthright in his subsequent August 2006 interview about it, and essentially denied that he was\ndrinking before his car went off the road. He later admitted that he misstated the facts relating to his\ndrinking that night. He did not tell the truth to the investigator because he was very embarrassed\nabout his conduct. (Tr. 50; Answer). He disclosed all pertinent charges on the March 2006 SF 86.\nApplicant admitted that he did not timely file his federal income tax returns for the years\n1997, 1998 and 1999 until after the deadline. He was under the mistaken belief that he could wait\nthree years and file all years in the fourth year. He subsequently filed the returns and paid all taxes\nin full. (Tr. 34).\nApplicant acknowledged that many of these incidents were related to alcohol consumption.\n(Tr. 53). He believes he has changed in the past couple years, especially since the birth of his young\nchild. Completing the alcohol education program and participating in some Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) meetings have helped him understand his alcohol problems. However, he no longer attends\nmeetings and claims he rarely drinks. (Tr. 54-55).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position. . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\n\n5\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of all appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and pertinent legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about criminal conduct:  \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature,\nit calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nBased on the evidence, the Government raised a security concern under three Criminal\nConduct Disqualifying Conditions: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d an\n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d and the \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), and (d). Applicant was charged with criminal misconduct on ten separate\noccasions. He was convicted in several instances and is currently on probation until the end of\nNovember 2007 for the last offense that occurred in May 2005.\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of three disqualifying conditions, the\nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence of a mitigating condition. Two Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Conditions are potentially applicable under Guideline \u00b6 32 and the facts of this particular\ncase:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\n\nSee generally, e.g. ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (Although the passage of three years\n1\nsince Applicant\u2019s last act of misconduct did not, standing aone, compel the Judge to apply CC MC 1, as a matter of lawe,\nthe Judge erred by failing to give an explanation whey he did not apply that mitigating condition.)\n6\nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when a crime is \u201crecent.\u201d  If the evidence\n1\nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an\nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged\ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s\nlast SOR-alleged criminal conduct was in May 2005, approximately two years before his hearing.\nThis misconduct is too recent to merit application of Guideline \u00b6 32(a), given his history of\ncriminal infractions that spans twenty years. Additionally, the underlying event leading to his last\narrest and conviction was related to his decision to drink excessively and then drive. It did not\ninvolve an unusual situation, contemplated under this mitigating condition. In this instance, his\ndecision to drink and drive does cast doubt on his good judgment.\nGuideline \u00b6 32(d) has limited application as there is some evidence of rehabilitation. He has\npaid the last fine imposed after the May 2005 arrest and had his driver\u2019s license restored to an\nunrestricted status. He also expressed great remorse over his behavior and appears to be establishing\na good employment record. However, as long as he remains on criminal probation he is unable to\ndemonstrate successful rehabilitation that would warrant full application of this condition.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nGuideline \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control\nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nThe Government raised a security concern under this Guideline. Applicant has been arrested\nand charged four times for incidents related to alcohol consumption, the last one occurring in 2005.\nThose charges established a disqualification under Guideline \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse, abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 23(a)-(d) are\npotentially applicable:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\n7\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment\nprogram, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress;\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established\npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings in Alcoholic Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\ntreatment program.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude none of the\nconditions apply. Guideline \u00b6 23(a) does not apply for essentially the same reasons that Guideline\n\u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Although Applicant candidly acknowledges he has a problem with alcohol,\nhe did not produce any independent evidence that he is actively and consistently participating in\na recovery program, despite a history of alcohol related offenses. Hence, Guideline \u00b6 32(b) cannot\nprovide any mitigation. The mitigating conditions contained in Guideline \u00b6 32(c) and (d) are not\napplicable because he is not participating in an employee assistance program and has not completed\na formal rehabilitation program.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about personal conduct:  \u201cConduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c that Applicant falsified his May 2002 SF 86\nby failing to disclose the 1989, 2001, 2002 and 2002 charges under questions 24 and 26, relating to\nhis police record and that the ommission established a disqualification under Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition. Under Guideline 16(a), an individual raises a concern when there is a\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determines security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Although Applicant admitted he\ndid not disclose the information, he denied that he intentionally mislead the government.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)\n\n8\n(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant completed the SF 86 in May 2004. He did not disclose four criminal charges\nbecause he forgot about an old one and was advised not to disclose the others, partially because two\nof them were still pending. Based on that explanation, along with his thorough explanation in his\nsubsequent statement and disclosure on the 2004 SF 96, I conclude, he did not intend to falsify his\nearlier SF 86. Accordingly, the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c are concluded in his favor. \nHowever, Applicant honestly admitted that he intentionally falsified his response to the\ninvestigator\u2019s questions about the November 2001 incident, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d. Based on that\nadmission, the Government established a Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition under Guideline\n\u00b6 16(a). After reviewing all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions, I considered one to be\npotentially applicable. Guideline \u00b6 17(d) provides mitigation when \u201cthe individual has acknowledged\nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstance, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d Although Applicant honestly admitted his mistake\nand attributed it to his sense of embarrassment, he has not provided evidence that he obtained\ncounseling to more fully understand his previous behavior. I find it troubling that he fully disclosed\nthe details surrounding the 2001 incident in his August 2002 statement to the investigator, but four\nyears later he attempted to shade the truth in a similar interview. That conduct leads me to believe\nthat he has not alleviated or resolved his internal conflict over his conduct. Hence, Guideline \u00b6 17(d)\ncannot apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Directive \u00b6 E2.2. In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative judge\nshould consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, his demeanor while testifying, and candid disclosure about the criminal\ncharges and personal conduct issues. I took into account his military service and commendations,\nhis commitment to family, and his current employment situation.  However, I am concerned that\nsince completing an alcohol program he has not continued to participate in a recovery program, given\nhis history of legal problems related to alcohol consumption.  Until he takes additional steps to\ndocument a substantial period of sobriety and remains outside of the criminal justice system for a\nlonger period of time, I am concerned that similar events may recur in the future. Thus, Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, alcohol considerations, and\npersonal conduct. Accordingly, Guidelines J, G and E are concluded against him.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.S1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Gary L. Rigney, Esquire \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 19, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline E for personal\nconduct (falsification of a security-clearance application). For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nMay 22, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The term nolle pros is a verb form of nolle prosequi, which \u201cdenotes either (1) the legal notice of\n3\nabandonment of suit, or (2) a docket entry showing that the plaintiff or the prosecution has relinquished the\naction.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 591 (2  ed., Oxford University Press 1995).\nnd\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on December 26, 2007, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on April 16, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 24,\n2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges nine incidents of criminal conduct. Under\nGuideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified material facts on a security-clearance\napplication because he failed to disclose three incidents of criminal conduct when\nanswering Question 23f. In his Answer, Applicant admits the Guideline J allegations\nexcept for the matter alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He denies the falsification allegation. Based\non the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a high-\nschool education graduating in 1988. He has worked in the defense industry since May\n2005. His current position is known as a quality receiving inspector. He is seeking to\nobtain an industrial  security clearance for the first time.\nApplicant married in 2005, but he and his wife are now in divorce proceedings,\nwhich involves a custody dispute for a child born in 2006. He is the father of two\nchildren with two mothers, the first child born out of wedlock in 2003. He pays child\nsupport for each and is current (Tr. 66). In addition to his full-time job, Applicant has his\nown small business doing lawn care on a part-time basis. \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, which he does not dispute (Exhibits 2\nand 3). The best evidence of his history is a RAP sheet from a city police department\n(Exhibit 2). His record of criminal conduct is described as follows:\n1.\nMay 1992\u2013arrested and charged with disturbing the peace and resisting arrest;\nguilty of disturbing the peace while the other charge was nolle prossed.  \n3\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n3\n2.\nJuly 1992\u2013arrested and charged with harassment and third-degree criminal\nmischief; guilty of harassment while the other charge was nolle prossed. \n3.\nJanuary 1995\u2013arrested and charged with harassment; found not guilty. \n4.\nJuly 1996\u2013arrested, charged, and convicted of third-degree larceny of property.\n5.\nFebruary 2001\u2013arrested, charged, and convicted of domestic violence-third\nharassment. \n6.\nSeptember 2001\u2013arrested and charged with harassment; the charge was nolle\nprossed.  \n7.\nJanuary 2004\u2013arrested and charged with violation of protection or restraining\norder; the charge was nolle prossed. \n8.\nMay 2004\u2013arrested and charged with first-degree criminal trespass; the charge\nwas nolle prossed. \n9.\nHe was identified or described by the city police department in the RAP sheet as\na domestic violence offender. \nTo sum up, Applicant has been arrested eight times and convicted four times. \nFive of the incidents involved his relationship with a woman (Tr. 63\u201365). His wife\nhas not made any allegations of domestic abuse against him (Tr. 65\u201366). He is not now\non probation, parole, or otherwise subject to a court\u2019s supervision or order. He is not\nproud of his history of criminal conduct and attributes it to not living the right type of life\nand associating with the wrong people (Tr. 29\u201330). He believes that he has matured\nand changed, and his focus is now on his children (Tr. 30). \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in September 2005 (Exhibit\n1). Concerning his police record, Question 23f asked him to answer the following\nquestion: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of\nany offense(s) not listed in response to\u201d Questions 23a\u201323e. He responded affirmatively\nand disclosed a single incident\u2014an August 2000 (date estimated) misdemeanor\nconviction for harassment. In fact, his disclosure related to the fifth incident listed above\nthat took place in February 2001. He did not disclose the sixth, seventh, or eighth\nincidents listed above, all of which concluded when the charges against him were nolle\nprossed. Applicant had no paperwork available to him when he completed the security-\nclearance application and relied on his memory (Tr. 61).     \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n4\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n6\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n17\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n18\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322. \n19\n5\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n15\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n16\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct.\nIn particular, DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant as evidenced by his multiple\n17\n18\narrests, charges, and convictions during the period 1992\u20132004. It appears Applicant has\nproblems in his relationships with women as five of the eight incidents involved women.\nBut the matter alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is not much of a security concern, because being\nidentified or described as a \u201cdomestic violence offender\u201d on a RAP sheet is not an\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, and it is not an arrest, charge, or conviction.\nA reasonable reading of the RAP sheet suggests it is a caution or warning to police\nofficers. To sum up, the facts and circumstances call into question Applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. And it raises serious doubt about whether Applicant is a\nlaw-abiding person.  \nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns, but none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.  His last arrest in 2004 was about four\n19\nyears ago, and it appears he has changed or modified his behavior. This circumstance\nis some evidence of reform and rehabilitation. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, I am optimistic, but time will tell if Applicant has truly changed his ways. In other\nwords, the evidence of reform and rehabilitation (four years without an arrest) is\noutweighed by the disqualifying evidence (eight arrests and four misdemeanor\nconvictions during a 12-year period). Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against\nApplicant. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n21\n6\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n20\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n21\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 23f in his 2005\nsecurity-clearance application. It is undisputed that Applicant was required to report the\nfour arrests and charges that occurred during 2001\u20132004. He did not, reporting only the \nharassment conviction. He contends that he answered the question in this way because\nthe other three incidents concluded when the charges were nolle prossed, which he\nbelieved meant void and did not need to be disclosed (Exhibit 2\u2013Responses to\nInterrogatories 2 and 3; Tr. 26\u201327). His explanation is credible in light of his education\nand background, coupled with his disclosure of the harassment conviction, which tends\nto undercut an intent to deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify. Although his answer to\nQuestion 23f was incorrect, the record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant\nmade an honest mistake. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept, to include the favorable testimony from four character witnesses\n(Tr. 71\u2013105), was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a\nfavorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 60 years old and has been employed as a mail clerk by a defense contractor since December 2005. Applicant was unemployed from either January 2000 to about October 2000 (as stated in her SOR response) or February 2002 to October 2002 (as listed in the Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) she submitted on March 2, 2006). She was employed as a mail clerk by an employer which was not a defense contractor from either October 2000 or October 2002 to December 2005; and by a defense contractor from July 1988 to either January 2000 or January 2002. She held a security clearance for about 10 years while employed with her first defense contractor employer. There is no report of any prior adverse action having been taken to revoke of downgrade that clearance. Applicant attended college from September 1966 to January 1968, but did not report obtaining a degree. She was married in January 1969. That marriage ended in divorce in February 1970. She has one adult child. The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, totalling $8,201, that have been submitted for collection; and an additional four delinquent debts, totalling $9,153, that have been charged off as bad debts.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from her financial\ndelinquencies and her failure to disclose the same in a security clearance application she\nsubmitted in March 2006.  \nOn April 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\nGuideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 22, 2008\n\n The interrogatories indicate they were executed in February 2006. That date precedes the date on\n2\nwhich Applicant submitted her security clearance application and is obviously in error.\n2\nreceived by DOHA on May 9, 2007, in which she admitted all allegations and requested\na clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 17,\n2008, that was mailed to Applicant the same day. Applicant was informed she had 30 days\nfrom receipt of the documents to submit her objections to any information contained in the\nFORM or to submit any additional information she wished to be considered. Applicant\nacknowledged receipt of the FORM on January 28, 2008, but did not submit a response\nto the FORM or object to anything contained in the FORM within the time allowed her. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 7, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 60 years old and has been employed as a mail clerk by a defense\ncontractor since December 2005. Applicant was unemployed from either January 2000 to\nabout October 2000 (as stated in her SOR response) or February 2002 to October 2002\n(as listed in the Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) she\nsubmitted on March 2, 2006). She was employed as a mail clerk by an employer which was\nnot a defense contractor from either October 2000 or October 2002 to December 2005;\nand by a defense contractor from July 1988 to either January 2000 or January 2002. She\nheld a security clearance for about 10 years while employed with her first defense\ncontractor employer. There is no report of any prior adverse action having been taken to\nrevoke of downgrade that clearance. \nApplicant attended college from September 1966 to January 1968, but did not report\nobtaining a degree. She was married in January 1969. That marriage ended in divorce in\nFebruary 1970. She has one adult child. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, totalling $8,201, that have been submitted\nfor collection; and an additional four delinquent debts, totalling $9,153, that have been\ncharged off as bad debts. Applicant admitted each of these debts in her response to the\nSOR. She attributes these delinquent debts to the eight or nine months of unemployment\nshe experienced in either 2000 or 2002, and a decrease in salary when she again obtained\nemployment.  \nIn her February 2007  response to interrogatories propounded to her by the DOHA,\n2\nApplicant included a letter from an attorney, dated February 6, 2007, who stated he had\nbeen retained to assist her in preparing and filing a bankruptcy petition. In her May 2007\nSOR response, Applicant claimed she was filing for bankruptcy protection. However, she\nhas failed to provide any documentation to show she has actually filed for bankruptcy\nprotection.    \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

In her February 2007 response to interrogatories, she\nexplained the reason she failed to provide truthful answers to those questions was\nbecause: \u201c I was extremely embarrassed to admit. It was a mistake which I regret.\u201d (Item\n6) She also stated in her response to interrogatories: \u201cAlthough I was not forthcoming\nconcerning my debt (due to embarrassment and shame) I am a person of integrity.\u201d (Item\n6) In her SOR response to the Guideline E allegations, Applicant wrote: \u201cI admit this\nparagraph is true. My poor judgment in answering questions was due to embarrassment\nand shame.) (Item 4)\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), and Guideline E (personal conduct) with their respective DC and MC, are\nmost relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n11\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has 13 severely delinquent debts, totalling over $17,000, that have either\nbeen submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. All of those debts have been\ndelinquent for many years. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant attributes her severely delinquent debt to the eight or nine months\nunemployment she experienced in either 2000 or 2002, and the reduced wages she\nreceived thereafter. However, she has been gainfully employed for either the past five and\none-half years or seven and one-half years, depending on which dates of unemployment\nare correct, but has failed to make any payment or payment arrangements on any of the\ndebts. She did not submit any evidence to indicate she has sought financial counselling.\nFinally, although she claimed she was seeking bankruptcy protection and submitted a\nFebruary 2007 letter from an attorney to that affect, she did not submit any evidence to\nindicate she has followed through and actually filed for bankruptcy protection. Accordingly,\nshe is not entitled to application of any Guideline F  mitigating condition.\n\n5\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant failed to disclose her numerous delinquent accounts in the e-QIP she\nsubmitted in March 2006. She admitted in her responses to interrogatories and the SOR\nthat those omissions were deliberate. DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personal security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies. I have considered all mitigating\nconditions under Guideline E and find none apply.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the\nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying conditions. I conclude Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concern caused by the financial considerations present in this case\nand her personal conduct. She has failed to overcome the case against her or satisfy her\nultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines F and E are decided against Applicant. It is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a & b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n",

As a result of this last conviction, the\nApplicant spent about 22 months in a Federal Correction Institute.  In 1976, the Applicant also\nadmits to exposing himself.  Since 1976, more than 30 years ago, the Applicant has married, fathered\nchildren, \u201cgotten religion;\u201d and in 1982 he received a Presidential Pardon vis-a-vis his Maid Fraud\nconviction.  Furthermore, his good character is evidenced by six letters of recommendation.\nHowever, under 10 U.S.S. Section 986(c)(1), the Department of Defense may not grant or continue\na security clearance to one who was sentenced to more than one year in jail, and actually served more\nthan one year in confinement.  Clearance is denied solely as a result of 10 U.S.S. Section 986(c)(1).\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 30, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on May 16, 2007.  A notice of hearing was initially\nissued on May 22, 2007, setting the hearing for June 14, 2007.  However, pursuant to a request from\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel, the case was continued to and heard on June 25, 2007.  The Government\nsubmitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted\ndocumentary evidence on his own behalf.  The transcript (TR) was received on July 6, 2007.  The\nissue raised here is whether the Applicant's admitted past Criminal Conduct militates against the\ngranting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the\nallegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 60 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor,\nwhich seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n1.a.  The Applicant was arrested in December of 1967, and subsequently pled guilty to two\n\n3\ncounts of Indecent Exposure (TR at page 14 line 16 to page 15 line 1, and Government Exhibits\n(GXs) 6~11).  As a result of this conviction, the Applicant was treated in a mental hospital from\nabout February of 1968 to about August of 1969 (TR at page 21 line 23 to page 23 line 17, and GXs\n16~18).  In 1976, the Applicant had a relapse and admits to exposing himself once again (TR at page\n35 line 8 to page 36 line 4, and at page 45 lines 4~12).  He was 29~30 years old at the time of this\nlast incident, and has not participated in any other Criminal Conduct for more than 30 years (TR at\npage 35 line 8 to page 36 line 4, at page 45 lines 4~12, at page 47 lines 6~9, GX 1 at page 2, and GX\n5).\n1.b. and 1.c.  The Applicant was again arrested in August of 1972, and subsequently charged\nwith Mail Fraud and Use of False Name to Conduct Mail Fraud (GX 2).  He was convicted, and\nsentenced to four years imprisonment, of which he spent about 22 months in a Federal Correction\nInstitute (Id).  As a result of this confinement, the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Section 986(c)(1) apply.\nIn 1972, the Applicant \u201cgot involved with a group of \u2018hippies.\u2019  And . . . part of their support\nwas to [fraudulently] fill out credit card applications . . . for credit cards and then we would obtain\nthe merchandise and sell it at swap meets\u201d (TR at page 39 line 23 to page 40 line 8).  In 1982, the\nApplicant received a \u201cFull and Unconditional Pardon,\u201d from the President, for his 1972 conviction\n(TR at page 16 lines 9~16, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) H).\nSince 1976, the Applicant was married in 1979, has fathered three children, has several\ngrandchildren, and has \u201cgotten religion\u201d (TR at page 13 line 22 to page 14 line 10, at page 45 line\n13 to page 46 line 2, at page 46 lines 6~9, and GX 1 at page 13).  A Senior Deputy County Sheriff\nbest describes the Applicant, in part, in the following terms:\nIt is my distinctive honor to recommend such a fine individual as . . . [the\nApplicant] for your consideration.  I have known . . . [the Applicant] and his\nwonderful family for almost 18 years.  I have worked with . . . [the Applicant]\nprofessionally, spiritually and socially as a very dear friend.\n*   *   *\nAgain, I highly recommend . . . [the Applicant] for a position requiring\nintegrity, honor, commitment, and dependability.  Men like . . . [the Applicant] don\u2019t\ncome [along] often, but when they do, it\u2019s tremendous (AppX C).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\n\n4\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline J (criminal conduct), which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance\nholder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has\ndemonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there exists the possibility that an applicant may\ndemonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant\u2019s admitted past Criminal Conduct is evidenced by two convictions in 1967\nand in 1972, and by an admitted, but uncharged, indecent exposure in 1976.  The first disqualifying\ncondition under Criminal Conduct is therefore applicable, as there is \u201ca single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses\u201d present.  However, this is countered by the first mitigating condition as \u201cso\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior . . . [more than 30 years] that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, those who know the\nApplicant speak most highly of his character, credibility and trustworthiness (AppXs A~F, and I~P).\nThe totality of the Appellant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, normally\nwould warrant a favorable Decision under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\n\n5\nHowever, this case also falls under the last disqualifying condition; i.e., \u201cconviction in a\nFederal . . . court . . ., sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated\nas a result of that sentence for not less than one year.\u201d  This implements 10 U.S.C. Section\n986(c)(1), which prohibits the Department of Defense from granting a security clearance to any\napplicant who was so convicted.\nThe statute also provides that an exception to this prohibition may be authorized in a\nmeritorious case if there are mitigating factors.  The last mitigating condition states that the last\ndisqualifying condition \u201cmay not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, . . .\n[the Director of the] Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) or his designee, has granted\na waiver.\u201d\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the \u201cwhole person,\u201d I conclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his Criminal Conduct.  However, based solely on 10 U.S.C. Section 986(c)(1), Applicant\u2019s\nclearance must be denied.  In accordance with DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64, dated September\n12, 2006, a copy of this decision will be forwarded to the Director, DOHA, for a determination\nwhether to exercise his discretion to grant a waiver in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Section 986(d).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nc. Against the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nClearance is denied based solely on 10 U.S.C. Section 986(c)(1).\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",
