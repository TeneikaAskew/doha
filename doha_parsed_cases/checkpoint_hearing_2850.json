I adopt his admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He attended college, but did not graduate. He married in \n2007 and has a grown stepdaughter. He served in the military reserves and National \nGuard at various times from 1986 to 2003, and was on active duty from 1997 to 2003. He \nparticipated in combat operations in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. He has worked as a \nfederal contractor overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan in combat zones. He has been \nemployed with his present employer since December 2017. (Tr. 15-17, 57-59; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period of unemployment and \nunderemployment. In 2013, he was laid off from his well-paying job ($166,000 annual \nsalary). (GE 2) He was unemployed from October 2013 through 2014. He used his \nsavings to pay his expenses. He decided to go back to school in February 2014 to October \n2014 to obtain certifications that would help him get a good job. He used the military \neducation benefits he had earned that paid his tuition and a stipend. He also worked part-\ntime. In an attempt to pay his bills, in 2014, he started a business, but it failed. Applicant \nfiled Chapter 13 bankruptcy in October 2014, but it was dismissed in 2015 because he \nwas unable to make the required payments. He was able to get another overseas \ncontractor job in mid-2015. (Tr. 17-24, 55-57, 59-64; GE 1, 2; AE I) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his security clearance application, interrogatories, and \ncredit reports from September 2019, September 2020, and September 2021 corroborate \nthe allegations in the SOR. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \nAfter Applicant got a defense contractor job overseas, the salary was insufficient \nto pay his past bills. He attempted to negotiate with his creditors to pay his bills, but it was \nlogistically difficult due to living overseas, time differences, and being unable to make \ncontact. In 2018, he attempted to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy again, but was told he earned \ntoo much. He was saving money while overseas. He then contracted with a debt relief \ncompany (the DRC) in March 2018 to help him resolve his delinquent debts. He paid them \na lump-sum payment of $6,000 to begin addressing both his unsecured and secured \ndebts. The DRC would take a percentage of the amount the debt was settled for and a \nmonthly fee. Although the DRC was helping him settle his debts, he stated that he \nreached a level of frustration with them because he felt like they were procrastinating in \nsettling his debts so they could continue to receive fees. (Tr. 63-73, 77; AE B) \nApplicant testified that the DRC did not inform him until 2022 that it would not \nnegotiate settlements on secured debts. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,777) is a secured \ndebt. He explained that the DRC had the debt for more than three years and did nothing. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe contacted the creditor and arranged a payment plan to make three monthly payments \nof $1,233 beginning in May 2022.

(Tr. 25-31; AE B, D, J) \nApplicant provided proof that he has paid the following debts directly, they were \nsettled through the DRC, or he is making payments through a payment plan. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g - same creditor ($616 and $1,065 respectively), paid. \n(Tr. 31-33; AE K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,928) settling for $3,396, monthly payments of $283.

Before he was laid off in 2013, he did not have \nfinancial problems. Applicant does not have any new delinquent debt. He pays his \nexpenses on time. He files his income tax returns on time. He testified that he participated \nin financial counseling in 2019. He credibly testified that he intends to complete the \npayment plans he has arranged. (Tr. 52, 73, 76-77; AE E) \nApplicant provided a copy of his resume and excellent performance reviews. \nLetters of recommendation describe him as knowledgeable, selfless, trustworthy, and a \nteam player.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2015 that he \nwas unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts after he was laid off from his well-paying \njob in 2013. He attempted to use his savings to pay his debts, but was unable. He \nattempted to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but could not afford the payments. He attempted \nto contact his creditors to resolve his debts while he was living overseas, but it was \nlogistically prohibitive. He eventually contracted with DRC to help him settle his debts, \nwhich they did. He later learned they would not negotiate settlements on secured debts. \nApplicant felt they were procrastinating in settling his debts and took action to contact the \ncreditors and negotiate payments on his own behalf. Applicant has paid or is paying all of \nthe delinquent debts alleged. I find Applicant did not ignore his financial responsibilities \nand acted responsibly under the circumstances. Future financial issues are unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant received financial counseling and made good-faith efforts to pay or \nresolve his debts. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR identifies five allegations under Guideline B (foreign influence) applying to Applicant\u2019s foreign family members and friends, who are citizens and residents of Iraq. He admitted all allegations. References to the government exhibits shall be to the typed page numbers located in the upper right corner of the page. Applicant, 34 years old, was born in Iraq in 1987. He received his Iraqi high school diploma in July 2008. He entered the United States in May 2012, and tried to renounce his Iraqi citizenship when he became a U.S. citizen in June 2017. He was informed that that the policy had changed allowing him to retain his Iraqi passport but not to use it. He has not used his Iraqi passport since becoming a U.S. citizen in June 2017. (GE 2 at 5) He earned some college credits in 2014 at a U.S. community college, but received no degree.

Eligibility for security clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 1, 2018, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On August 21, 2018, he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Department of \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) could not make the \npreliminary affirmative findings required to grant a security clearance. The DCSA \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 28, 2021, detailing \nsecurity concerns under the guideline for foreign influence (Guideline B). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n1 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD \non June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided an undated answer to the SOR. He provided his signature \nto the hearing request form and dated it May 7, 2021. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 30, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \nof hearing on December 1, 2021, for a hearing on December 22, 2021. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s two exhibits (GE) 1-2 and Applicant\u2019s \nthirteen exhibits (AE) A-M were entered into evidence without objection. The record in \nthis case closed on January 10, 2022 when DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing. \nAdministrative Notice \nThe Government requested that I take administrative notice of certain relevant \nfacts related to Iraq. The facts are limited to matters of general knowledge and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. The Government\u2019s administrative notice memorandum \nand source documents are identified as HE (1). The additional source documents are \nidentified as HE (2). Applicant had no administrative facts that he wanted me to take \nadministrative notice of regarding the Republic of Iraq. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR identifies five allegations under Guideline B (foreign influence) \napplying to Applicant\u2019s foreign family members and friends, who are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. He admitted all allegations. References to the government exhibits \nshall be to the typed page numbers located in the upper right corner of the page. \nApplicant, 34 years old, was born in Iraq in 1987. He received his Iraqi high \nschool diploma in July 2008. He entered the United States in May 2012, and tried to \nrenounce his Iraqi citizenship when he became a U.S. citizen in June 2017. He was \ninformed that that the policy had changed allowing him to retain his Iraqi passport but \nnot to use it. He has not used his Iraqi passport since becoming a U.S. citizen in June \n2017. (GE 2 at 5) He earned some college credits in 2014 at a U.S. community college, \nbut received no degree. Before he began attending a university in the fall of 2020, \nwhere he intends to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022, he attended a \ncommunity college. To pay for his education, he receives financial aid, a scholarship, \nand a monthly check from a friend. Applicant has never been married. He seeks his \ninitial security clearance. (GE 1 at 9-10, 16, 28, 73, 76-80, 89-90) \nIn May 2018, Applicant was working in the United States as a mechanic. In \nApril 2018, he was hired as a linguist, and anticipates deployment once his security \nclearance application is granted. His security clearance application shows a gap in \nemployment activity from January 2018 to April 2018. He was unemployed between \nOctober 2014 and December 2017. During the period, he traveled to six foreign \ncountries. Four of those trips were to Iraq, and each lasted more than 30 days.

He was unemployed in the previous five months. For a two month-\nperiod in 2012, he worked for a cleaning company. From December 2008 to October \n2011, Applicant was employed by a defense contractor as a linguist in Iraq. His \nsupervisor during the period wrote a statement about Applicant\u2019s good performance as \na linguist between 2009 and 2010. (GE 1 at 24; AE B). Before working as a linguist, he \nwas unemployed from January 2007 to November 2008. (GE 1 at 16-25) \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Applicant\u2019s mother is 52 years old. She is a resident citizen of Iraq. \nShe is a housewife and cares for the family children. She used to work on the family \nfarm until it was destroyed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in 2014. \nApplicant has weekly contact with her by telephone and social media. He sent her \nmoney from 2014 through 2020, but has sent no money in 2021. The mother has never \nhad contact with any government or military. Living with his mother are two of \nApplicant\u2019s sisters and one brother. Applicant\u2019s mother does not have an inheritance. \nInstead, she obtains assistance from non-government organizations (NGOs) and the \nresources provided by the United Nations. Applicant\u2019s father passed away in 2014 in \nthe ISIS attack. GE 1 at 29-34; Tr. 26-30, 45-46) \nSOR 1.b \u2013 Applicant has a 15-year-old brother who is a citizen and resident of \nIraq. He attends an Iraqi high school. As noted in the preceding paragraph he lives with \nApplicant\u2019s mother. In Applicant\u2019s weekly phone calls with his mother, he speaks with \nhis younger brother. The brother is unemployed and has no affiliation with a foreign \ngovernment or military. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 31, 46) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 Four of Applicant\u2019s sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. The \n32-year-old sister is a married housewife.

(GE 1 at 53-55; Tr. 61-\n62) \nApplicant provided financial support to some of his relatives and friends from \nhis Iraqi hometown. Except where noted, most these individuals are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. The reason for the support was that these individuals lost everything \nfollowing an attack by ISIS in 2014. (Tr. 43-44) It is surprising that Applicant never \nmentioned this attack in his August 2018 PSI. Instead, he only explained the family \nmembers that lived in tents and the gifting was based on a family custom motivating \nfamily members to work together and share financial burdens. See GE 2 at 7. \nApplicant has given about $18,000 to his cousin D for transfer to Applicant\u2019s \nmother and sisters; he provides about $10,000 annually in financial support for his \nmother (SOR 1.a). (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 62-63, 66) \nApplicant sent cousin (L), a citizen of Iraq living in a European country, \napproximately $2,500. He indicated he sent the money because, like some of the other \nrecipients, this cousin he had lost everything in the 2014 ISIS attack. Applicant sent \nfriend E $5,000 and another cousin I $300 for the same reason. He sent his uncle J \nabout $4,000 to help pay his child\u2019s medical expenses that the uncle could not afford. \nHe sent friend E $1,500 to help get back on his feet after the 2014 attack. (Tr. 63-64) \nApplicant sent uncle J, referenced earlier, another $2,000. Applicant described \nthe frequency of his support to this recipient as \u201ctwist.\u201d See GE 1 at 57, 58. (No \nadditional information was provided.) He sent friend I $200 to give to his aunt (K). He \nsent friend E about $200. Applicant sent cousin I $700 to transfer to Applicant\u2019s \nmother. Applicant provided $2,500 to uncle J a couple of times. (Tr. 64-65) According \nto Applicant\u2019s August 2018 PSI, he provided at least $34,200 to relatives and friends. \n(GE 2 at 7) Part of the money Applicant gifted to his relatives and friends in Iraq came \nfrom his savings and from his friends in the United States. (Tr. 62-65, 80-83) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent trip to Iraq was in December 2020. He arrived in the \ncountry on December 10, 2020 and returned to the United States on January 7, 2021. \nHe went to the country on several occasions in 2016 to determine whether any of the \nvictims in the 2014 hometown attack were members of his family. He indicated he lost \nfour family members in the 2014 attack. However, as noted earlier, he did not mention \nthis horrific event in his August 2018 PSI. Because of the unstable security situation in \nhis hometown, Applicant applied in 2018 to the International Organization for Migration \n(IOM) for his family members to immigrate to the United States. (Tr. 67-70) \nApplicant has no foreign property or financial interests. (GE 1 at 56) Though \nhe owned a home in the United States in August 2017 (GE 1 at 12), he testified that he \nowns no home or property in this country at the present time.

When asked \nwhether he was involved in his community, he testified \u201cwhat is that,\u201d then he indicated \nthat he was not involved in a religious or community organization. (Tr. 78-80) \nIf a terrorist group tried to exert pressure on and through one or more of \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members to get Applicant to divulge or disclose classified \ninformation, he would not yield to that pressure. (Tr. 75) \nCharacter Evidence  \nApplicant\u2019s witness (W) testified that he met Applicant while stationed in Iraq in \nFebruary or March 2009. W was part of an advisory and assistance team that traveled \naround to train local Iraqi border enforcement agents (border agents) in logistics and \nsecurity. Applicant was introduced as the team\u2019s interpreter for the next 12 months. He \nsupported the team on patrols through villages and forts. If the team had information to \nexchange with local border agents, Applicant would translate that information. He \nfrequently proposed ideas to enhance communication and interaction between the \ncoalition forces and the Iraqi locals. He taught the team different dialects of the Arabic \nlanguage. (Tr. 12-15, 20) \nW explained that during his Iraqi deployment, about 70% of the time was spent \non missions away from the military base, and 30% of the time they were inside the \nbase to rest and replenish. W was armed during these missions, with body armor and \nprotective equipment. He recalled no combat incidents. Though W could not recall \nmeeting any of Applicant\u2019s family members, he remembered that Applicant\u2019s family \nprepared a meal and Applicant brought the meal to the team. (Tr. 16-20) \nOn March 3, 2009, the team chief (TC) from December 2008 to March 2009, \nindicated that Applicant was a level one interpreter with a commendable performance \nrecord in executing interpreter duties with the border patrol officers and coalition forces. \nApplicant displayed a promising future as an interpreter. In January 2009, he received \na certificate of appreciation for his service. (AE A) \nOn December 31 2009, a major (MA) wrote a recommendation for Applicant\u2019s \nadmission into the Special Immigrant Visa program (SIV) based on his stellar linguist \nservice between December 2008 and the end of December 2009. He excelled at \ntranslating discussions, manuals, and other documents. He provided effective \nassistance in the maintenance of equipment and before and after mission \nresponsibilities. During the period of conflict, because Applicant and his family faced \nthreats from insurgents hostile to the Iraqi government, Applicant constantly wore \nprotective gear and concealed his identity to minimize the risk he and his family could \nbe kidnapped or executed. Applicant received a certificate of appreciation from MA for \nhis service to the coalition forces.

The remainder of this endorsement mirrors \nM\u2019s endorsement. (AE C) \nOn August 3, 2010, the commandant (CO) of the continuing education center, \nwrote that Applicant risked his life on numerous occasions in patrols and forays with \ncoalition forces. Applicant also trained Iraqi security forces so they could achieve more \neffective security objectives. CO has no reason to believe that Applicant represents a \nthreat to the national security of the United States. On August 3, 2010, CO provided \nApplicant a certificate or his support at the education center. (AE D) \nOn October 10, 2011, a captain (CP) wrote a recommendation based on \nApplicant\u2019s service in A\u2019s unit for three months in 2011, and his service by MA since \nDecember 2008. He carried out linguistic and cultural liaison responsibilities in a \nproductive manner. He demonstrated loyalty and honesty. (AE E) On October 10, \n2011, Applicant was commended for his honorable linguist service, but informed his \nassistance would no longer be needed. (AE F) \nIn an undated and unsigned recommendation, a squad leader (SL) wrote that \nhe was deployed to Iraq and Applicant was an interpreter who participated in about 400 \ncombat missions and deserves significant credit for training the Iraqi police and army. \nIn an undated unsigned recommendation, a retired police detective (PD) \nindicated that he held positions in the U.S. government at some time. He supervised \nApplicant for a two-year period between 2009 and 2011. As his most trusted \ninterpreter, PD helped Applicant apply for a visa through the SIV program. PD \nrecommends Applicant for a security clearance. (AE H) \nIn an undated, unsigned letter of recommendation, the assistant director (AD) \nof the international studies program commented on his affiliation with Applicant. AD \nassisted Applicant in the selection of a university to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree. AD \nwas involved in courses Applicant selected. He also taught two of Applicant\u2019s courses. \nApplicant has shown a strong commitment to developing a career in the international \ncommunity. (AE I) \nIn an unsigned and undated recommendation, a sergeant (SE) explained that \nhe served with Applicant in Iraq from 2009 to 2010, when SE returned to the United \nStates. After Applicant returned to United States in 2012, they resumed their contact. \nSE believes Applicant is continuing his education so he can be a productive and \ndedicated member of the United States.

For \nthe entire period, Applicant provided effective participation in the success of the \ncoalition mission. (AE L) \nIn an undated recommendation, a former civilian police advisor (PA) contractor \nwas detailed to train local police forces, and relied heavily on the linguist assigned to \nthe PA\u2019s team. PA and Applicant worked together for months. Applicant listened \nclosely to the local Iraqis in meetings. During these meetings, he occasionally alerted \nPA\u2019s team when he believed other unfamiliar linguists were experiencing difficulty \ntranslating a dialect. He also took extra time to ensure that the audiences at these \nvillage meetings understood the issues for discussion as completely as possible. \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Republic of Iraq \nIraq is a parliamentary republic that continues to evolve into a stable country. \nThe outcome of the 2014 parliamentary elections met international standards of fair \nelections and led to the peaceful transition of leadership from former Prime Minister \nNouri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. \nIn December 2019 because of the constant demand for changes in the Iraq \npolitical system, Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi resigned. A new prime minister was \nconfirmed by the Iraq cabinet in May 2020. He promised to improve security and fight \ncorruption. Several assassinations later in 2020 of protest leaders and a well-known \nresearcher caused serious doubt in whether the new prime minister would be able to \naccomplish his objective. \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at a high risk \nfor kidnapping and terrorist violence. The U.S. Government considers the potential \nthreats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to \nlive and work under strict security guidelines. \nA 2019 human rights report indicated that serious human rights problems are \nstill widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility and corruption at all levels of government \nhave diluted the Iraqi government\u2019s human rights protections. Other human rights-\nrelated problems include: dangerous conditions in prisons and detention facilities; \narbitrary arrest and pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression and assembly; \nand discrimination based on gender, race, and religion. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, \nwhich are flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which \nthe foreign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology. \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. However, if an \napplicant has close ties to only one foreign family member, this factor may be sufficient \nto create the potential for foreign influence. \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign influence cited in AG \u00b6 7(a) is elevated by \nseveral factors: the nature and strength of the family ties; the type of foreign \ngovernment under consideration; its relations with the United States, and the country\u2019s \nhuman rights record. The risk of foreign influence is greater if the foreign government is \nauthoritarian in nature, or if the family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe foreign government, or if the country directs intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or if there is terrorist activity within the country. The risk of foreign \ninfluence and coercion are pertinent factors to determine the likelihood of vulnerability \nto government coercion or a hostile element within the country. The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nof the foreign exploitation may establish a potential conflict of interest between an \napplicant\u2019s duty to safeguard classified information and the desire to help a foreign \nentity as set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \nThe circumstances of this case show that Applicant has weekly contact by \nphone or social media with his mother and two married sisters. He contacts his \nbrothers-in-law on a monthly basis. He contacts his cousin, the police officer, weekly. \nApplicant contacts his childhood friend, currently employed by the Iraqi ministry of \ndefense, on a weekly or monthly basis. Applicant contacts another cousin, a state \nmonitoring officer, on a monthly basis. He contacts another uncle and aunt four times a \nyear. Applicant\u2019s regular contacts with his foreign family members and friends, his \ngifting of at least $34,200 to foreign family members and friends, sometimes on a \nrepeated basis, from 2014 to 2021, and his extended trips to Iraq since 2016, establish \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b). \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his mother, two married sisters, his brothers-in law, \nhis cousin the police officer, his cousin the military service person, the state monitoring \nofficer, and the gifting of at least $34,200 to foreign family members and friends, have \nnot been casual and infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has close ties and contacts to his family members as exemplified by \nhis gifting of at least $34,200 to several of these persons from 2014 to 2021. \nThe risk of improper influence by a hostile element being exerted on Applicant through \none of his foreign family members cannot be ignored. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply \nbecause of the continuing terrorist activity in Iraq, and the unsatisfactory human rights \ntroubles that persist in the country. \nThe documented and testimonial evidence of Applicant\u2019s commendable \nperformance as a linguist in Iraq in 2009 to 2011, weighs in his favor. However, based \non his contacts and ties and gifting history to several foreign family members in Iraq, it \nis difficult to characterize these contacts as \u201cso minimal,\u201d under the first prong of AG \u00b6 \n8(b). \nI find that insufficient evidence has been presented to meet the second prong \nof AG \u00b6 8(b) \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States\u201d \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in May 2012, and was naturalized as a U.S. \ncitizen in June 2017. He owns no American property and has $20,000 in his checking \naccount. He has no retirement account or other financial interest in the United States. \nExcept for his educational history that began in 2014, and continued from the fall of \n2018 to the present, including his endorsement from AD (AE I), Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships in the United States pale in comparison to his ties and gifting of at least \n$34,200 to his family members and friends in Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(b) has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence and foreign \npreference guidelines in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person \nconcept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n11 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have carefully weighed Applicant\u2019s linguist career for three years that ended \nin October 2011 and his brief assignment in 2013. The testimonial evidence of W \nregarding Applicant\u2019s performance is duly noted. He participated in over 400 combat \nmissions applying his craft in an outstanding manner. His admirable service led to his \nimmigration to the United States through the SIV program. Applicant\u2019s contacts and \nrecord of financial support for his foreign family members and friends in Iraq \ndemonstrates his ongoing concern and affinity for them. However, these relationships \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign influence. There is insufficient evidence in the \nrecord to conclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. interests outweigh his strong ties and bonds to \nhis foreign family members and friends in Iraq. The country confronts continuing \nthreats from terrorist groups and human rights abuses are still prevalent. Considering \nthe evidence from an overall commonsense point of view, Applicant has not met his \nheavy burden of mitigating the security concerns based on the foreign influence \nguideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. \nPaul J.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec.

A hearing was scheduled for April 28, \n2022, and heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted \nof two exhibits. (GEs 1-2) Applicant relied on five exhibits and three witnesses (including \nhimself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 8, 2022. \nBesides its three exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of \ndetailed facts taken from 22 U.S. Government official publications. Administrative or official \nnotice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR \nCase No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing \nfacts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. \n25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  \nFor good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the \nabove-named background reports containing the identified facts in Department Counsel\u2019s \nRequest for Administration Notice regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) \n(inclusive of Hong Kong, a part of China). Administrative Notice was extended to the \ndocuments themselves, consistent with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This \nnotice did not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the \ninformation contained in the reports addressing Hong Kong\u2019s current state. Department \nCounsel\u2019s Administrative Notice Request was received as HE 1. \nIn addition to the source documents covered by Department Counsel\u2019s \nAdministrative Notice Request, I took official notice of Background Note: Hong Kong \nSpecial Administrative Region (SAR), U.S. Department of State (December 2007) and \nTrade in Goods with Hong Kong, U.S. Dept. of Commerce (March 2019). These \ndocuments were received and marked as HE 2.  \nI also took administrative notice of five source documents provided by the \nGovernment: China 2017 Human Rights Report (includes Tibet, Hong Kong and Macao, \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of State (March 2017); 2016 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic \n& Security Review Commission at 289 (China Ec.

App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019) \nfrom those in the present case. In Applicant\u2019s case, security concerns are centered \naround his ties to his father-in-law and stepmother-in-law who are both citizens and \nresidents of Hong Kong. With these in-laws, Applicant claimed little personal contacts \nwith these in-laws, neither of whom are aware of what Applicant does for a living. See \nApplicant\u2019s closing submission, supra, at 2. Applicant, in turn, distinguished the key \nrelationships discussed in ISCR Case No. 17-04208. The facts in this case involved an \napplicant and her spouse who were dual citizens of Hong Kong with and parents and in-\nlaws, respectively, who were citizens residing in Hong Kong. With her mother in this \nearlier case, the applicant engaged in regular telephone communications. See Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing Submission, supra at 2-3. \nApplicant also stressed his deep and longstanding ties, loyalties, and relationships \nto the United States, as well as Applicant\u2019s understanding of the breadth and depth of \n\u201cthe geopolitical threats posed\u201d to the United States by the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC, hereinafter referred to as China). See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, supra \nat 2. In making his case, Applicant acknowledged the very heavy burden of persuasion \nhe bears in mitigating the potential security risks posed by his father-in-law and \nstepmother-in-law in Hong Kong. \nAdditionally, Applicant noted the military contributions of his father and grandfather \nto U.S. military and security interests, as well as his own unique language and research \nskills and demonstrated high character. See id. Applicant closed with his demonstrated \ncommitment to following all relevant DoD policies and guidelines should he be granted a \nsecurity clearance. \nThe Government\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission accepted the \nfacts of the case set forth in Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR and amplified in Applicant\u2019s \nhearing testimony and exhibits. See Response to Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \nsupra, at 2 (HE 5). Accepting the facts pled by Applicant, the Government urged a \nstandard to be applied that placed a very heavy burden on applicants seeking security \nclearances who have family members (both immediate and extended) who are citizens \nand residents of Hong Kong (a part of China). See id, at 2-6. \nIn addition to covering Appeal Board precedents addressing the security interests \nassociated with applicants who have immediate and extended family members in Hong \nKong, the Government stressed the very heavy burden of persuasion that Applicant faces \nin this case to rebut the presumption of affection and common interests that implicitly \nexists between an applicant and his family members who reside in Hong Kong (citing \nAppeal Board case precedents) to satisfy Applicant\u2019s very heavy evidentiary burden. \nAfter summarizing Appeal Board precedents, the Government urged that the \nrecord evidence of the country conditions in Hong Kong create a heightened risk of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncoercion or exploitation on Applicant and his in-laws that are not mitigated. See \nResponse to Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, supra, at 4. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly has a father-in-law who is a citizen of \nCanada and Hong Kong and a stepmother-in-law who is a citizen and resident of Hong \nKong. Allegedly, the citizenship status of Applicant\u2019s in-laws remain unchanged. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations. \nHe provided attachments that included endorsements, work history, and limited \nrelationships with his in-laws. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 36-year-old civilian analyst of a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant admitted each of the allegations with explanations. \nAllegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated and adopted \nas relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant met his wife in 2012 and married in June 2018. (GEs 1-2 and AE A) He \nhas no children from this marriage. Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Canada and still \nmaintains her Canadian citizenship. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 54) She immigrated to the United \nStates with her mother (since divorced from her father) in 2005 and became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in June 2019 at the age of 16. (GE 1; Tr. 60-61) Applicant\u2019s father served in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps as a fighter pilot in both WW II and the Korean War and was killed \nin action. (GE 1; Tr. 50, 75-76) His surviving mother communicates regularly with \nApplicant. (GE 1; Tr. 91) \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2009 from a respected U.S. \nuniversity with a dual major in foreign affairs and Chinese language and literature. (GE 1) \nHe earned a master\u2019s degree in global politics from another highly respected university in \nMay 2018. (GE 1; Tr. 87) Within two years of his graduation from his undergraduate \nuniversity, Applicant relocated to China to spend a couple of years (2010-2012) teaching \nfor a U.S. non-profit educational organization. (GE 1; Tr. 44-48) \nApplicant reported no military service but cited his enrollment in a Navy Reserve \nOfficers Training Corps (NROTC) for the first two years (August 2005-April 2007) of his \nuniversity enrollment. (GEs 1-2) Records confirm that he was dis-enrolled from his \nNROTC program in April 2007 for cited ineptitude and charges of making and using a \nfake driver\u2019s license. (GEs 1-2) He was discharged from the Navy under terms of less \nthan honorable conditions with a directive to reimburse the Navy for the educational \nassistance he received. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSince December 2019, Applicant has been employed as an analyst for a defense \ncontractor. (GE 1) His current work assignments include research of potential illegal \nChinese influence in the supply chains of DoD programs. (AE A) Previously, he served as \na fellow for a national consulting group (October 2018-November 2019), and worked as \nan admissions assistant for his graduate school. (GE 1) Upon returning to the United \nStates in 2013, Applicant continued working for the same non-profit educational \norganization in a teaching capacity as a Chinese translator with good Chinese language \nand teaching skills. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 43-44) His employment assignments between June \n2017 and October 2018 included internships and research positions with U.S. education \nand research organizations. (GEs 1-2) \nApplicant has consistently complied with his employers\u2019 requirements for reporting \nforeign contacts and pledged to continue doing so in the future. (AE A) He has no \nproperty interests or foreign bank accounts in China, and his wife is willing to divest \nherself of her inheritance if necessary. (AE A) Applicant has never held a security \nclearance. (GE 1 \nApplicant\u2019s immediate and extended family members residing in Hong Kong \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members have deep roots in the United States and \nhave devoted their lives and fortunes to the security interests of their country. (GEs 1-2 \nand AE A) One of Applicant\u2019s grandfathers served in the U.S. Army in WW II. (GEs 1-2) \nAnother grandfather was a U.S. Marine aviator who served in WW II and the Korean War, \nwhere he was shot down and killed. (GEs 1-2) Applicant\u2019s father worked as a civilian for \nthe U.S. intelligence community and possessed high-level security clearances. (GEs 1-2) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law (aged in his late 60s) is a citizen and resident of Hong \nKong. (GEs 1-2) He is currently married to Applicant\u2019s stepmother-in-law, a citizen and \nresident of Hong Kong (a district of China). (GEs 1-2) Applicant\u2019s personal face-to-face \ncontacts with his father-in-law have been infrequent (no more than five to six times) since \nhe first met him in 2014. (GEs 1-2 and AE A; Tr. 52 and 80) Moreover, of these face-to-\nface contacts, only one conversation involved a direct face-to-face conversation (i.e., \nwhen Applicant asked for permission to marry his daughter). (AE A)  \nApplicant knows his father-in-law to be a past chief executive officer (CEO) of a \nregional retail department store in Hong Kong that maintains trading operations in China. \n(GEs 1-2 and B; Tr. 5663-64) His father-in-law is a past registered elector on the \nwholesale and retail sub-sector of the Hong Kong election committee (a non-government \norganization of Hong Kong), and a member of the Shanghai Hong Kong, Macao, and \nTaiwan Overseas Chinese Committee (part of the Shanghai Political Consultative \nConference). (GEs 1-2; Tr. 63-64) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s reported understanding, his father-in-law was one of about \n80 foreigners on this Overseas Chinese Committee, which was designed to aid Shanghai \nuse lessons learned in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. (GE 1 and AE C) Applicant cited \none July 2021 speech delivered by his father-in-law that he believed to be on the \nimportance of public toilets. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 72-73) Applicant understands that his father-in-\nlaw is no longer associated with either his former Hong Kong retail department store, the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHong Kong election committee, or the Overseas Chinese Committee. (AEs D-E; Tr. 55-\n56, 68-69, and 73-74)  \nNeither of Applicant\u2019s in-laws has any known affiliations or connections with \nChina\u2019s military or intelligence apparatus. (Tr. 55) Further, neither of his in-laws know \nwhat Applicant does for a living. (Tr. 54) Presumably, though, intelligence officials of the \nPRC possess background data on Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and his past association with \nhis retail store and committee memberships. Whether Chinese military and intelligence \nofficials have and maintain background data on Applicant and his wife is unknown. \nApplicant\u2019s stepmother-in-law is also a citizen and resident of Hong Kong. (GEs 1-\n2) She is the second wife of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and does not work outside of the \nhome. (Tr. 55) Applicant sees his mother-in-law once a year and participates in infrequent \nfamily group chats. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 62, 84) Both in-laws attended Applicant\u2019s wedding in \n2018, and Applicant\u2019s wife maintains monthly contact with her father. (Tr. 83)  Applicant \nlast traveled to Hong Kong to see his in-laws in 2016. (Tr. 81)  \nOut of concern for getting too close to his father-in-law, Applicant maintained \u201chis \ndistance\u201d from his father-in-law during his wife\u2019s skype calls spanning mid-2019-early \n2022 and estimated seeing him \u201ctwice over the last, maybe six months\u201d during his \u201dgroup \ntext chats with them\u201d and his wife. (Tr. 83-84) Despite Applicant\u2019s limited contact with his \nfather-in-law and stepmother-in-law since his wedding in 2018, and distance Applicant \nenjoys in the relationship he has with his in-laws, both Applicant and his wife presumably \nretain mutual bonds of affection, influence, and common interests with his in-laws. (Tr. 53-\n54, 83-84) So, while Applicant considers his relationship with his in-laws in Hong Kong to \nbe \u201cdistant, infrequent, and casual\u201d (Tr. 52), the presumption still holds that he and his \nwife, who maintains monthly contact with her father, retain mutual bonds of affection, \ninfluence, and common interests with her father and stepmother.  \nHong Kong\u2019s historical background \nHong Kong\u2019s history dates back over five millennia. It developed strong trading \nrelationships with Britain in 1842 (following the First Opium War) under the Treaty of \nNanking. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 2. Britain was granted a \nperpetual lease on the Kowloon Peninsula under the 1860 Convention of Beijing, and \nBritain expanded its control over the surrounding area under a 99-year lease of the New \nTerritories in 1898. See id. \nIn the late 19th  and early 20th  centuries, Hong Kong developed as a warehousing \nand distribution center for British trade with southern China. See Background Note: Hong \nKong, SAR, supra). Heavy migration to Hong Kong occurred after the Communist \ntakeover of mainland China in 1949. Hong Kong achieved considerable economic \nsuccess as a British colony in the post-1949 period as a manufacturing, commercial, \nfinance, and tourism center. High life expectancies, literacy, per capita income, and a \nconfluence of other socioeconomic indicators serve to illustrate Hong Kong\u2019s measurable \nsocioeconomic achievements. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHong Kong\u2019s reversion \nSince July 1, 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region of  \nChina. This is important to note because of the generally recognized heightened risks that \nare associated with China, and the unilaterally imposed citizenship and residency status \non Applicant and her parents as birth residents and citizens of Hong Kong before the \nreversion. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra. This does not mean that the \nU.S. Government will not offer consular services to dual nationals who use their non-U.S. \npassports in Hong Kong and other sectors of China. However, because China does not \nrecognize dual citizenship under its nationality law, use of other than a U.S. passport to \nenter China can simply increase the difficulties of consular assistance for any dual \nnational who is arrested under such circumstances. See id.  \nHong Kong today has a population of over 7 million (95 per cent of which are \nChinese), and is one of the most densely populated regions of the world. China has given \nHong Kong considerable autonomy over its domestic affairs. China has retained \nresponsibility and control over foreign and defense affairs. State Department records \nconfirm that China has taken an increasingly active oversight role over Hong Kong\u2019s \npolitical developments. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 2-3. \nStill, both the Sino-British joint declaration (1984) and the Basic Law provides \npolitical safeguards to ensure that Hong Kong retains its own political, economic, and \njudicial systems and unique status for at least 50 years after reversion. These legal \ndocuments permitted Hong Kong to continue to participate in international conventions \nand organizations under the name of \u201cHong Kong, China. See Background Note: Hong \nKong SAR, supra, at 2. \nHong Kong, with its quasi autonomy, remained for years a free and open society \nwhere human rights are respected (albeit less so now under closer Chinese controls and \nmonitoring), courts are independent, and there are established traditions of respect for the \nrule of law. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 3. Hong Kong still retains a \ncommon law system from its time as a British colony before 1997 and maintains \nextradition agreements with more than a dozen countries, including the United States, the \nUnited Kingdom, and Singapore. China, by contrast, operates a civil-law system. \nCitizens of Hong Kong are limited, however, in their ability to change their \ngovernment, and the legislature is limited in its power to change government policies. \nSee Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra. Moreover, China still retains oversight \nand ultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision-\nmaking. Any changes in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (such as to achieve full universal \nsuffrage) will require approval by Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, at least a two thirds \napproval by the Legislative Counsel (Legco), and then China\u2019s National People\u2019s \nCongress Standing Committee (NPSCS), which is by no means assured.

See id., at 3-4. \nUnited States-Hong Kong relations \nHong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region of China, who bears full \nresponsibility for its foreign relations and defense, is a customs territory and economic \nsector that operates separately from the rest of China in matters that pertain to its \ncustoms zone. See Fact Sheet, U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, U.S. Dept. of State (July \n2018). Operating in its sphere of reserved authority, it is able to enter into international \nagreements on its own behalf in commercial, economic, and in certain legal areas. See id. \nU.S. policy toward Hong Kong is set forth in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of \n1992 (Policy Act), whose stated purpose is to promote Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity, \nautonomy, and way of life. See Hong Kong Policy Act Report, U.S. Dept. of State (May \n2018); Fact Sheet, U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, supra. Under the Policy Act, the \nUnited States supports Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d \nframework by concluding and implementing bilateral agreements; promoting trade and \ninvestment; broadening law enforcement cooperation, pursuing educational, academic, \nand cultural ties, supporting high-level visits of U.S. officials; and serving the large \ncommunity of U.S. firms, residents, and visitors. See id; U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, \nsupra.  \nHong Kong\u2019s one country, two systems framework was established in the Basic \nLaw of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, as enacted by the \nNational People\u2019s Congress. See id. The Act establishes the policy of the U.S. \ngovernment to treat Hong Kong as a non-sovereign entity distinct from China for the \npurposes of U.S. domestic law, based on the principles of the 1984 Sin-British Joint \nDeclaration. See Hong Kong Policy Act Report, supra; Fact Sheet, U.S. Relations with \nHong Kong, supra. \nHong Kong is active in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives and \nremains an important partner in efforts to eliminate funding for terrorist networks, exact \nstrategic trade controls, and combat money laundering. See Fact Sheet, U.S. Relations \nwith Hong Kong, supra; Hong Kong Policy Act Report, supra, at 2-5. In March 2014, Hong \nKong passed legislation allowing it to adopt the most recent globally recognized \nstandards for exchange of tax information, and both countries have since concluded an \ninternational governmental agreement under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance \nAct. See id. \nCurrently, the United States maintains a strong trade surplus with Hong Kong. In \n2018, it had a trade surplus of $32.6 billion in 2017 and 31,14, billion in 2018, which \nrepresent the largest single trade surpluses of any U.S. trading partner.

Today it continues to undergo rapid economic and social change. \nPolitical power, however, remains centralized in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with \nlittle indication of any change in the foreseeable future. \nChina, with its 70.8 million square miles of land space, is authoritarian in structure \nand ideology and possesses increasingly sophisticated military forces that continue to \ntransform itself from a land-based military power to a smaller, more mobile, high tech \nmilitary that eventually will be capable of mounting limited operations beyond its coastal \nwaters. See Background Note: China, supra, at 14-16. \nWhile not a country historically acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and \ninterests, China maintains a relationship that is much more competitive than cooperative. \nChina operates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the Ministry of State \nSecurity (MSS). These operations use clandestine agents to collect intelligence on \nWestern consortia investing in China who are suspected of involvement in attempts to \ndemocratize China, as well as other pro-democracy groups thought to be engaging in \nanti-communist activities.

Part \nof this can be explained in terms of China\u2019s lack of any cognizable tradition for respect for \ndeveloping democracies and the rule of law. \nState Department country reports on China cite the country\u2019s poor human rights \nrecord. Its noted historical abuses include the suppression of political dissent, arbitrary \narrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. See \nAdministrative Notice Request, supra, at 5-6; 2020; Human Rights Report: China \n(includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau), U.S. Department of State (March 2021). \nOf growing concern to U.S. security interests are the State Department\u2019s latest \nreports of increased high profile cases in China involving the monitoring, harassment, \ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers \nseeking to exercise their law-protected rights and freedoms.

See Administrative Notice Request, supra, at 4-5 \nBetter U.S. export controls can be effective only if they are multilateral in scope. \nWithout effective dual use export controls in place, China can be expected to continue to \nacquire dual use technologies with military potential through the U.S. and other source \ncountries. \nEndorsements, evaluations, and awards \nApplicant is well regarded by his managers, supervisors, coworkers past and \npresent, friends, and U.S. DoD customers who know him and have worked with him.

These \nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and \nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the \nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In \naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into \naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to \nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy \nfactors are pertinent herein: \n Foreign Influence \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited \nto, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. See \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 6. \n Burden of Proof \nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that \nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive requires \nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in \nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance \ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all \nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences that have a reasonable \nand logical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual \ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted fact[s] \nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a \nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance. The \nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to \naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified \ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must \ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or \nmitigation of the Government's case. \nAnalysis \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and stepmother-in-law are both citizens and residents of \nHong Kong and presumably retain mutual bonds of affection, influence, and common \ninterests with Applicant and his wife (a dual citizen of Canada and the United States). \nApplicant is a highly regarded analyst of a U.S. defense contractor with a strong \nbackground in advising executives on complex international business decisions. \nSecurity issues of concern to the Government focus on the citizenship and \nresidence status of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and stepmother-in-law who are citizens of \nHong Kong, a part of China and a country known for its poor human rights record and its \nengagement in economic data collection activities throughout China (inclusive of Hong \nKong) and the United States. \nForeign influence concerns \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nand stepmother-in-law who reside in Hong Kong (which has since reverted to China) might \nbe subject to undue foreign influence by Chinese military and intelligence authorities to \naccess classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. Because Applicant and \nhis in-laws have extended family members who have Chinese citizenship by virtue of \nHong Kong\u2019s reversion to China in 1997, they present potential heightened security risks \ncovered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication \nGuidelines for foreign influence. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s extended family members in what is \nnow the PRC poses considerable security concerns for Applicant because of the risks of \nundue foreign influence that could compromise classified information under Applicant's \npossession and/or control.

While \nApplicant has infrequent contact with his in-laws and considers his relationship with them \nto be distant and casual, the presumed mutual bonds of affection, influence, and common \ninterests that Applicant and his wife enjoy with his in-laws have not been rebutted under \nthe very heavy burden of persuasion imposed on Applicant by current Appeal Board case \nprecedents. To satisfy this heavy burden standard, some evidence of clear and deep \nrooted breaks with his in-laws was needed from Applicant and his wife. Lack of recent \ncontact with his in-laws, without more, was not enough to rebut the presumption under \nAppeal Board precedents. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s in-laws have a deep-rooted history in Hong Kong (for years \na British colony) and are steeped in British culture, free markets, democratic government, \nhuman rights protections, and respect for the rule of law. Neither of Applicant\u2019s in-laws \nhave any reported contacts with China\u2019s military and intelligence officials. From what is \nknown from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s in-laws residing in Hong Kong \nhas any political affiliations with the Hong Kong or Chinese governing bodies. Nor do any \nof his in-laws residing in Hong Kong have any history to date of being subjected to any \ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \nStill, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law maintained considerable visibility while a CEO of his \nretail store in Hong Kong and as an active participant in local Hong Kong business \ncommittee activities. Presumably, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law remains a person of continuing \ninterest to Chinese intelligence gathering officials, notwithstanding his recent retirements \nfrom all of his Hong Kong business activities. \nBased on the evidence developed and governing Appeal Board precedents, the \ncitizenship status and presence in Hong Kong of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and stepmother-\nin-law pose continuing heightened security risks because of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the \nPRC and the latter\u2019s sovereign oversight powers over all of Hong Kong\u2019s domestic affairs \nand plenary responsibility over its external affairs. These risks cannot be minimized or \nsafely reconciled with U.S. security interests without overriding evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nsatisfying his very heavy burden of persuasion rebutting the presumption of mutual bonds \nof affection that Applicant and his spouse retain with his in-laws. \nTrue, the Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per \nse results or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are \ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable \nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another. And, the AGs do take into account of the \ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United States as an important consideration in \ngauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a \nheightened security risk.

ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007) Holding that China\u2019s \nintelligence operations continue to threaten U.S. national security interests, with its \nexhibited authoritarian, anti-democratic (so antithetical to U.S. core values) at work in \nevery phase of its domestic and foreign operations (from its collection activities to its noted \nhuman rights abuses), the Appeal Board has consistently found China to present a \nheightened risk to U.S. security interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 (App. Bd. \nAug. 7, 2019); ISCR Case No. 06-24575, supra (articulating the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard and reversing a grant of clearance due to family members residing in China). \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s expressed sincere and credible commitment to prioritize  \nU.S. security interests when accessing classified information, he may take advantage of \none important mitigating condition: Of full benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder current Appeal Board precedents, however, his demonstrated loyalties to the \nUnited States are not enough under these factual circumstances to neutralize all potential \nconflicts that are implicit in his relationships with his in-laws. The presumption of mutual \nbonds of affection, influence, and common interests that define the relationship of his in-\nlaws to himself, his spouse, and his in-laws are not sufficiently rebutted by Applicant under \nthe evidence presented and governing Appeal Board precedents to enable him to meet his \nimposed very heavy persuasive burden. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole person assessment requires evaluation of Applicant\u2019s continued exposure to \npotential conflicts of interests with his father-in-law and stepmother-in-law who are citizens \nand residents of Hong Kong. To Applicant\u2019s credit, he has demonstrated strong loyalties \nand commitments to U.S. core values and DoD policies and guidelines. Applicant\u2019s work \nand contributions have earned him high praise from managers, supervisors, coworkers \npast and present, friends, and U.S. DoD customers he have worked with. Still, Applicant \nand his in-laws in Hong Kong remain subject to heightened risks of coercion, exploitation, \nand even hostage taking for so long as they remain in Hong Kong. \nOverall, potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's having in-laws who \nare citizens and residents of Hong Kong are insufficiently mitigated to permit safe \npredictive judgments about his ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to \nhis familial relationships in Hong Kong. His demonstrated loyalties and commitments to \nprotecting U.S. security interests, while strong and deeply rooted, are not enough to \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n                                                                Conclusions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \novercome security concerns over his being exposed to heightened risks associated with \nhaving a father-in-law and stepmother-in-law who continue to reside in Hong Kong. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant received the SOR on March 16, 2021. On March 29, 2021, he responded \nto the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On May 4, 2021, the Government \nindicated it was ready to proceed to a hearing. On June 14, 2021, the case was assigned \nto me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case assignment and file \non June 18, 2021. \nOn June 22, 2021, I informed Applicant of the possibility of a video conference \nhearing via the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) system and inquired about his \navailability for an online hearing. When Applicant failed to respond by October 14, 2021, I \nnotified him that I was scheduling in-person hearings during the week of November 29, \n2021. Due to a schedule conflict for the December 3, 2021 date requested by Applicant, \nscheduling his hearing was postponed. DCS was no longer available to DOHA as of \nSeptember 1, 2021, and a new program for online hearings was not yet functioning. On \nFebruary 11, 2022, I informed Applicant that I was scheduling video conference hearings \nvia Microsoft Teams. After some coordination of schedules with the parties, on February \n23, 2022, I scheduled a hearing for March 25, 2022, via Microsoft Teams. \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GE 1-2) were admitted into evidence, and \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on April 8, \n2022. I held the record open after the hearing through April 15, 2022, for Applicant to \nsubmit documentation related to his tax issues. On April 15, 2022, Applicant submitted \naccount transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which were marked \ncollectively as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and admitted into the record without objection. On \nApril 21, 2022, I received through Department Counsel Applicant\u2019s copies of tax returns \nthat Applicant had prepared but not filed for tax years 2016 through 2020, which Applicant \nsent to Department Counsel on March 25, 2022. Applicant\u2019s tax returns were entered into \nevidence as AE B through F. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and state \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for at least tax years 2017 through 2019. When Applicant \nanswered the SOR, he admitted he had not yet filed his delinquent income tax returns. He \nexplained that he had time constraints because of care for his elderly mother, and he had \nmisplaced the tax paperwork needed to file his delinquent returns. He expressed a plan to \nsubmit his unfiled tax returns by June 30, 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to not filing his income tax returns for tax years 2017 through \n2019 are accepted and incorporated as factual findings.

(GE 1; Tr. 25.) From June 1988 to 2000, he worked for a defense contractor. \nHe was granted a secret clearance for his duties with that employer in 1989. At some time \nduring his tenure at that company, he worked on special access programs. (Tr. 27.) In \nOctober 2004, he began working for his current employer, a laboratory that has DOD \ncontracts. He has held a DOD secret clearance for his duties with the laboratory since \nSeptember 2005. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) \nApplicant was married from October 1992 to June 1997. He has no children. (GE 1; \nTr. 23.) He has one brother, who is now 60 years old. (GE 1.) \nTo renew his clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on September 30, 2020. He \ndisclosed in response to a tax-filing inquiry that he had failed to file a return for tax years \n2017, 2018, and 2019. He indicated that he owed no taxes for any of those tax years and \nexplained that he got behind in filing for tax year 2017 and had to file a return for tax year \n2017 before filing his returns for tax years 2018 and 2019. (GE 1.) \nOn October 21, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He acknowledged that he had not filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in part due to \nprocrastination, but also because he had misplaced or lost documents and had issues with \nhis personal computer. He asserted that he typically was refunded about $1,000 to $2,000 \nin federal taxes, so he was certain he owed no federal income taxes for those tax years. \nHe stated that he often underpaid his state income taxes by about $100 to $200 and had \nremitted taxes owed to the state with his returns that he had filed on time in the past. He \nexpressed an intention to file his delinquent tax returns by the end of 2020. He indicated \nthat he can afford to meet his financial obligations and expressed a willingness and ability \nto pay his debts. He added that he planned on filing his income tax returns on time in the \nfuture. (GE 2.) \nAs of late March 2021, Applicant had not filed federal or state income tax returns for \ntax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He \u201clet slip the deadline\u201d for filing his returns for tax year \n2017, and in preparing to complete his tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, he \nmisplaced some of his tax-related papers, causing more delay leading into the 2019 tax \nyear. He also explained that he had some \u201ctime constraints\u201d in that he had been spending \nmuch of his free time caring for his then 95-year-old mother with dementia and behavioral \nissues. He averaged about three hours per day helping her in the evenings and more time \non the weekends. About resolving his tax issues, he stated in response to the SOR: \nTo initiate a remedy for this delinquency, I have spent the past 3 weeks \ncollecting all tax related documentation [for] the tax years 2017, 2018, and \n2019.

(Answer.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that his brother, who had his own apartment in \ntheir mother\u2019s basement, kept an eye on their mother, who had developed dementia by \nage 92. (Tr. 20.) Their mother had caregivers around the clock, but it was up to Applicant to \narrange for the in-home care providers for his mother; manage her medications and \nmedical appointments; and assist her at bedtime. (Tr. 24-25.) \nApplicant was aware of his legal obligation to file income tax returns, but he \u201cjust \npushed it aside.\u201d (Tr. 21.) As one year and then the next passed, he had two and then \nthree years of returns to prepare when the care for his mother became more cumbersome. \n(Tr. 21.) Her health deteriorated from February 2021 until her death in October 2021. She \nwas hospitalized on four separate occasions during that time span for at least a week each \ntime. (Tr. 21.) The issues with his mother were \u201call-consuming.\u201d (Tr. 36.) Even so, he had \nsome spare time to prepare his income tax returns, but he was not as organized with his \ntax paperwork as he would have liked, so did not get his returns done. (Tr. 32.) When he \nreceived the SOR in March 2021, he \u201cdid one sweep\u201d for the documentation needed to file \nhis tax returns, but then put his tax matters on hold because of his mother\u2019s hospitalization. \n(Tr. 38.) He received a notice from the IRS in 2021 about his obligation to file a tax return \nfor tax year 2018. (Tr. 40-41.) It did not prompt him to file his delinquent tax returns. It \noccurred to him to retain the services of a tax preparer, but the issue became \u201cthe \norganization of all the information the accountant needed\u201d to file his returns. (Tr. 36.) \nApplicant had always prepared his income tax returns himself, using commercially-\npurchased tax software. (Tr. 31.) He could afford to pay a professional to prepare his \nincome tax returns. His current annual salary exceeds $150,000. (Tr. 36.) \nApplicant filed for an extension of the filing deadline for his income tax returns for \ntax year 2020. He sent in $500 each to the IRS and state with his request for an extension \nfor 2020 in case he underpaid his income taxes. (Tr. 42.) The October 2021 extended \ndeadline for filing passed without him filing returns for tax year 2020. (Tr. 35.) He testified \nthat the two and then three months following his mother\u2019s death \u201cflew by like it was nothing. \nIt was just kind of in a daze.\u201d (Tr. 22.) He explained that he also had an issue with an \napartment. On the death of his father in 2005, Applicant inherited a 1/8th  interest in a six-\nunit apartment building that was sold in 2020. (Tr. 30-33.) He believes the accountant \nhandling the estate filed an erroneous \u201cK1 1065 Form\u201d on the apartment for tax year 2020, \nwhich he brought to the accountant\u2019s attention sometime in spring 2021. He was waiting for \nthe accountant to file the correct form. (Tr. 33-34.) \nIn late January 2022, Applicant began looking for his tax documents to file his \ndelinquent tax returns. (Tr. 38.) Over the month immediately preceding his March 2022 \nsecurity clearance hearing, Applicant went through four to five boxes of documents and \nsome mail for his tax paperwork. In the process, he discovered that he had no record of \nhaving filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2016, in addition to tax \nyears 2017 through 2020. (Tr. 22, 28.)

(Tr. 37.) As of the close of the record, Applicant had not filed his recently-prepared \nfederal or state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. (AE A; Tr. 33.) IRS tax \naccount transcripts show that, as of April 15, 2022, the IRS had no record of returns from \nApplicant for tax years 2016 through 2020. The IRS issued notices to him about his \nmissing tax return on July 16, 2018 for tax year 2016; December 3, 2018 for tax year 2017; \nMarch 30, 2020 for tax year 2018; and March 8, 2021 for tax year 2019. The IRS received \na payment of $500 from Applicant for tax year 2020 on May 17, 2021. He was granted an \nextension to October 15, 2021, for his 2020 tax return but has not filed a return as of April \n15, 2022. (AE A.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAs of April 15, 2022, Applicant had not filed his federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2016 through 2020. His tax returns for 2021 were not yet due. Section 6012 of \nTitle 26 of the United States Code requires the filing of an income tax return by the tax \ndeadline if his or her gross income equals or exceeds the sum of the exemption amount \nplus the basic standard deduction applicable to him or her, whether or not a tax refund is \nexpected. The tax returns Applicant prepared in March 2022 reflect that his income \nexceeded the threshold for filing for each of the tax years at issue, and that he overpaid his \nfederal income taxes. State tax underpayments were minimal in amount. Even so, \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to comply with his or \nher tax-filing obligations, whether or not any taxes are owed. AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nfederal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies because of his failure to timely file \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019. \nRegarding tax years 2016 and 2020, the Government did not seek to amend the \nSOR to include those tax years. The Appeal Board has held that non-alleged conduct \ncannot be considered in a manner that contravenes the notice requirement of \u00b6 E3.1.3 of \nthe Directive. However, it may be considered for limited purposes, such as assessing an \napplicant\u2019s credibility; evaluating evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; considering whether an applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; or providing evidence for the whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006.) Accordingly, his failure to file tax returns for unalleged \ntax years is not considered in disqualification, but it is relevant in assessing reform and the \nwhole-person evaluation. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his noncompliance with such an \nimportant obligation as filing his tax returns on time. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, given Applicant\u2019s ongoing failure to comply \nwith his income tax filing obligations for several consecutive years. Applicant testified \ncredibly about the care he provided his mother before her death. It reflects good character \non his part and provides for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Yet, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had some spare time that could have been spent looking for the \ndocuments needed to file his taxes. The deterioration in his mother\u2019s health from February \n2021 until her death in October 2021 would not explain or extenuate his failure to timely file \nhis income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019, which were due before 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s noncompliance with his tax-filing obligations appears to have been due in \nsignificant part to his disorganization in maintaining the paperwork needed to prepare his \ntax returns and to his procrastination. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly under his or her \ncircumstances. Applicant indicated during his October 2020 PSI that he planned on filing \nhis delinquent tax returns for 2017 through 2019 by the end of 2020. He made no effort to \nrectify his tax issues until 2022, despite being aware since his PSI that the unfiled returns \nwere an issue for his security clearance eligibility. His mother\u2019s passing accounts for some \nof the delay, but it does not sufficiently mitigate the security concerns in light of the other \nfactors that contributed to his failure to prepare and file his tax returns. Although he began \nlooking for tax paperwork in late January 2022, it was likely his impending security \nclearance hearing that prompted him to prepare his delinquent tax returns. He failed to act \nresponsibly with regard to complying with his tax-filing obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s very belated preparation of his income tax returns is not enough to \ntrigger full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(g). The Appeal Board has reaffirmed \nthat the timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 \n20(g). See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to \napplicants with tax issues by DOHA judges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that \napplicants who only begin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed \non notice that their clearance may be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations when their immediate interests are not imperiled. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant asserts in mitigation that there is no evidence that he owes any delinquent \ntaxes. His prepared returns show that he overpaid his federal income taxes, although he \nmay be assessed penalties for late filing after he submits his tax returns. Whether or not \ntaxes are owed, his lack of urgency in addressing his tax issues is incompatible with the \njudgment expected of a longtime defense-contractor employee with a secret clearance. \nWhile he is likely to submit his returns after he has them reviewed by the accountant, a \npromise of future compliance is not a substitute for a track record of timely returns. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s non-compliance with his \ntax-filing obligations for such an extended period are not adequately mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe Appeal Board has made clear that voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems as those pertaining to filing returns and paying taxes is essential for protecting \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). It \nis well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.q, which he denied. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since January 2020, as a satellite controller. From 2016 to 2019, he was self-employed with either his own or his wife\u2019s business. From 2010 to 2016, he worked as a laborer in oil fields located throughout the Western United States. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps for eight years (2000-2008), including two combat deployments to Iraq. He also deployed to Syria as a contractor shortly after he was discharged from the Marine Corps. He is a college graduate. He is married and has two adult children from a previous marriage and two stepchildren from his current marriage, ages 14 and 15. (Tr. 6, 18-20; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant: (1) failed to file his 2019 federal and state income tax returns, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) owed the federal government approximately $388,950 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2011-2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and (3) owed his state tax authority approximately $24,819 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2014-2015, and 2017-2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). There were two other tax-related allegations in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c), however, I find that they are duplicative of the underlying facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e, and I find fo",

Applicant testified, but offered no exhibits at the hearing. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on December 30, 2021. The record remained open until January \n31, 2022, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He submitted two \ncharacter letters (AE A and B), which were admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.n-1.q, which he denied. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \ncareful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since January \n2020, as a satellite controller. From 2016 to 2019, he was self-employed with either his \nown or his wife\u2019s business. From 2010 to 2016, he worked as a laborer in oil fields \nlocated throughout the Western United States. \nHe served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps for eight years (2000-2008), \nincluding two combat deployments to Iraq. He also deployed to Syria as a contractor \nshortly after he was discharged from the Marine Corps. \nHe is a college graduate. He is married and has two adult children from a \nprevious marriage and two stepchildren from his current marriage, ages 14 and 15. (Tr. \n6, 18-20; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: (1) failed to file his 2019 federal and state income \ntax returns, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) owed the federal government approximately \n$388,950 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2011-2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and (3) owed his \nstate tax authority approximately $24,819 in delinquent taxes for tax years 2014-2015, \nand 2017-2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). There were two other tax-related allegations in the SOR \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c), however, I find that they are duplicative of the underlying facts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e, and I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c. \nIn addition to the tax-related allegations, the SOR also alleged Applicant owed 12 \ncollections, charged-off, and past-due accounts totaling approximately $98,382. \nApplicant admitted in his July 2020 security clearance application (SCA), in his March \n2021 answers to interrogatories, in his answer to the SOR, and during his hearing \ntestimony that he failed to pay his 2011-2018 federal taxes and owed over $300,000. \nHe admitted owing approximately $24,000 in state taxes in his interrogatories response, \nhis SOR answer, and his testimony. He also admitted that he has not yet filed his 2019 \nfederal and state income tax returns. His SOR answers, his hearing testimony, and \ncredit reports from September 2020 and December 2021 establish the remaining \ndelinquent debts.

He was an independent contractor and was required to file quarterly estimated \nfederal income tax returns because he was not subject to employer withholding. He was \nrequired to file IRS Form 1099s. (See irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-\nemployed/self-employed-individuals-tax-center.) He filed timely Form 1040s for several \nyears, but did not pay the federal taxes owed. This practice continued when Applicant \nand his wife owned and operated their small businesses. He has not filed his 2019 \nfederal or state income tax returns. He explained that his non-tax delinquent debts \nresulted from his wife\u2019s overspending when he was away from home working in the oil \nfields and when they used credit cards and short-term loans to fund their small \nbusinesses. (Tr. 22-24, 32, 35, 39, 41) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d and 1.e (non-filed 2019 federal and state income tax return; \nfederal and state tax debt)-$388,950 and $24,819. Applicant testified that he still has \nnot filed his 2019 federal and state income tax returns. He explained that because he \nsued his former business partner in state court when the partner refused to accept \nresponsibility for the company\u2019s debts as he took over the business from Applicant, he \nhas been unable to file those returns. He has hired a tax professional (TP) to handle his \ntax returns. He stated that his TP is working with the tax authorities on payment plans. \nHe failed to produce documentation of any agreements or plans. He further averred that \nhe paid approximately $80,000 toward his federal tax debt in 2016. He did not provide \ncorroborating documentation. He also failed to produce documentation evidencing his \nlawsuit against his former business partner. His stated plan to address this tax debt is to \nsell a home he owns with a market value of between $575,000 and $650,000. His \ncurrent mortgage on the house is approximately $275,000 and he owes between \n$25,000 and $40,000 for delinquent monthly payments. (Tr. 23-24, 28, 34-35, 39-40, \n51) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f (past-due mortgage)-$21,062. Applicant admitted this delinquent \ndebt. As stated above, this delinquent mortgage is the house Applicant plans to sell to \npay his tax debt. He is $25,000 to $40,000 behind on his mortgage payments. The IRS \nhas placed a lien on this property. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 25, 28, 51; SOR answer) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g (credit-card debt)-$9,081. Applicant admitted this delinquent debt. \nHe claimed that his wife set up a payment plan with the creditor. He failed to document \nany payment agreements or payments made. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 43; SOR \nanswer) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h (personal loan)-$4,468. Applicant admitted this delinquent debt and \nclaimed that he had paid the amount down to around $1,500.

Applicant admitted this was a delinquent \nmedical debt and that it was being settled. He failed to produce evidence of a settlement \narrangement. This debt is unresolved. (SOR answer) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.q (four debts related to Applicant\u2019s small business)-$12,593;\n$26,057; $6,940; $13,200. \n \nApplicant admitted that he incurred all these debts for his \nsmall business that he operated from 2017 to 2019. He claims that his business partner \ntook over the business in approximately 2019 and part of the agreement was for the \nbusiness partner to assume all the business debt. The partner failed to take on the debt, \nand Applicant claims he filed a lawsuit against the partner. Applicant claimed he could \nprovide a copy of the court documents to substantiate his dispute with the former \npartner, but he failed to do so. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 32; AE B) \nApplicant produced character letters from two military officers, a retired Air Force \nbrigadier general and an active duty United States Space Force (USSF) lieutenant \ncolonel. Neither have worked with him, but have had other contacts with him. They both \nbelieve Applicant to be an outstanding member of the community and a dedicated \nfamily man. (AE A). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has delinquent consumer and business debts and federal tax debt that \nremain unpaid or unresolved. He also has failed to file his 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. His overall financial problems really started when he failed to pay his estimated \nfederal income taxes from 2011 to 2019, when he was an independent contractor and \nsmall business owner who was required to file IRS Forms 1099. His inaction resulted in \na federal tax bill in excess of $370,000 and a state tax bill of approximately $24,000. \nThese are not circumstances beyond his control. The evidence does not support that he \nhas taken responsible actions to address his debts or timely pay his federal taxes. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide documentation showing efforts to pay \nor settle any of the debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. There is no \ndocumentary evidence showing he made arrangements with the IRS to resolve his tax \nissues or with his creditors to pay his delinquent consumer debt. He failed to document \nhis dispute with his former business partner concerning his four business debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) and 20(d), and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 5, 2021, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 4. (Item 1 is the SOR) Applicant did not respond \nto the FORM or object to any of the evidence offered. Items 2 through 4 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on December 1, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. She graduated from high school in 2014 and college with \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. She is not married and has no children. She began her \nemployment with a federal contractor in January 2018. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) in March 2020. In it, \nshe disclosed that she was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in October 2018, \na misdemeanor. In her SOR answer, she explained she tested positive for marijuana at \nthe time of her arrest, but also had a blood alcohol level over the legal limit. She pled \nguilty and was found guilty of DWI and received 360 days of probation, 35 hours of \ncommunity service, 30 days suspended license, court fees, and she was required to \nattend an alcohol education class. As part of her probation, she received random drug \ntests. In November 2018, during her probation in-processing, she tested positive for \nmarijuana. Applicant\u2019s DWI was not alleged in the SOR. (Any derogatory information that \nwas not alleged will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered \nin the application of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.) (Items 3 and \n4) \nApplicant was subjected to a random drug test in February 2019, while on \nprobation. She tested positive for marijuana. (Item 4) She stated in her answer: \nI take full responsibility for my lapse in judgment. No one person has been \nmore disappointed in me than myself. With grace, [my probation officer] \nforgave my mistake if I proved through my actions that no other offense \nwould occur during my probation sentence. I am cognizant of the fact that \nnot too many offenders are offered this same level of forgiveness or mercy \nthat I was given. With [my probation officer\u2019s] guidance as well as a \ncomplete change of my mindset, I showed that I was worthy of moving past \nthis offense by completing the terms of my probation sentence with \ncomplete respect for the people and system that showed me the brighter \npath to take. The Honorable [Judge] relieved me of my probation sentence \nin August 2019.

She stated that she used it about once every few months at social \nactivities from 2014 to 2016. (Item 3) Regarding whether she intended to use marijuana \nin the future, she stated: \nI do not intend on using this controlled substance in the future because it is \nillegal in the state of [X]. I am also not interested in hindering my ability to \nefficiently perform my job at a professional standard or jeopardize my \njudgment or ability to function as a safe and trustworthy member of society. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2020. During her \ninterview she reiterated that she began using marijuana in college when she was about \n18 years old. She smoked or ingested it in a food substance until about August 2019. She \nconfirmed that she tested positive during her probation in-processing in November 2018. \nShe did not disclose to the government investigator that she had also tested positive \nduring a random drug test for marijuana use in February 2019 while on probation. She \nstated in her answer to the SOR that during her phone interview with the government \ninvestigator in May 2020, the February 2019 positive drug test was not brought up. (Item \n2, 3) She stated: \nThis is solely due to the immense amount of shame and disappointment I \nwas still internally marinating in. To this day, I deeply regret not being \ntransparent with [the investigator]. This lack of transparency stemmed from \nmy inability to forgive myself for my transgressions. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant admitted to the government investigator that in April 2020, after \ncompleting her SCA, she used marijuana at a friend\u2019s house. She was offered food \nknowing it had marijuana in it and she consumed it. The government investigator queried \nher about using marijuana while employed by a federal contractor. She advised him that \nher employer did not conduct drug tests, so she was not worried about being fired for her \nmarijuana use. She was asked about her future intention regarding marijuana use and \nwhether she would commit to stop using it and she said she would stop. (Items 2, 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \nApplicant admitted to illegally using marijuana from 2014 to April 2020; testing \npositive for marijuana use while on probation; and using it after she had completed her \nSCA. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was about a month after she had completed her \nSCA. Prior to then she used it while on probation. Although, she is remorseful for her \nconduct, she has not yet demonstrated a maturity that is required of someone who may \nhave access to classified information. She has not established a sufficient period of \nabstinence or evidence that she no longer associates with drug-using associates, and \nshe has not demonstrated a sincere commitment to not use illegal drugs in the future. \nThe evidence is insufficient at this time to conclude future use is unlikely to recur. She \nhad previously stated in her SCA that she did not intend to use marijuana in the future, \nbut then did so shortly after completing her SCA. Her past conduct casts doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAfter completing her SCA in March 2020, about a month later, Applicant knowingly \nused marijuana. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nApplicant was on notice that the illegal use of marijuana was inconsistent with \nholding a security clearance. A short time after completing her SCA, she went to a friend\u2019s \nhouse and consumed marijuana. Applicant voluntarily disclosed this information to the \ngovernment investigator, but also failed to disclose to him that she had tested positive for \nmarijuana use in February 2019 while on probation. She has not demonstrated an \nunderstanding about the importance of remaining drug-free. Her lack of concern that she \nwould be fired because her employer does not conduct drug testing raises issues about \nwhether she can be trusted to remain abstinent. Her actions cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating condition does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was married from October 2004 until his divorce in August 2016. Applicant has about a year and a half of college credits. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 2003 until July 2016, when he was honorably discharged. He was unemployed from June 20016 until May 2017, while transitioning from the Air Force. For part of that time, from September 2016 until March 2017, Applicant was taking college courses. Since May 2017, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to two factors. First, he was unemployed upon leaving the Air Force. Second, during his marriage, Applicant had always allowed his spouse to handle finances. In 2015, he was separated from his spouse and anticipated their divorce. Applicant did not know that his spouse had not filed 2014 joint federal income tax returns. Upon his separation and divorce, Applicant was unaware of the status of his credit cards.

He was married from October 2004 until \nhis divorce in August 2016. Applicant has about a year and a half of college credits. \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 2003 until July 2016, \nwhen he was honorably discharged.

For part of that time, from September 2016 \nuntil March 2017, Applicant was taking college courses. \nSince May 2017, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. Applicant \nattributes his financial difficulties to two factors. First, he was unemployed upon leaving \nthe Air Force. Second, during his marriage, Applicant had always allowed his spouse to \nhandle finances. In 2015, he was separated from his spouse and anticipated their divorce. \nApplicant did not know that his spouse had not filed 2014 joint federal income tax returns. \nUpon his separation and divorce, Applicant was unaware of the status of his credit cards. \nHe was divorced in August 2016, just after he left the Air Force. (Items 3 and 4.) \nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling $31,015. (Item 1.) Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., c., f., and g. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., d., and e. (Item 2.) More \nspecifically, Applicant answered each SOR as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. ($1,821 owed to the IRS for failure to file his 2014 tax return): \nApplicant\u2019s documents showed that he made nine payments to the IRS under a plan from \n2/22/21 to 8/20/21 (seven for $180, one for $32, and one for $327). This debt does not \nappear on the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Items 5 and 6.) Applicant disclosed this debt \nin his SCA and discussed it in his personal subject interview. (Items 3 and 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. ($14,133): Applicant answered that a financial advisor told him to \nrebuild his credit and let this debt expire due to age. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. ($6,864): Applicant answered that a financial advisor told him to rebuild \nhis credit and let this debt expire due to age. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. ($4,786): Applicant\u2019s documents showed that he made 13 payments \nunder a plan from 8/14/20 to 7/14/21 (12 for $199 and one for $29). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.

($475): Applicant answered that this debt is next in line and should be \npaid in full by the end of October 2021. (Item 2.) \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s documents show payments made to retire SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., d., and \ne. totaling $8,271. Applicant did not produce any documents relating to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., c., \nf., and g. totaling $22,744. (Item 2 and Response.) In his Response, Applicant produced \nan April 21, 2022 letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs verifying his monthly \ndisability benefit ($1,897). He also produced his employment pay stubs from January \n2022 to August 2022 ($1979 every two weeks). (Response.)  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., c., f., and g. \nremain in collections or past due on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. (Items 5 and 6.) Aside from \nthe SOR debts, Applicant\u2019s financial history and current finances are good. (Item 4.)    \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \nA2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns . . . \nas required. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances);  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems did not occur that long ago. They arose in 2015 \nand mid-2016, when he was separated from his wife after 13 years of marriage and \ntransitioning from the Air Force to civilian life after 13 years of service. Applicant divorced \nin August 2016. He became unemployed and was in school from June 2016 until May \n2017, when he found full-time employment. Due to his separation and divorce, Applicant \nwas unaware of the status of many of his creditors, having left those matters to his \nformer spouse. \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances when he left active duty in July 2016 were \nfar from ideal. He was in the midst of a divorce. Applicant was in school and could not \nfind full-time employment until almost a year later, in May 2017. The record shows no \nevidence that he had any financial difficulties in the past. Since May 2017, Applicant has \nhad a stable employment record. These conditions are \u201cunlikely to recur\u201d and \u201cwere \nlargely beyond [Applicant\u2019s] control.\u201d Therefore, the predicate factors of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nand (b) are satisfied. \nThe full application of mitigating conditions to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., \nd., and e. stand in contrast to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., c., f., and g. Therefore, \nthey will be discussed in two separate categories. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., d., and e. \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s income tax debt was resolved by a payment \nplan with the IRS. Applicant complied with that arrangement. Therefore, he mitigated \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. under AG \u00b6 20(g). \nThe record shows that Applicant resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and e. by acting \nresponsibly and by good-faith efforts to repay those debts. That conduct demonstrates \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors).

Therefore, Applicant mitigated those debts under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), (b), and (d). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., c., f, and g. \nApplicant\u2019s answers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 b. and c. were that his financial advisor told him \nto rebuild his credit and let these debts expire due to age. Applicant\u2019s advisor is correct \nthat debts may drop off credit reports due to the passage of time. In the national security \nclearance arena, however, that eventuality is not considered to be meaningful, \nindependent evidence as to the disposition of a debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2018).  ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015. As to these two debts, Applicant has not demonstrated good judgment, reliability, \nor responsible conduct.  Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) do not apply to mitigate \nthese debts.    \nApplicant\u2019s answers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and g. were that that he planned to address \nthese debts in the future. This answer essentially amounts to a promise to pay the debts \nsometime in the future, without any current efforts to do so (such as keeping in contact \nwith the creditors, or negotiating a payment plan that will start at some date in the future). \nThe Appeals Board has previously held that promises to pay, without more, are not \nsubstitutes for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner or otherwise acting in a \nfinancially responsible manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. \n18, 2015).  Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) do not apply to mitigate these debts. \nTo summarize, Applicant mitigated SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., d., and e. totaling $8,271. \nApplicant did not mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., c., f., and g. totaling $22,744. The unmitigated \ndebts are of sufficient magnitude to raise national security concerns. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n Subparagraphs 1.a.,d., e.:  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b.,c., f., g.: \nAgainst Applicant \n  Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains two allegations under Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse (Guideline H). Applicant admitted that he used marijuana, with his use ending over year ago. He admitted using cocaine, with his use ending over two years ago. Next to each answer, he cited a mitigating condition (E2.A8.1.3.1.) of the drug involvement guideline within the earlier edition of DoD Directive 5220.6 issued in April 1999. This SOR was issued on June 25, 2021 under the current Directive, which became effective on June 8, 2017. The origin of these allegations is the August 11, 2020 e-QIP in which Applicant voluntarily disclosed his use of illegal drugs and misuse of prescription drugs. 2 Applicant is 23 years old and single. He indicated that since November 2020, he has lived in a house owned by his parents. However, that date cannot be reconciled with August 11, 2020, the date the e-QIP was certified.

However, unlike his other drug use, \nApplicant purchased marijuana on an occasional basis, and used the drug at a higher \nfrequency.

Enclosed with \nthe letter is a copy of the current Directive. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is dated July 30, 2021. He elected to have his \ncase decided on an administrative record instead of a hearing. On September 14, 2021, \nthe Government sent Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) \ncontaining evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR. Applicant received the \nFORM on September 23, 2021. He was given 30 days to provide additional information \nto explain, rebut, or mitigate the information furnished in the FORM. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received no response to the FORM.

Applicant did not object, and the exhibit was admitted into evidence. See, \nE3.1.20., DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains two allegations under Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse (Guideline H). Applicant admitted that he used marijuana, with his use ending \nover year ago. He admitted using cocaine, with his use ending over two years ago. Next \nto each answer, he cited a mitigating condition (E2.A8.1.3.1.) of the drug involvement \nguideline within the earlier edition of DoD Directive 5220.6 issued in April 1999. This \nSOR was issued on June 25, 2021 under the current Directive, which became effective \non June 8, 2017.

(Item 4 at 9) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s August 2020 e-QIP, he entered his high school \ngraduation date mistakenly as \u201cJune 2020,\u201d rather than the correct date of June 2016. \nHe graduated from college in June 2020, with a bachelor\u2019s degree. In August 2020, he \nbegan his professional career with his current employer as an engineer and modeler. \nHis previous job history for the past four years included student intern jobs during the \nschool year or summer jobs when school was not in session. (Item 4 at 14-21) \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2020 e-QIP, he indicated that he had used illegal drugs \nand misused prescription drugs in the last seven years. He estimated that he smoked \nmarijuana from September 2015 to July 2020. He smoked the drug twice before college, \ndaily to monthly during college, until July 2020, one month after graduating from college. \nBeginning in December 2016, he purchased the drug infrequently then at a monthly \nfrequency from August 2017 to April 2019. He did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture because he did not want to jeopardize a potential security clearance. He used \ncocaine three times from April 2018 to April 2019, but would not use this drug again \nbecause of its adverse effect on him. He never purchased cocaine. (Item 4 at 39-42) \nApplicant used ecstasy once in April 2017, but did not intend to use this \nstimulant in the future because he did not like the drug\u2019s effect on him even though the \nstimulants made him peppy. He never purchased ecstasy. He used LSD once in May \n2017 and mushrooms once in March 2019. He did not purchase either drug. The two \nhallucinogens made him feel out of control. In the last seven years, Applicant used \nAdderall once in high school in 2016 and once in college in 2017. The drug made him \nmore alert in completing school assignments. He regretted using the drug and did not \nintend to use it in the future. Applicant was never ordered or advised to seek treatment. \nNone of the drugs in this paragraph are alleged in the SOR. I will not consider the \nforgoing drugs for disqualification purposes. (Item 4 at 39-42; Item 5 at 2) \nApplicant furnished a PSI to an OPM investigator in September 2020. He \nprovided the same account of illegal drug use and misuse of prescription drugs as he \nhad in his September 2020 e-QIP. Except for marijuana, which Applicant purchased, he \nwas given the other drugs by individuals he identified in his September 2020 PSI. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana twice before college and daily to monthly while in \ncollege, with his last use in July 2020, a month after graduating from college and one \nmonth before he began working for his current employer. Initially he purchased the drug \ninfrequently, beginning in December 2016, then monthly from August 2017 to April \n2019. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana, a violation of federal \nlaw. Use of marijuana, a Schedule I drug, remains a controlled substance under the \nControlled Substances Act, codified at 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 812(c). AG \u00b6 25(c) applies based on \nApplicant\u2019s infrequent to monthly purchase of the drug for two years. His sporadic use of \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncocaine occurred on three occasions and ended in April 2019, more than two years \nbefore he submitted his e-QIP in August 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s use of cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, mushrooms, and Adderall is \nmitigated by the experimental to sporadic scope of the use, combined with the passage \nof time since the use ended. Applicant never purchased any of the above drugs. \nRegarding his marijuana use however, the Government has provided sufficient \nevidence to establish the above disqualifying conditions. Applicant has the burden to \nshow that his drug use is mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use did not end until two months after he \ngraduated from college. Smoking daily to monthly until July 2020 does not equate to \ninfrequent use of the drug. There were no unusual circumstances surrounding the use. \nApplicant\u2019s overall marijuana use was aggravated by his increasing purchase of the \ndrug between August 2017 to at least April 2019. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not fully apply. \nWhile Applicant has acknowledged his history of marijuana purchases and use, \nhe has not provided evidence demonstrating a pattern of abstinence. He has not \nestablished that he has severed his documented ties with drug-using contacts or \ntransformed his environment to one where drugs are not used. Lastly, he has not \nsubmitted a signed statement of intent to refrain from marijuana use in the future, \nunderstanding that future use will constitute grounds of revocation of security clearance \neligibility. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 23 years old and is a graduate of a reputable college. Most of his \nillegal drug use occurred in college and was probably aggravated by peer pressure from \nassociates and college friends. The primary reason for denial of Applicant\u2019s application \nis the lack of independent, corroborating character evidence that reinforces a lifestyle \nfree from the temptation of illegal drug use that Applicant capitulated to in college. \nPresently, insufficient time has passed to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. \nJudging by the totality of the evidence, Applicant has not overcome the security \nconcerns raised by the guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In about the summer of \n2011, he had sexual intercourse on two occasions with a dependent daughter (AB) of a \nU.S. service member. AB was 15 or had just turned 16 at the time. Applicant told \ninvestigators that she was 15 years old, but she told him that she was 19 years old. He \nstated that they remained friends after he found out how old she was, but they did not \nengage in any additional sexual activity. AB later told military investigators that she was \n16 years old at the time of the sexual encounters.1 (Tr. at 44-46, 51; GE 3) \nApplicant had sexual relations in about 2012 with a female who was about 18 or \nolder. She introduced him on Facebook to her friend (XY) who was 15 years old at the \ntime. She turned 16 in early August 2013. Applicant stated that because the first woman \nwas of age, he assumed XY was about the same age. XY lived in the Republic of Korea \n(Korea) as the dependent daughter of a civilian employee of the U.S. military. From \nabout January 2013 to March 2013, Applicant and XY exchanged naked photographs of \neach other. She also sent him a video of her masturbating. (Tr. at 15-17, 31-34; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) The photographs of XY and the video constituted \nchild pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252 and 2256. Under the statutes, a child or \n\u201cminor\u201d means any person under the age of 18 years. \nApplicant transferred to Korea in March 2013. He met XY and her friend at a \nconcert in June 2013. He stated that entrants to the concert had to be 19 years old. XY \nsaid she was 18. Her friend said that XY was not 18, and XY quickly said she was 17. \nApplicant and XY met the following weekend in late June 2013, and ended up in a hotel, \nwhere they performed oral sex on each other and had sexual intercourse. Applicant \ntook a picture of her performing oral sex on him. By doing so, Applicant produced child \npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251 and 2252 and the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ). (Tr. at 13-17, 33-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) The \nfact that he might have thought that she was 17 is not a defense because the statute \ncovers minors 17 years of age and younger. \n1 This conduct was not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used \nfor disqualification purposes. It may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in judging whether \nhe has an affirmative defense, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person \nanalysis. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and XY engaged in a series of graphic sexual messages in July and \nearly August, before XY turned 16. At one point he wrote: \u201cI wanted you!! You were \nsexy. I don\u2019t care how old you are,\u201d and \u201cYou are a complete exception. Even if you \nwere 13, I\u2019d seriously have to consider still doing you.\u201d You\u2019re just to[o] sexy!\u201d (Tr. at 18, \n37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant met XY in a club in late July or August 2013, when XY was 15 or had \nrecently turned 16. XY performed oral sex on him behind a pillar on the dance floor, and \nthey had sexual intercourse in the ladies\u2019 room. Applicant told investigators that it \noccurred in July 2013, and that he still thought she was 17 at the time. He told \ninvestigators that he found out XY\u2019s age when her friend told him in late August or early \nSeptember that XY \u201cwas turning 16.\u201d XY later told investigators that the incident at the \nclub happened in August 2013 after she turned 16. He testified that he knew XY was 16 \nyears old during the incident at the club. (Tr. at 37-40, 49-52; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 3) \nThe only evidence that the sexual activity at the club occurred when XY was 15 \nis Applicant\u2019s statement to investigators that it was \u201clate July, I believe.\u201d (GE 3) I am\nunable to find by substantial evidence that XY was 15 during the second incident.\nHowever, Applicant knew XY was turning 16. If the sex occurred after XY turned 16,\nthen Applicant had to know she was 16 years old at the time, and his statement to the\ninvestigators that he did not know her age and still thought she was 17 was false.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had a married female first cousin who lived in the United States. They \nengaged in a series of graphic sexual messages from about June 2013 to September \n2013. They discussed sending naked pictures to each other. Applicant sent his cousin \nthe picture of XY performing oral sex on him. When he did so, he transmitted child \npornography into the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252 and 2260. (Tr. at \n17-19, 40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant stated that he was unaware of his cousin\u2019s existence until around 2010, \nwhen he was almost 20 years old and she was almost 28 years old. He stated that \u201cthe \nconfusions of adolescence\u201d contributed to his conduct with his cousin. Applicant was 22 \nyears old when he sent his cousin the picture of XY. He has not had any contact with \nhis cousin since he came under investigation by the military. (Tr. at 18-19, 40-42; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3) \nA military criminal investigation was initiated in September 2013 after a service \nmember reported that Applicant had a sexual relationship with XY when she was 15 \nyears old. The investigators reviewed Applicant\u2019s text messages. XY never revealed her \ntrue age in the messages. On different occasions, she said she was 18, 17, and 16. (GE \n3) \nIn a September 2013 message to his cousin, Applicant stated that since he \nturned 18, he had sexual intercourse with two 15-year-olds and was masturbated by a \n13-year-old. In the same message, he self-identified himself as a pedophile. Applicant \ntestified that he did not know why he wrote those messages.

He thinks that he was \u201cplain lying to \n[his cousin].\u201d He relayed in messages to AB and XY that he could only get in trouble if \neither of them told military investigators that he knew they were 15 years old when he \nhad sexual intercourse with them. (Tr. at 36; GE 3) \nOn Applicant\u2019s iPad or laptop computer, the investigators found a picture of XY \nperforming oral sex on him, a picture of XY performing a sex act on herself, and a video \nof her performing the same sex act. Applicant was in possession of child pornography in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252. He told investigators that it did not click in his mind that \nhe had child pornography, and if he had remembered, he would have deleted the files. \n(GE 3) \nApplicant was issued a military protective order (MPO), also known as a no \ncontact order, directing him to have no contact with XY. He violated that order on \nseveral occasions. He stated in his SOR response that he communicated with XY via \nmessenger app, when he asked her what was going on with the case. He testified that \nhe did not intend to violate the order, and he \u201cmessaged her just to tell her that [they] \nhad a No Contact Order.\u201d In other words, he contacted her to tell her that they could not \ncontact each other. (Tr. at 20-21, 47-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant was charged with multiple offenses under the UCMJ, including violating \nthe MPO; committing sexual acts and lewd acts on a child under the age of 16; \nproducing, distributing, and possessing child pornography involving XY; indecent \nlanguage to XY, a child under the age of 16; indecent exposure to XY in the nightclub; \nand indecent language to his cousin. (Tr. at 13-14; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant was arraigned on the charges before a general court-martial. He stated \nthat XY refused to testify against him and they are still friends. The charges were \ndismissed in January 2015 when Applicant accepted an under other than honorable \nconditions discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial. The General Court-Martial Order \n(GCMO) promulgating those actions was issued in April 2015. The SOR incorrectly \nalleged that Applicant was charged on the date of the GCMO. (Tr. at 13-16, 20, 43, 44; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE B) \nApplicant asserted that he did not know XY\u2019s true age, and he would not have \ncommitted the sexual acts with her if he knew that she was under 16. He stated that the \nage of consent in the military is 16, it was 13 at the time in Korea, and he thought she \nwas 17 or 18. He stated that he shared the sexually explicit picture of XY with his cousin \nbefore he learned she was 15. However, federal child pornography statutes cover \nchildren 17 years and younger, and Applicant admitted that he thought that she was 17. \n(Tr. at 13-15, 50-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant stated that alcohol contributed to some of the allegations. He stopped \ndrinking while he was awaiting the resolution of the military charges. He asserted that \nhe has learned from the experience, he has matured, and there has been no additional \nmisconduct since the military.

Applicant described his military charges as follows: \nI submitted a Chapter 4 during the hearing which is a request to get a \ndischarge rather than a court martial. The case had been going on for 20 \nmonths. I had to switch lawyers. I had like 20 minor charges against me. \nMost were dropped or recommended to be dropped. I had won the first \ncase because she wouldn\u2019t testify and it was proven that I didn\u2019t know she \nwas a minor, but after I won that case, they piled a bunch of other charges \non me so my lawyers advised me to just get out because they felt the JAG \nwould keep coming after me until they won. My lawyer said get out before \nI become a sex offender or something like that. \nApplicant never told the psychologist that he had sex with a 15-year-old girl \nunder similar circumstances about a year before XY. The psychologist determined that \nApplicant did not have a mental health condition. He concluded: \nI did not find [Applicant] to suffer from any of the sexual dysfunctions or \nparaphilic disorders described in the DSM-5-TR [Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition]. Likewise, I did not find any of \nthe indicators in [Applicant] that are seen in people at high risk for sexual \noffending. I do not believe, based on his personality disposition and \nbehavioral history, that [Applicant] would have engaged in sexual activity \nwith the young lady in 2013 had he known she was underage. He is not \nconsidered to be at heightened risk for criminal sexual behavior in the \nfuture. (AE G) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his reliability, dependability, \ntrustworthiness, loyalty to the United States, honesty, work ethic, intelligence, and \nresponsibility. His girlfriend wrote, \u201cWithin the first month of our relationship, [Applicant] \nhad an honest conversation with me and told me about the unfortunate situation he had \nin Korea. I knew from the start just from his persona that he was wronged.\u201d (AE C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission.

The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s sexual activities with XY from June to July 2013, \nwhen she was 15 years old; that he \u201cproduced, possessed, and distributed sexually \nexplicit videos and/or photos of a 15-year-old girl\u201d; that he \u201celectronically communicated \nindecent sexually explicit language to a 15-year-old girl\u201d; and that he \u201celectronically \ncommunicated indecent sexually explicit language to [his] married first cousin.\u201d While he \nwas charged under the UCMJ with indecent exposure to XY in the nightclub, that was \nnot alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior reflected a severe lack of judgment and made him \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and 13(d) are applicable to \nall of the Guideline D allegations. \nWhether the conduct constituted \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature\u201d under AG \n\u00b6 13(a) requires further discussion. Applicant asserted that he did not know XY\u2019s true \nage, and he would not have committed the sexual acts with her if he knew that she was \n15. He stated that the age of consent in the military is 16, it was 13 at the time in Korea, \nand he thought she was 17. He stated that he shared the sexually explicit picture of XY \nwith his cousin before he learned she was 15. However, federal child pornography \nstatutes cover children 17 years and younger, and at one point, Applicant admitted that \nshe said she was 17 and in at least one of her texts, she said she was 16. Moreover, he \nkept the child pornography of XY after he learned her true age. He has no defense to \nthe child pornography allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b. AG \u00b6 13(a) is applicable to that conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s married first cousin was an adult when he communicated indecent \nlanguage to her (SOR \u00b6 1.d). They engaged in a series of graphic sexual messages, \nthey discussed sending naked pictures to each other, and Applicant sent her the picture \nof XY performing oral sex on him. AG \u00b6 13(a) is applicable to that conduct. \nApplicant is partially correct when he discusses the age of consent in the \nmilitary. However, it is an affirmative defense, not an absolute defense. For it to be a \ndefense in a court-martial, an accused must prove by a preponderance of the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he \u201creasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 16 years.\u201d See Article \n120b of the UCMJ in the 2012 Manual for Courts-Martial: \nUnder 16 years. In a prosecution under this section, it need not be proven \nthat the accused knew that the other person engaging in the sexual act or \nlewd act had not attained the age of 16 years, but it is a defense in a \nprosecution under subsection (b) (sexual assault of a child) or subsection \n(c) (sexual abuse of a child), which the accused must prove by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that the accused reasonably believed that \nthe child had attained the age of 16 years, if the child had in fact attained \nat least the age of 12 years.2 \nFurther clarification is provided in the Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook, Department of \nthe Army Pamphlet 27-9, which military judges utilize in a court-martial to instruct the \nmembers (jury) on the law. Military judges tailor the instructions to fit an individual case. \nThe following untailored instruction addresses the law in this matter: \nThe prosecution is not required to prove the accused knew that (state the \nname of the alleged victim) had not attained the age of 16 years at the \ntime the alleged sexual act(s) occurred. However, an honest and \nreasonable mistake of fact as to (state the name of the alleged victim)\u2019s \nage is a defense to (that) (those) charged offense(s). \n\u201cMistake of fact as to age\u201d means the accused held, as a result of \nignorance or mistake, an incorrect belief that the other person engaging in \nthe sexual conduct was at least 16 years old. The ignorance or mistake \nmust have existed in the mind of the accused and must have been \nreasonable under all the circumstances. To be reasonable the ignorance \nor mistake must have been based on information, or lack of it, which \nwould indicate to a reasonable person that (state the name of the alleged \nvictim) was at least 16 years old. (Additionally, the ignorance or mistake \ncannot be based on the negligent failure to discover the true facts. \nNegligence is the absence of due care. Due care is what a reasonably \ncareful person would do under the same or similar circumstances.) \nThe burden is on the defense to establish the accused was under this \nmistaken belief, by a preponderance of the evidence. A \u201cpreponderance\u201d \nmeans more likely than not. If you are not convinced by a preponderance \nof the evidence that, at the time of the charged sexual assault of a child, \nthe accused was under a mistaken belief that (state the name of the \nalleged victim) was at least 16 years old, the defense does not exist. Even \nif you conclude the accused was under the honest and mistaken belief \nthat (state the name of the alleged victim) was at least 16 years old, if you \nare not convinced by preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of \nSee \nManual for \nCourts-Martial \nUnited \nStates \n(2012 \nEdition), \navailable \nat: \nextension:// \nefaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/MCM2012.pdf. \n8 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe charged sexual assault of a child, the accused\u2019s mistake was \nreasonable, the defense does not exist.3 \nApplicant had sexual intercourse with XY in about June 2013 when she was 15 \nyears old. That is not in dispute. To be a defense, Applicant must prove that he \n\u201creasonably believed\u201d (emphasis added) that XY was 16 or older. In that regard, I am \nnot holding Applicant to a preponderance of the evidence standard; I am applying a \nlesser standard. Before he met XY, Applicant had sexual intercourse with AB, another \nyoung girl who may have lied about her age. He received contradictory information \nabout XY\u2019s age from XY and her friend. The first time he met XY in person, her friend \ntold him that XY lied about her age. XY described herself in texts as 18, 17, and 16. \nApplicant commented about her age in texts to XY and to his cousin. He provided \ncontradictory statements about her age. I find that even if Applicant had an honest and \nmistaken belief that XY was at least 16 years old, the mistake was not reasonable under \nthe circumstances. The affirmative defense is not available to him. AG \u00b6 13(a) is \napplicable to the conduct. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred more than nine years ago, and there have \nbeen no additional incidents. I accept most of the findings in the psychological \nevaluation, but it is given less weight because Applicant never told the psychologist that \nhe had sex with a 15-year-old girl under similar circumstances about a year before the \nincidents with XY. I also had a difficult time accepting all of Applicant\u2019s statements at \nface value. \nThe bottom line is that Applicant committed serious sexual offenses with a child; \nand he created, possessed, and transmitted child pornography. The status of the picture \nhe sent to his cousin is unknown. The problem with emails, text messages, and the \nInternet is that once something is sent, it is out of the sender\u2019s control. Applicant sent \nthat picture to his cousin during a series of graphic sexually explicit exchanges. There is \nno evidence about whether his cousin deleted the picture or forwarded it to someone \nelse, making it another piece of child pornography that is endlessly circulated around \nthe Internet. Applicant was not the one who was \u201cwronged,\u201d as described by his \n3 See Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook, available at: https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Sites/trialjudiciary.nsf/ \nhomeContent.xsp?open&documentId=80086608B92177D285257B48006924A1. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngirlfriend.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nThe above discussion about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct under sexual behavior \nis incorporated here by reference. In addition to what was discussed under that \nguideline, Applicant violated a military protective order, and he was discharged in lieu of \ntrial by court-martial with an under other than honorable conditions discharge. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n4 See, e.g., Statute of Limitation in Federal Criminal Cases: An Overview, dated November 14, 2017, \nCongressional Research Service, available at: extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:// \ncrsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL31253. \n5 See ISCR Case No. 09-03233 (App. Bd.

Nonetheless, I have unmitigated concerns under the same \nrationale discussed in the sexual behavior analysis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant was administratively separated from the military \nwith an other than honorable discharge for the conduct described in the sexual behavior \nand criminal conduct allegations. SOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges the sexual behavior and \ncriminal conduct allegations. The conduct described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b is identical. \nWhen the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 3.b is concluded for Applicant. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and sexual behavior reflect questionable judgment \nand an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The conduct and behavior \nalso created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the sexual behavior and criminal conduct \nguidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for sexual behavior, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress; \nand it casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, D, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the sexual behavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On \nApril 12, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency issued to Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct.

Applicant timely submitted an undated response to the FORM that \nis marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Items 4 through 6 and AE A are admitted into \nevidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on February 28, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, with explanations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He served in the United States Air Force from 2004 to \n2012, and was honorably discharged. Applicant has never been married and has no \nchildren. He has worked as an aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor since July 2020. \nApplicant worked overseas from August 2014 to September 2016 and from November \n2016 to September 2019, and in the United States since October 2019. He was \nunemployed from September 2016 to November 2016, September to October 2019, and \nfrom May to July 2020. (Item 4) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges one delinquent account totaling approximately \n$27,690, and under Guideline E, that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that \ndelinquent debt on his SCA. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant reported no financial issues in the SCA he completed on August 6, 2020.  \nA credit report dated August 20, 2020 reflects the delinquent account alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a as charged off and closed. (Items 4, 6)   \nDuring a September 2020 interview by government investigators, Applicant initially \nconfirmed his responses in the SCA were correct. After being confronted with financial \nrecords, Applicant acknowledged the past-due debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a was his, and \nsaid he did not report that debt in his SCA because he thought the account was charged \noff and closed. Applicant attributed the credit-card debt to living expenses he incurred \nwhile he was unemployed from September 2016 to November 2016. He reported \ncontacting the creditor on several occasions seeking to lower monthly payments, and \nclaimed his requests were denied. He stated an attorney advised him that it was in his \nbest interest to allow the bill to go to collection and to be charged off, with the \nunderstanding this course of action would negatively impact his credit score. Applicant \nconfirmed he had not paid the debt and said he did not intend to pay it. (Item 5) \nIn his August 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. He attributed the delinquency to financial difficulties since 2017. He \nrecounted unsuccessful efforts to resolve the debt and reported no contact with the \ncreditor since 2017, after being advised by an attorney to \u201cabandon the bank\u201d if he was \nunable to pay it. He said he was working on fixing his financial issues and communicating \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwith a lawyer to see what he could do about the delinquent debt. He denied falsifying \nanswers to the questions on his SCA alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, because he claimed no \nknowledge of actions by the creditor after defaulting on the delinquent account. (Item 3) \nIn his FORM response, Applicant submitted a copy of his answer to the SOR and \nanother one-page document. He averred that improper termination of his overseas \nemployment contract caused significant financial hardship including a requirement that \nhe pay three extra months of rent because he could not provide sufficient notice before \nleaving to accept a lower paying position in a third country. He also noted the background \ninterview did not reflect that after losing his job in September 2016, he focused on paying \nan overseas loan obligation and resolved that loan in early 2020. (AE A) \nApplicant did not report resolving the delinquent account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \nprovided no documentary evidence of payments on that debt. He did not provide \nevidence, documented or otherwise, of his current financial budget, savings or \nexpendable income. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a single delinquent debt of approximately $27,690 dating back to \n2016. He admitted the debt was not resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) warrants some consideration because the SOR alleges a single debt \nthat is not recent. Applicant used the delinquent credit card to pay living expenses while \nunemployed overseas for approximately three months in 2016 and transitioning to a lower \npaying job in a third country. However, he provided no evidence of payment on the debt \nsince at least 2017, and acknowledged the debt has not been resolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot fully apply, since the debt is ongoing. \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment from September 2016 to November 2016, \nSeptember to October 2019, and May to July 2020, were circumstances beyond his \ncontrol that negatively impacted his finances. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore \napplies. However, he did not provide documentary evidence of his communications with \nthe creditor or of his inability to make payments on the debt after he obtained full-time \nemployment in November 2016. The evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling, initiated or \nadhered to a good-faith effort to repay the creditor or otherwise resolved the delinquent \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndebt. To the contrary, he admitted no contact with the creditor since 2017, and stated he \nhad not paid, and did not intend to pay, the delinquent account. He understood defaulting \non the debt would negatively impact his credit score. An applicant\u2019s decision to default \nupon a contractual obligation, even if done upon the advice of counsel, might have \nadverse effects on him or her, including raising questions as to his willingness or ability \nto abide by other obligations, such as those governing the protection of classified \ninformation. See, ISCR Case No. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016). Despite being \naware of the significance of the government\u2019s financial concerns, Applicant failed to take \nappropriate action. His conduct under the circumstances casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09- 08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and \ncandid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility \ndetermination, security clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for \nnational security eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities; \nIn his August 6, 2020 SCA, Applicant denied that in the past seven years any bills \nor debts were turned over for collection, and that he had any credit card account \nsuspended, charged-off or suspended for failing to pay as agreed. During a September \n14, 2020 background interview, he initially confirmed his SCA responses were correct. \nAfter being confronted with financial records, he acknowledged the past-due debt alleged \nat SOR \u00b6 1.a, and said he did not report that debt because he thought the account was \ncharged off and closed. He also stated an attorney advised him that it was in his best \ninterest to allow the bill to go to collection and to be charged off. In his August 2021 \nanswer to the SOR, he again admitted owing the debt, but denied falsifying answers to \nthe financial questions alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, stating he had no knowledge of actions by \nthe creditor after he abandoned the delinquent account. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s denial or explanation persuasive. The SCA is clear on the \ntype of accounts to be disclosed, including those turned over for collection, charged off, \nor cancelled by the creditor. And Applicant\u2019s claims in response to the SOR that his SCA \nresponses were true because he had no knowledge of the creditor\u2019s actions after he \ndefaulted are not consistent with his admissions during the background interview. I find \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent account in his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) \napplies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \nApplicant did not correct his omission until after he was confronted with the \nfinancial records during his background interview. He did not make a prompt good-faith \neffort to correct the omission. He has also provided inconsistent statements about his \nknowledge of the status of his delinquent debt since being confronted with financial \nrecords in September 2020. Deliberately falsifying relevant and material information on \nan SCA is not a minor concern. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 36 years old, was honorably discharged from the \nUnited States Air Force in 2012, and that there is no evidence of additional delinquent \naccounts since 2017. Applicant accumulated a single delinquent debt of approximately \n$27,690 in the past that he has refused to pay. Although his decision not to make any \npayments on this debt may have been a sound financial avenue for him to follow to \neventually put his finances in order and clear his negative credit history, his decision also \nraises potentially disqualifying and current security concerns under the Directive. He also \ndeliberately failed to disclose that debt on his SCA, as required. He failed to meet his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric C. Price \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Based on the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively determine, as \nrequired by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by Department \nof Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance. \nOn March 26, 2021, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The guideline they applied is one of the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December \n10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. I received the case on June 9, 2022, and convened a hearing on \nAugust 23, 2022. The parties appeared as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5, \nwhich I admitted without objection. Additionally, a copy of a list of the Government\u2019s \nexhibits and of a discovery letter dated June 28, 2021, are included in the record as \nHearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively.

Applicant has one adult child from \nhis first marriage and two adult children from his second marriage. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 22 - \n25) \nAfter his discharge in 1989, Applicant and his second ex-wife, who also was in the \nAir Force, stayed in State A until she also left the military. They then moved to State B \nand Applicant began his college studies while also working to support his family. In 2003, \nduring his last year in school, he found work as an electrical engineer in State B, but at a \nlocation about two hours away. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, who homeschooled their children and \ndid not work outside the home, did not want to move. Starting in July 2003, Applicant \ncontinued to pay for their marital residence while also paying to live near work a few hours \naway. This effectively began their separation, which culminated in a divorce in 2014. \nDuring that 11-year period, Applicant paid between $500 and $650 a month to rent an \napartment while also paying just under $1,000 a month for the mortgage on their marital \nresidence. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife took possession of the house as part of their divorce and \nApplicant has had no continuing financial obligation to her since their divorce. (GX 1; GX \n2; Tr. 25 \u2013 26, 54 \u2013 56) \nApplicant stopped paying the accounts listed in the SOR in March or April 2014. In \nlate 2021, the debts at SOR 1.a and 1.b were cancelled by the creditors and attributed to \nApplicant as income for the 2021 tax year. He received an IRS Form 1099-C for each \ndebt and testified that he reported the amounts forgiven ($10,657 for SOR 1.a, and $8,195 \nfor SOR 1.b) as income on his most recent federal income tax return. (AX A and B; Tr. 58 \n\u2013 62) \nApplicant disclosed several past-due debts, including those alleged in the SOR, in \nSection 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP. A credit report obtained by investigators \nshortly thereafter also documents the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant discussed \nthose debts during a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator on \nSeptember 24, 2019. He has attributed his financial problems to his divorce in 2014 and \nto his unemployment between October 2012 and March 2013. He also testified that he \nexercised poor financial judgment, which included following poor financial advice from a \ngirlfriend he had after he separated from his second wife. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 41) \nIn January 2019, Applicant resolved one of the debts he listed in the e-QIP when \nthe creditor filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife to collect a delinquent credit card debt she \nhad incurred in both their names during their separation. He paid about $10,000 to satisfy \nhis part of that debt. In late 2014, Applicant received a letter from another of the creditors \nlisted in his e-QIP to whom he owed about $20,000. The letter demanded payment and \nmay have offered settlement terms. When he got the letter, he contacted an attorney at \nLegalShield\u2122, a legal advice service provided by Applicant\u2019s employer at a discounted \nmonthly rate. He spoke on the phone once to an attorney about what he should do in \nresponse to the creditor\u2019s letter.

The attorney told him to wait until his creditors contacted him to take any action. \n(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 44 \u2013 52) \nApplicant never heard from his SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c creditors. He also has not contacted \nthem or made any payments to them in the past eight years. Those debts have since \nfallen off his credit report because of the passage of time, as required by the Fair Credit \nReporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq. At hearing, Applicant acknowledged that \nhe intended to let reporting of his debts expire rather than initiate resolution efforts. He \nalso acknowledged that the LegalShield\u2122 attorney did not advise him to let his debts fall \nof his credit report. (Answer; GX 5; Tr. 37 \u2013 41, 43, 57 \u2013 58) \nApplicant does not dispute any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not present \nany information showing he has sought professional financial assistance or counseling to \nhelp with his debts. He files and pays his income taxes on time, and he claims he now \nhas a good credit rating and is able to meet all of his current financial obligations. (Tr. 52 \n\u2013 53) \nWhen Applicant started working in State B in 2003, he earned about $50,000 \nannually. When he lost his job in 2012, he was earning about $90,000. For the next six \nmonths, he supported himself and his family on savings and unemployment benefits. \nWhen he started working in March 2013, he earned between $70,000 and $80,000 \nannually. He now earns about $105,000 annually. His current wife earns about $50,000 \nannually. They live in a house she owns, and he pays the mortgage and all utilities, as \nwell as his wife\u2019s monthly car payment. Applicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $5,200. \nFrom that, he pays about $3,200 each month in expenses; however, he estimated that \nhe has only about $500 remaining each month after expenses. (Tr. 45 \u2013 50, 56 \u2013 57, 65 \n\u2013 67) \nApplicant has two credit cards. On one, he carries a balance of about $8,000, \nwhich he testified has been the case for over a year. The other card has a balance of \nabout $2,000. Applicant uses his cards to pay for regular expenses such as food, gas, \nhome-repair items, and so forth. He explained that he uses the card with the higher \nbalance instead of cash because it has a low interest rate. He pays about $1,000 a month \non his credit cards, but always carries a high balance. His wife has her own cards and \npays for them separately. (Tr. 62 \u2013 65) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government\u2019s information supports the SOR allegations that, starting in 2014, \nApplicant accrued at least three delinquent debts totaling more than $27,000. As of the \ndate of the SOR, Applicant had not addressed those debts and they remained unresolved. \nThis information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \narticulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information shows that Applicant stopped paying his debts in the first half \nof 2014 after he had been unemployed in late 2012 and early 2013, and as he finalized a \ndivorce in early 2014. Only twice in the ensuing eight years has Applicant acted to resolve \nany of his delinquent debts. In late 2014, he received a letter from a creditor to whom he \nowed $20,000. He subsequently settled that debt for about $7,000. In 2019, he had to \nresolve a delinquent marital debt when a creditor sued his ex-wife. Applicant was able to \npay about $10,000 to resolve his part of that debt. \nAs to the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has not contacted his creditors or \ntried to make any payments in the last eight years. When he contacted the LegalShield\u2122 \nattorney after receiving a creditor\u2019s letter in late 2014 or early 2015, the attorney advised \nhim to wait until he received any other correspondence before taking action to resolve his \ndebts. The attorney did not advise him to wait for FCRA reporting limitations to take effect \nso the debts would no longer be on his credit report; however, that is precisely what he \ndid. Despite having steady income starting in early 2013, and after his divorce was \nfinalized a year later, Applicant did not initiate any efforts to resolve his debts, choosing \ninstead to let them fall off his credit history. This information shows that he was unwilling \nto pay his debts, despite being able to do so, as shown by his payment of about $17,000 \nto resolve two other debts. The foregoing also shows that he has a history of not paying \nhis debts over at least the past eight years. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe debts alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b are resolved, but only because they were \ncancelled by the creditors as business losses, requiring Applicant to report those \ncancelled amounts as income on his 2021 income tax returns. Even if I were to find SOR \n1.a and 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor, AG \u00b6 20(a) still does not apply because the debt at SOR \n1.c remains unresolved after eight years. Further, his lack of action to resolve \nlongstanding debts undermines confidence in his judgment and reliability. \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(b), divorce and loss of employment fall squarely within the realm of \nunforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances. However, it was incumbent on Applicant to \nshow that he acted responsibly in the wake of those circumstances. The record shows he \ndecided to do nothing of his own volition. Instead, he waited for creditors to contact him \nand was willing simply to wait until FCRA limitations on adverse information reporting \nresulted in his debts falling off his credit history. When creditors did contact him, he made \nsignificant payments to settle those debts. It appears Applicant was able to resolve his \ndebts over the past eight years but chose not to. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \ndid not act responsibly after his divorce and loss of employment. These same facts and \ncircumstances also preclude a finding that he made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nFinally, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) do not apply. Applicant did not present any \ninformation regarding professional financial or credit counseling services, and he did not \ndispute any of the debts at issue. The only advice he sought came from a single phone \nconversation in 2014 with an attorney regarding both a letter from one of his creditors and \nseeking advice about his other debts. That advice, the product of one phone call, does \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nnot equate to financial advice intended to improve his finances or to establish a plan for \nresolving his debts. \nApplicant claimed that his current finances are sound, because he and his wife live \nmodestly and within their means. By contrast, the information he provided about his \nmonthly income and expenses, and about the high balances on his credit cards, raises \ndoubts about his spending habits and overall financial health. More important, his lack of \naction regarding his past-due debts undermines confidence in his judgment and reliability. \nOn balance, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and the adverse impact of his \ndivorce and unemployment on his personal finances. However, it was incumbent on \nApplicant to establish that he acted responsibly in the wake of uncontrolled circumstances \nand that his financial problems will not recur. The record evidence as a whole shows that \nhe did not meet his burden of persuasion. Available information does not resolve the \ndoubts raised by Applicant\u2019s financial history. Because protection of the national interest \nis the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved \nagainst the individual\u2019s request for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at the close of the hearing to allow \nhim to submit additional exhibits. Within the allotted time, he submitted eight exhibits, \nmarked and incorporated into the record as AE B through AE J. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on May 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 41-year old married man with two children. He has been married \nsince 2018. (GE 1 at 23) He was married previously from 2003 to 2011. The previous \nmarriage ended in divorce. One of his children is from his previous marriage and the other \nis from a previous relationship. \nApplicant is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Tr. 14) \nHe served in the U.S. Navy from 1999 to 2004. He received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. (Tr. 14) He has been working for a defense contractor as a \nmanagement analyst since 2019. (Tr. 14) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including $1,641 of delinquent state \nincome taxes incurred between tax years 2008 and 2015, as alleged in subparagraph \n1.a. During this period, he was working as a contractor for a company that was not \ndeducting his projected income tax debt from his pay. (Tr. 16) He contends that he has \nreached out to the state taxing authority, and has settled and paid the debt. (Tr. 16) \nApplicant provided no documentary proof of this assertion. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant did not file his 2012 income tax return on time \n(subparagraph 1.b), and that he has unpaid taxes totaling $3,888 from tax years 2012 \nand 2015, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. As for the 2012 tax return, allegedly \nfiled late, Applicant admitted this allegation, explaining that although he completed it and \nmailed it on time, the IRS returned it because he forgot to sign one of the pages. (Answer \nat 1) He then filed it again, remembering to sign all of the pages. \nAs for the alleged delinquencies for tax years 2012 and 2015, Applicant admits \nincurring these delinquencies. He promised to arrange a payment plan after contacting \nthe IRS to ascertain the exact amount of the delinquency. (Answer at 1) The IRS \nresponded to Applicant on May 12, 2022. According to the IRS, Applicant\u2019s oldest \noutstanding unpaid tax bill is from tax year 2019. (AE D at 1, 3) The other late tax bills are \nfor tax years 2020 and 2021. Applicant entered into an agreement with the IRS under \nwhich he is to pay $100 per month to satisfy these delinquencies, beginning in July 2022. \n(AE D at 1) The IRS correspondence did not include the balance of the outstanding \ndelinquency. \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2016, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.e.

(GE 6 at 22, 24, 29-30) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, totaling $10,811, constitutes the balance \ndue on a car loan that had been repossessed. (Answer at 1) Applicant purchased this car \nin 2018 after the bankruptcy discharge. (AE E) After settling a disability claim with the \nNavy for $30,000, Applicant used this money to satisfy the car loan. (AE E; Tr. 32) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.g. totaling $16,815 is a motorcycle loan \ndelinquency. Applicant has been making payments, ranging between $300 and $600, \ntowards the satisfaction of this debt since April 2018. (AE A at 2; AE C) The current \nbalance is $12,109. (AE B) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h, totaling $7,639, is a car loan that Applicant \ncosigned with his sister. (Answer at 2) Applicant contacted the creditor, and was told the \naccount had been settled. (Tr. 37) As of the hearing date, Applicant was awaiting \nconfirmation of settlement from the creditor. As of the close of the record, he had not \nprovided any evidence from the creditor corroborating that the debt had been settled. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i, totaling $2,037, is a delinquent phone bill. \nApplicant contends that the bill is current. (AE I) Although his current phone bill is from \nthe same phone company of the delinquent phone bill that was reported delinquent on \nApplicant\u2019s June 2020 credit report, the account numbers do not correspond. (compare \nAE I with GE 4 at 7) Moreover, per a June 2020 credit report, Applicant disputed this debt \nand the dispute was not resolved in his favor. (GE 4 at 7) \nApplicant is unsure of the creditor who holds the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.j, \ntotaling $1,205. He suspects that it is a cell phone account that he opened for his sister \nand that she did not pay the subsequent bills. (GE 2 at 3) It remains outstanding. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k, totaling $957, is a phone bill totaling $957. \nApplicant confirmed that this account is current. (AE F) \nApplicant admits having a credit card delinquency, as alleged in subparagraph 1.l, \nbut denies the amount of $763. (Answer at 1) He provided no evidence substantiating the \nlegal basis of his dispute. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m, totaling $385, is a phone bill. Applicant \ncontends that he paid it; however, the evidence is inconclusive. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems before filing for bankruptcy protection in \n2017 to the breakdown and ultimate dissolution of his first marriage. Specifically, his ex-\nwife opened numerous credit accounts, which the family court held Applicant responsible \nfor, as part of the divorce decree. (GE 2 at 2) He attributes the recurrent financial problems \nhe experienced after the bankruptcy discharge to the expenses associated with caring for \nhis elderly, wheelchair-bound father who suffered from a substance abuse problem.

(Tr. 42) Applicant also stated \nthat a series of low-paying jobs and an increase in his child support payments contributed \nto his post-bankruptcy financial problems. (GE 2 at 2) \nIn June 2020, Applicant retained a credit repair agency to help him resolve his \ndelinquent finances. (AE H at 3) Applicant was disappointed with the credit repair \nagency\u2019s services because they continuously told him that disputed debts were being \nresolved, and that they were negotiating settlements with other creditors, but he never \nreceived any confirmation of their progress. (Tr. 33) He characterized their program as a \nscam. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant maintains a budget. He has $2,816 of monthly expenses. (AE J) The \ncopy of the budget that he provided does not include his monthly income. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nHis history of delinquent state and federal income taxes, together with his failure to file \nhis 2012 federal income tax return on time triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure \nto file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to \npay annual Federal state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his 2012 tax return on time occurred because of a good-\nfaith error, as he completed the return, but inadvertently failed to sign it, prompting the \nIRS to return it to him for his signature. After its return, Applicant completed it, and signed \nall of the pages. I resolve subparagraph 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs for the allegations set forth in 1.c and 1.d regarding tax delinquencies owed for \ntax years 2012 and 2015, Applicant contacted the IRS who informed him that although \nhe had a delinquency stemming from several tax years, the earliest year with a tax \ndelinquency was 2019. As for the tax year 2015 delinquency, it was discharged in a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2017.

Consequently, \nthe resolution of the income tax debts from 2012 and 2015 has limited probative value \nwith respect to Applicant\u2019s current financial well-being. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to the remaining SOR \nallegations: \n20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributes the origins of his financial problems to the breakdown of his \nfirst marriage and his subsequent divorce in 2011. However, he incurred the current \ndelinquencies after both the divorce and the discharge of $58,000 of debt through a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. Moreover, although Applicant recently had to spend money to care \nfor his ailing father, he acknowledges that he could have better managed his personal \nfinances and the money spent on his father\u2019s care. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is only partially applicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant retained a credit counseling company to help him resolve his financial \nproblems; however, it proved to be, in his words, a \u201cscam.\u201d Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant receives credit for satisfying the loan deficiency from a repossessed car \n(subparagraph 1.k), and getting payments up to date on the bills alleged in subparagraphs \n1.g and 1.k. These efforts are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant\u2019s dispute of the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m, \ntotaling, approximately $8,800, is not substantiated by any documentary evidence. Under \nthese circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nAs of the hearing date, subparagraph 1.h, totaling $7,629, was unresolved. \nApplicant incurred the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h after he had obtained the \nbankruptcy discharge of $58,000. He has incurred additional delinquent federal income \ntax debt, and his state income tax debt remains outstanding. Under these circumstances, \nI cannot conclude that his financial problems are unlikely to recur or that they no longer \ncast doubt on his security worthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant has made moderate progress in satisfying his delinquencies. However, \nthere are multiple remaining debts that he contends are satisfied, but lack substantiation, \nincluding a state income tax delinquency, and his financial problems recurred after the \n2017 bankruptcy discharge. Moreover, although the breakdown of Applicant\u2019s first \nmarriage and his subsequent divorce led to his original financial problems in the early \n2010s, I remain concerned that his financial problems recurred after the bankruptcy \ndischarge in 2017. Of particular concern is the fact that some of these recurrent \ndelinquencies are tax debts. Under these circumstances, the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence of his financial problems remains an unacceptable security risk. \nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is \nbased on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, as set forth in the \nDirective, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant\u2019s current circumstances, a \nclearance is not recommended, but should he be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his \nsecurity worthiness, particularly if he continues to comply with the payment plans that he \nhas arranged. It is simply too soon at this time to conclude that he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns given the recurrence of his delinquent debts \nand the fact that some of the recurrent delinquent debts are income taxes. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l \u2013 1.n:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On April 17, 2018, the laboratory reported his \nurinalysis test results, having detected 447 ng/mL of benzoylecgonine (cocaine \nmetabolite) utilizing sophisticated testing methods. The ng/mL cutoff for a positive test \nresult was 100 ng/mL. (Tr. 52-53, 89; GE 2) [Note \u2013 I have not considered Applicant\u2019s \n2017 reckless driving conviction in determining his security clearance eligibility, since it \nwas not alleged in the SOR.] \nAfter Applicant\u2019s probation officer (PO) informed him that he had tested positive \nfor cocaine, Applicant requested a retest. His PO warned him that if he failed the \nurinalysis test again, he would be required to go to court and possibly be sentenced to \njail. Applicant stated he \u201cwas afraid of this, so she (PO) told me just to wait till next \nweek\u201d to take a urinalysis retest. He stated that he retook the urinalysis test the \nfollowing week and passed it. (Tr. 53-54, 92-94) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer, he denied this allegation stating, \u201cI have never used \ncocaine, and I do not take illegal drugs. It is my belief that this test result was a false \npositive, as I was told immediately after the test that I did not pass, and I was asked to \nretake the test. I retook the test the following week and passed without issue. I have no \nidea why I would have a false positive test result, but I am completely confident and \ncertain in the statement that I do not, and have not, used illegal drugs, including \ncocaine.\u201d (SOR Answer) In Applicant\u2019s June 2020 SF-86, he also denied any use of \nillegal drugs in the past seven years and answered \u201cno\u201d to all questions relating to \ndrugs. (GE 1) Similarly, he denied any use of illegal drugs in his February 2021 DOHA \nInterrogatories. (GE 2) \nDuring Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination, Applicant stated that the April \n2018 ASAP drug test was the first drug test he took while on probation with ASAP. He \nhas no explanation as to how cocaine could have gotten into his system. He does not \nassociate with people who use cocaine. (Tr. 67-69, 89-91) Applicant\u2019s PO informed him \nthat he might go back to jail if his drug test came back positive a second time. He \nopined that [his PO] was, \u201cmore than likely was just trying to scare me . . . .\u201d His PO \nthen advised him, \u201cto take it again next week.\u201d (Tr. 69) The following question and \nanswer followed between Department Counsel and Applicant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMS.

(AE G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. Although Applicant stated the debt is SOR \u00b6 1.d \nbelonged to his father as he and his father have similar names, Applicant later \nconceded post-hearing that the debt was his and paid it off. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are partially applicable, and AG \u00b6 20(c) is fully applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation deteriorated when his wife experienced serious medical \nissues beginning in 2013 that continued to at least 2018. She was unable to work and \nwas on medical leave or in a non-pay status. Applicant\u2019s financial situation deteriorated \nfurther when he lost his job in 2018 and was unemployed from March to June 2018. \nApplicant received financial counseling in 2020 through his DCC before his April 2021 \nSOR was issued. \nApplicant does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) because he \ndid not take affirmative action to repay several of his creditors until they sued him. That \nsaid, Applicant resolved all but three of his 16 alleged debts. Two of the alleged debts \nare duplicate accounts that were sold to successor creditors. Three of the 16 debts are \nin the process of being resolved. Applicant is making payments on two of those \naccounts. The remaining student loan account is on a \u201cCollections Pause\u201d as a result of \nCOVID, and he is awaiting further guidance from DoEd. Applicant provided the vast \nmajority of his mitigating documentation under this concern post-hearing. \nApplicant recognized that his finances were out of control and retained a DCC in \n2020. He participated in the DCC\u2019s financial counseling and utilized their services until \nhe was able to move forward on his own. Several of his creditors sued him to recover \nmoney owed to them, prompting Applicant to cash out a portion of his 401k account to \nrepay them. It would have been preferable for Applicant to have remained in contact \nwith those creditors and sought a resolution short of litigation. With that said, he has \nlearned a valuable lesson and come a long way in regaining financial responsibility. \nWith ten years of clearance history, he knew regaining control of his finances was \nessential to qualify for a security clearance and took reasonable steps to resolve his \ndebts. \nWith regard to the debts he did not completely satisfy, he set up payment plans \nto satisfy his creditors. The Appeal Board has established the following basic guidance \nfor adjudications in cases such as this: \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations \nomitted). \nWhen considering where Applicant was when this process began, I note that he \nhas made considerable progress in addressing his debts. When he regained his \nfinancial foothold, Applicant took reasonable corrective action. He liquidated a portion of \nhis 401k account to pay off his larger creditors. He paid or resolved the majority of his \ndebts before his hearing, and is well on the way to regaining financial responsibility. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern concerning drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25 provided two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above \ndefinition);\u201d and \u201c(b) testing positive for an illegal drug.\u201d The evidence of record \nestablishes security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b). Further review is \nnecessary. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility;  \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \nApplicant claimed at his hearing that he never used cocaine and that the April \n2018 positive test result was a false positive. Furthermore, he said he had no idea how \ncocaine could have gotten in his system, if it did. To review, Applicant was required to \nparticipate in a random drug test administered by his local county ASAP as a condition \nof his probation following his 2017 conviction for reckless driving. He provided a urine \nsample on April 11, 2018, the testing laboratory received the sample on April 12, 2018, \nand the laboratory reported that his sample was positive for Benzoylecgonine (Cocaine \nMetabolite) with a 447 ng/mL level. The cutoff level was 100 ng/mL. He did not submit \nany evidence that the test itself or testing facility procedures were flawed or unreliable. \nNor did he request that his sample be retested. Rather, after discussing the positive test \nresults with his PO, he stated that he waited to take a retest a week later and his results \nwere negative. There is no evidence in the record that addresses the length of time \ncocaine remains in one\u2019s system, or confirms that his second test was negative. \nApplicant did not provide a convincing explanation for testing positive for cocaine \non his April 2018 urinalysis that would refute his unlawful use of it. \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered \nstating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId.

See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). I limited my consideration of \nApplicant\u2019s false denials of cocaine use in 2018 to the five purposes listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when such conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For \nthe recency analysis the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although\nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did\nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal\nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by\nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that\nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case)\nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd.

Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, affirmed \nthe administrative judge\u2019s decision to revoke an applicant\u2019s security clearance after \nconsidering the judge\u2019s recency analysis, stating:  \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and \nserious history of improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant \nwho was familiar with the security clearance process.

Nov. 23, 2004) (sustaining denial of \nsecurity clearance for Applicant who used marijuana five times while holding a security \nclearance with four years between most recent marijuana use and hearing). \nThe passage of time after ending drug use is not considered in isolation. \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent denials of drug use in his June 2020 SF-86, his September \n2020 background interview, his February 2021 DOHA interrogatory responses, his June \n2021 SOR Answer, and his hearing testimony are indicative of his poor rehabilitative \npotential. See ISCR Case No. 06-18270 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (marijuana use \nafter completing an SF-86 \u201cundercuts\u201d favorable application of the drug involvement \nrecency mitigating condition). \nApplicant held a clearance for ten years and was therefore familiar with the \nrequirements of maintaining a clearance. Although he was not employed at the time he \ntested positive for cocaine, his knowledge and experience of the clearance process \nshould have heightened his awareness that any drug use raised serious security \nconcerns, particularly while on probation. His subsequent denials of illegal drug use, in \nan apparent attempt to undermine the system, raise serious doubts about his credibility \nand rehabilitative potential. Otherwise, a three-year-old single use of cocaine with \ndocumented favorable mitigating evidence might well have resulted in a more favorable \noutcome. When an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his own \nactions, such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and \nrehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case 21-00321 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 8, 2022). None of the \nmitigating conditions were established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.

He seeks to retain his Top Secret security clearance, which \nis a requirement of his continued employment. He has successfully held a clearance \nwith several Government agencies for approximately ten years, and is familiar with the \nrequirements to hold a clearance. He has accumulated experience in the defense \nindustry and is well regarded by his colleagues and friends. \nApplicant\u2019s wife encountered significant medical issues that required extensive \nmedical care and resulted in her not being able to work. Added to that, Applicant was \nunemployed for four months in 2018. Unable to remain current on his financial \nobligations, he fell into debt. He began his financial recovery in 2020 when he retained \nthe services of a DCC. He then completed financial counseling, liquidated a portion of \nhis 401k to repay creditors, and paid as many creditors as he could or set up payment \nplans. Although the documentation submitted at his hearing fell short, he corrected that \nshortfall with his post-hearing submissions. Applicant clearly recognizes the importance \nof regaining financial responsibility and he understands what he needs to do to maintain \nfinancial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d of debt repayment. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s insufficient attempt to justify testing positive for cocaine in \n2018 does not establish mitigation of security concerns caused by his cocaine use in \n2018. An applicant at his age, and with his education and experience, is expected to \nknow better. His explanations for testing positive for cocaine were not convincing or \nplausible, and are not accepted as credible. To his credit, he mitigated financial \nconsiderations concerns; however, the same cannot be said for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse concerns. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n15 \n  Subparagraph 2.a: \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the Guideline H allegations, with explanations. However, his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.d when considered with his explanation is essentially a denial and will be treated as such. He failed to address the Guideline E allegation by admitting or denying it. Since all the Guideline E allegations re-allege the same underlying conduct as alleged under Guideline H, I will treat Applicant\u2019s Guideline H admissions/denial as applying to the Guideline E allegations. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He is divorced, but currently cohabitating with his ex- wife. They have two children, ages 18 and 19. He works as a principal engineer for a software team.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the Guideline H allegations, \nwith explanations. However, his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.d when considered with his \nexplanation is essentially a denial and will be treated as such. He failed to address the \nGuideline E allegation by admitting or denying it. Since all the Guideline E allegations \nre-allege the same underlying conduct as alleged under Guideline H, I will treat \nApplicant\u2019s Guideline H admissions/denial as applying to the Guideline E allegations. I \nadopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He is divorced, but currently cohabitating with his ex-\nwife. They have two children, ages 18 and 19. He works as a principal engineer for a \nsoftware team. He has worked for his current defense contractor since 2009. He also \nworked for a defense contractor from 2001 to 2009. Both contractors are subject to the \ndrug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. Applicant holds a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He has held a security clearance since 2003. (Tr. 16-17, 27-28; GE 1, 4) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used and purchased marijuana from about January \n1994 to about March 2019; that he used and purchased marijuana from about January \n1994 to about March 2019, while granted access to classified information; and that he \nwas arrested for possession of marijuana in March 1996. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) The same \nallegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.e are established by Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) \nadmissions and his admissions in his SOR answer. (GE 1-2; SOR answer) \nApplicant started using marijuana in approximately 1994 when he was 18 years \nold. He continued to use marijuana intermittently over the years while having some \nsubstantial time gaps between uses. As stated above, he first obtained a security \nclearance in 2003 and he admitted using marijuana numerous times from 2003 to 2006 \nwhile holding a clearance. He further admitted that he knew in 2003 that holding a \nsecurity clearance and using marijuana was incompatible. He justified his use of \nmarijuana by saying, although illegal, he did not think it was serious. He typically used \nmarijuana in a social setting with friends. He frequently visited a friend\u2019s ranch every two \nto three months where he used marijuana.

He continued his use at the \nfrequency of twice a week through 2021. His last two uses were in April 2021 and \nAugust 2021, both were after the issuance of his SOR. (Note: Applicant\u2019s two 2021 uses \nwere not alleged in the SOR so I will not use that evidence for disqualification purposes, \nhowever, I can consider it in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in determining the \napplicability of any mitigating conditions, and in the application of the whole-person \nfactors.) He admitted to purchasing marijuana on occasion. He continues to associate \nwith friends who use marijuana in his presence. Applicant denied using marijuana while \ngranted access to classified information. The Government failed to present any \nevidence establishing Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while he was granted access to \nclassified information or when holding a sensitive position. (Tr. 27-28, 30-31; GE 1; \nSOR answer) \nApplicant admitted to an investigator during his background investigation that he \nintended to continue using marijuana in the future. In his SOR answer, he confirmed his \nintention to continue his marijuana use. He justified his position by stating that \nmarijuana provided him some health benefits and because it has been legalized in \nseveral states. During his hearing testimony, he stated he would not use in the future as \nlong as it remained illegal under Federal law. (Tr. 32, 37; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted his arrest in 1994 for marijuana possession. He was charged, \nbut the charges were later dismissed. He was required to complete community service. \nHe has not participated in a drug evaluation or counseling. (Tr. 34-35; GE 3) \nApplicant presented documentation reflecting that he was recognized by his \nemployer as an outstanding employee. He also presented several years\u2019 worth of \nperformance appraisals where he was rated as \u201cexceeding expectations.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana at various times between 1994 and \n2019, and he was arrested for possession of marijuana in 1994. On multiple occasions \nhe conveyed his intent to use marijuana in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), AG 25(c), and AG \n25(g) apply. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2003, but there is no evidence that \nhe was granted access to classified information or held a sensitive position when he \nused marijuana. Eligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access \nto classified information are not synonymous concepts. They are separate \ndeterminations. The issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an \nindividual is eligible for access to classified national security information up to a certain \nlevel. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an individual access to \nclassified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified materials, an individual \nmust have not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed a \nnondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at \n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s intermittent use of marijuana, which spans 25 years, with multiple \nuses after he held a security clearance, casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His two most recent uses came after his SOR was \nissued in March 2021. He continues to associate with friends who use marijuana. He \nexpressed his intent to use marijuana in the future, although he somewhat tempered \nthat expressed intent during his testimony. He has not received any drug counseling. \nNone of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse is cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because that conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe analysis under Guideline H applies equally here. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s years of \ncontractor employment and his excellent employment record. However, I also \nconsidered that he used marijuana multiple times, and as recently as August 2021, \nwhile holding a security clearance even though he knew such behavior was \nincompatible with holding a security clearance. His continued and recent marijuana use, \nwhile holding a security clearance, demonstrates that he does not possess the \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment to hold a security clearance.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and Guideline E, personal contact. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFor\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:\n Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

All service ended with an honorable discharge. He \nseeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since his time in the military. He \nattended college for several years, but he has not earned a degree. He is married for \nthe second time after his first marriage ended in divorce. He has three children between \nthe ages of 20 and 25 and an adult stepchild. (Tr. at 13-25, 28, 40; 50, 52; GE 1, 6) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He lost a job in 2010 because he \nwas ineligible for a clearance upgrade because of his finances. The DOD issued an \nSOR to him in 2014. That SOR was withdrawn because Applicant was able to bring his \nfinances back in line. (Tr. at 54-56, 70; GE 1, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s finances once again became problematic because he was required to \nmake high child support payments of $1,000 per month; his daughter wrecked their \nvehicle in 2016, requiring the purchase of a used car; his wife is disabled and unable to \nwork; and he pays his disabled sister-in-law $200 per month to help her out. His father \nbecame ill and passed away in 2016. There were expenses related to traveling cross \ncountry to visit him and to attend the funeral. His youngest child has autism and his \nsecond child also has some special needs. He continues to pay his ex-wife even though \nhis children have reached majority and the child-support order is no longer in effect. (Tr. \nat 19, 23-2, 41, 48-49, 52-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $27,900. The debts include \na $629 public utilities debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $1,970 debt to a landlord of an apartment \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); six defaulted student loans totaling about $21,956 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.h); two \nmedical debts totaling $147 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j); and a $3,199 payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.k). \nApplicant owed all of the debts at one time, but all of the debts have been paid, settled, \nbrought current, or otherwise resolved. Specific debts are addressed below. \nApplicant paid or settled debts that were not alleged in the SOR before the SOR \nwas issued. He paid or settled debts to American Express and Capital One in 2019. (Tr. \nat 73; GE 2-5) \nApplicant paid the $629 utilities debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in July 2021. The debt was for \ntheir final electric bill before they moved. He forgot about it before the DOD bought it to \nhis attention. (Tr. at 35-37, 56-57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s previous apartment had a bedbug infestation. The landlord hired an \nexterminator and billed Applicant (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant believed his neighbors brought \nin the bedbugs, and he should not have had to pay for the exterminator. He relented \nafter receiving the SOR and paid the debt in October 2021. (Tr. at 37-39, 57-59; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B) \nApplicant was on a $5 per month rehabilitation program for his student loans \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.h) from 2019 through March 2020. The student-loan pause brought on \nbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic stopped the rehabilitation program. Applicant has \nbeen approved for a consolidation loan. He will resume payments when the pause is \nover.

(Tr. at 44-49, 51-52, 63-70, 73; AE L-Q) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant was required to make high child support payments of $1,000 per \nmonth, which he continues to pay without a court order for his special-needs children; \nhis daughter wrecked their vehicle; his wife is disabled and unable to work; he pays his \ndisabled sister-in-law $200 per month; and he traveled cross country to visit his ill father \nand to attend his funeral. Some of those events were clearly outside his control, and \nsome he took on voluntarily. \nApplicant paid or settled debts to American Express and Capital One before the \nSOR was issued. All of the SOR debts are paid, settled, bought current (student loans), \nor otherwise resolved (medical debts). \nApplicant\u2019s previous financial issues give some pause, but I am convinced that \nhe has learned from this experience and that his financial problems are behind him. He \nacted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Security concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.1 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n1 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nissues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances. \n6 \n",

He has worked for \nhis current employer since July 2020. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that he earned in \n2018 and a master\u2019s degree that he earned in 2020. He is married without children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 28, 41; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant was diagnosed at a young age with a medical condition and placed on \nmedication. In 2008, when he was 13 years old, he was charged as a juvenile with three \ncounts of assault. He stated that he was in summer camp, blacked out, lost control of \nhis anger, and the next thing he remembers he was in handcuffs. (Tr. at 12-21; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant was charged in May 2012 with assault and public peace \u2013 interference \nwith school \u2013 impede staff. He was 17 years old at the time. He was convicted of the \nlesser offense of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to probation for a year. His \nrecord was expunged. Applicant was being escorted to the Dean\u2019s office by a security \nguard for using the bathroom without a hall pass. He stated that he was grabbed by the \nsecurity guard and, in response, punched the guard in the head. (Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant was charged in August 2012 with harassing communication. He stated \nthat he was going through a rough time with his family. He argued with his stepfather, \ngot in his face, and yelled at him. The disposition of this case is not in evidence, but it \ndoes not appear that Applicant was convicted of any offense. (Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant was in college in February 2018, when he was in the library and \naggressively tried to meet a female student. She reported that he frightened her, backed \nher against the wall, grabbed her wrist, and started to pull her toward the door. She \nrefused to leave. He grabbed her phone, told her to unlock it, and put his number in the \nphone. Applicant stated that he was attempting to become more extroverted, and he \nthought he was just flirting with the student. (Tr. at 38-41, 47; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-3, 5) \nThe student reported the incident to the police. Applicant was charged with the \nfelony charge of kidnapping, and the misdemeanor charges of harassment, computer \ncrime \u2013 unauthorized access, and false imprisonment. The charges were dismissed \npursuant to a pretrial diversion program. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3, 5; AE \nB) \nApplicant started smoking marijuana in about 2012, the same year his state \nlegalized recreational marijuana use under state law for adults. His use increased until \nhe was smoking marijuana several times a day. He continued to smoke marijuana until \nabout November 2019.

He went to a recovery group through his \nchurch. He has not used marijuana or any illegal drug since November 2019. He stated \nthat he now feels, eats, and speaks better than when he was using marijuana. He has \nan easier time controlling his emotions. He is a powerlifter and is able to lift heavier \nweights. He provided a signed statement of intent to remain completely drug free and \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. at 14, \n30-32; AE A) \nApplicant has been under the care of a psychiatrist since he was a child. The \npsychiatrist testified that Applicant was diagnosed with affective dysregulation disorder, \nwhich meant that Applicant had difficulty regulating his anger and anxiety. Treatment \nincluded a lengthy residential stay, psychoanalysis, intensive outpatient psychotherapy \nfour times a week for years, and medication management. The psychiatrist indicated \nthat people with Applicant\u2019s problem are attracted to marijuana because it provides \nshort-term relief from anxiety and an elevation of mood. Applicant continues to see the \npsychiatrist twice a month. He is on medication, but much less than when he was \nyounger, and his psychiatrist stated that he is in recovery. (Tr. at 12-21; GE 4; AE B) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2020. He intentionally failed to report his illegal drug use. He stated that he was \nadvised by a co-worker that \u201cyou want to be honest, but you don\u2019t want to be too honest \nbecause you say too much, you know, you might get denied your clearance,\u201d and that \n\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t say something if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come up.\u201d Applicant stated \nthat he did not think his marijuana use was relevant because he was \u201cnot that kind of \nperson anymore.\u201d He stated that he deeply regrets it, but he was honest about \neverything else. (Tr. at 35-38, 48-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant did not correct the falsification when he was interviewed for his \nbackground investigation in August 2020. He finally revealed his marijuana use in \nNovember 2020 when he was confronted with a workplace issue wherein he was \ndiscussing marijuana use. He told the investigator that he did not report his marijuana \nuse on the SF 86 because he was scared and did not know if he had to report it \nbecause marijuana was legal in his state. (Tr. at 41-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2) \nApplicant called witnesses who testified to his excellent job performance and \nmoral character. He is praised for his work ethic, professionalism, dedication, and \nintegrity.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana from about 2012 through November \n2019. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after November 2019. I find that \nApplicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that illegal \ndrug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. The aspects of the \nbehavior reflecting questionable judgment will be addressed further under personal \nconduct. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information about his marijuana use on the \n2020 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct is alleged under Guideline E, and his \nmarijuana use is cross-alleged under Guideline E. His criminal conduct and illegal drug \nuse reflect questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in 2008 when he was a 13-year-old juvenile is too remote to \nbe of security significance. That conduct is mitigated. SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for \nApplicant. \nApplicant was 17 years old in 2012 when two of his charges took place. \nHowever, in light of his ongoing illegal activities, the conduct remains relevant. \nI believe that the incident in the library in 2018 resulted from Applicant \nmisreading the situation and not from an actual kidnapping attempt. However, it falls \ninto Applicant\u2019s pattern of poor judgment and bad decisions. He has a history of minor \noffenses, used marijuana essentially on a daily basis through November 2019, and lied \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout it on his SF 86 and during his initial interview. While I believe that specific conduct \n(marijuana use) is unlikely to recur, I am unable to conclude that other problematic \nconduct is unlikely to recur. The above mitigating conditions are insufficient to overcome \nongoing concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance \nmisuse), but he did not mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E (personal \nconduct). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h, and 1.k, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 1.j, all without explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old. He has been employed as an airplane mechanic by a defense contractor since 2020. This is his first application for a security clearance. He graduated high school in 1982. He has been married since 1984, and has one adult daughter, and two adult step-children. (Item 3) Applicant has had several periods of unemployment. He was laid off from his job of ten years in December 2017, and was then unemployed until June 2018. He became reemployed for about seven months, but left that job in January 2019 because there was not enough work for him, and he had a long commute. He obtained a new job in March 2019 for about eight months, but lost it due to budget cuts. He was unemployed from November 2019 to August 2020, before obtaining his current job. He asserts that these periods of unemployment caused him financial distress. (Items 2, 3, 4) In his background interview, Applicant stated that when his bills became delinquent, he worked with his creditors to continue making payments.

On March 20, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. He responded to the SOR on April 30, 2021, and requested a decision \nby an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on \nthe administrative (written) record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn November 19, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) including Items 1-6. A complete copy of the FORM was \nprovided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.

Item 3 is his 2020 SCA. Item 4 is a summary of his October 2020 interview \nwith a government investigator. Items 5 and 6 are his February 2021 and September \n2020 credit reports, respectively. Items 3 \u2013 6 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h, and 1.k, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.i \u2013 1.j, all without explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old. He has been employed as an airplane mechanic by a \ndefense contractor since 2020. This is his first application for a security clearance. He \ngraduated high school in 1982. He has been married since 1984, and has one adult \ndaughter, and two adult step-children. (Item 3) \nApplicant has had several periods of unemployment. He was laid off from his job \nof ten years in December 2017, and was then unemployed until June 2018. He became \nreemployed for about seven months, but left that job in January 2019 because there \nwas not enough work for him, and he had a long commute. He obtained a new job in \nMarch 2019 for about eight months, but lost it due to budget cuts. He was unemployed \nfrom November 2019 to August 2020, before obtaining his current job. He asserts that \nthese periods of unemployment caused him financial distress. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nIn his background interview, Applicant stated that when his bills became \ndelinquent, he worked with his creditors to continue making payments. However, he did \nnot provide specific information about how he worked with his creditors, or \ndocumentation of these efforts. He stated that despite working with them, some \ncreditors sent his accounts to collection. (Item 4) \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant stated that he began paying off creditors as he \ncould. He claimed that he has done very well in satisfying most of his debts, and will \ncontinue to pay them until they are all settled. He did not provide any substantiating \ndocumentation of his payments or resolution of specific debts. With his Response, he \nincluded two screen shots from his phone, purporting to show summaries of collection \naccounts from two credit reporting agencies. They appear to be from a phone app and \nnot from a credit report. The summaries provide no detail other than the creditor name \nand debt amount. (Response; AE A) \nThe Equifax summary Applicant provided with his FORM Response shows that \nhe has three collections totaling $3,937. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.k are listed, as \nwell as one debt for $58 that is not on the SOR. The TransUnion summary shows that \nhe has four collections totaling $6,105.

(Response; AE A) \nThe SOR alleges eleven delinquent debts, totaling approximately $75,000. Five \nof these debts are charged off, five are in collection status, and one is three years\u2019 \ndelinquent. The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the 2020 and \n2021 credit reports. Applicant did not provide documentation to show the current status \nof the SOR debts. (Items 2-6; Response) The status of the debts follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are medical accounts in collection for $202, and $58, \nrespectively. (Items 4, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a debt in collection in the amount of $2,693.

(Items 4, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is an auto loan that was charged off in the amount of $1,172. It was \nopened in 2011 and Applicant\u2019s last payment was in January 2016. He reported that he \nwas unable to keep up payments on the car and surrendered it to the creditor. He stated \nthat he intends to pay this debt. (Items 3-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a mortgage account that is three years\u2019 delinquent in the amount of \n$48,119, with a total balance of $204,959. It was opened in 2012, and last paid in April \n2019. Applicant stated in his background interview that the loan was in forbearance and \nthat he was trying to defer payments until the end of 2020, while his financial situation \nstabilized. Applicant denies this debt in his Answer, but provided no documentation \nshowing the current status of the loan. (Items 4, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a personal loan that was charged off in the amount of $941. It was \nopened in October 2016, and became delinquent in November 2016.

He also submitted no \ndocumentation concerning his current financial situation, such as his monthly income \nand expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence of \ncredit counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts are small and do not appear to be part of the larger \npattern of delinquent consumer debt. The creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.b is not specifically \nidentified in the credit reports, so he is not able to research it. I find the medical debts do \nnot represent a security concern. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should \napply. He did not provide any documentation that any of his debts have been or are \nbeing paid, or otherwise resolved. He provided no documentation of his current financial \nsituation, evidence which might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. \nHis debts are recent, not isolated, and are ongoing and unresolved, indeed, he has \nother, unalleged debts as well. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant is given some consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b). His loss of employment \nstarting in December 2017 and his sporadic subsequent employment, had an impact on \nhis finances. However, the record shows that three of his debts became delinquent in \n2016 before he became unemployed, and one debt became delinquent after he started \nhis current job. There is insufficient evidence to show that he has rehabilitated his \nmortgage, which is three years\u2019 delinquent. The record shows that his debts are largely \nunresolved, and he did not provide sufficient evidence to show that he undertook \nresponsible action to address them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nSimilarly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he has undertaken \ngood-faith efforts to address his debts. The two collections summaries that he provided \nin his Response do not prove that he has paid the debts alleged in the SOR. \nFurthermore, the information he provided shows that there are three new collections \nthat didn\u2019t appear on his 2020 and 2021 credit reports.

AG \n\u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Six of the seven SOR debts were \nreported in collections in August 2020. (Item 5.) In his Personal Subject Interview (PSI), \nhe said that he was unaware that the accounts in question were delinquent. (Item 4.) \n Law and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n  When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes a condition that raises a security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The \nSOR debts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports \nshow that AG \u00b6 19(a) applies (inability to satisfy debts). \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the  \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.   \nThe question is whether mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) applies on these facts.. \nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts went into collections in August 2020. That is not \nvery long ago. Nor were those SOR debts infrequent. And they persist to the present. \nBecause of the frequency and recency of the debts, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate his \ndebts. \nApplicant denied three of the SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) on its face requires \n\u201cdocumented proof\u201d and \u201cevidence.\u201d He did not, however, provide any documented proof \nor evidence supporting his three denials. The Appeals Board has routinely held that it is \nreasonable to expect applicants to produce documentation supporting their efforts to \nresolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant has not \nsatisfied that longstanding requirement. His SOR debts have not been mitigated under \nAG \u00b6 20(e). I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a shipboard mechanic with his current employer since June 2020. He received a General Educational Development (GED) diploma in 2012. He enrolled in one university class, but because he failed to complete the course, he did not receive any credit for it. He enlisted in the Army National Guard (ANG) in February 2012, and remained in the ANG until he was honorably discharged in May 2017. That same month, he transitioned into the U.S. Army, and served on active duty until May 2020, when he was discharged under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC). He was granted a secret clearance in 2012, but it was suspended in 2020. Although he denied ever being married in his SF 86, Applicant was married in Korea to a Russian national in 2018. Foreign Influence Applicant was born in the United States to U.S. citizen-parents in 1992. In approximately February or March 2018, while serving with the U.S. Army in Korea, he started dating a Russian citizen who was working at an off-base Korean bar as a bartender.

The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn an unsworn, undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on \nOctober 13, 2021, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on October 21, 2021. \nAlthough a response to the FORM was due on November 20, 2021, as of December 14, \n2021, Applicant had not responded to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 1, 2022. The record closed on December 14, 2021. \nRulings on Procedure \nDepartment Counsel requested that the administrative judge assigned the case \ntake Administrative Notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to the Russian \nFederation (Russia), appearing in extracts of 14 written submissions, as well as certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to marriage and divorce in the Republic of Korea (Korea) \nissued by the U.S. Embassy & Consulate in Korea. Facts are proper for Administrative \nNotice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant and \nmaterial to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on source information \nregarding Russia in publications of the Department of State; the Department of Justice; \nthe Department of Homeland Security; the Office of the Director of Intelligence, National \nCounterintelligence and Security Center; the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence; the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; and the U.S. \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative \nnotice may utilize authoritative information or sources from the internet.

However, while I do not reject the facts set forth in the four press releases \nissued by the U.S. Department of Justice, any inference that Applicant or his family \nparticipated in criminal activity was not argued by the Government and is specifically \nrejected. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, all of the \nfactual allegations in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated \nherein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a shipboard mechanic with his current employer since June 2020. He \nreceived a General Educational Development (GED) diploma in 2012. He enrolled in \none university class, but because he failed to complete the course, he did not receive \nany credit for it. He enlisted in the Army National Guard (ANG) in February 2012, and \nremained in the ANG until he was honorably discharged in May 2017. That same \nmonth, he transitioned into the U.S. Army, and served on active duty until May 2020, \nwhen he was discharged under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC). He was \ngranted a secret clearance in 2012, but it was suspended in 2020. Although he denied \never being married in his SF 86, Applicant was married in Korea to a Russian national in \n2018. \nForeign Influence \nApplicant was born in the United States to U.S. citizen-parents in 1992. In \napproximately February or March 2018, while serving with the U.S. Army in Korea, he \nstarted dating a Russian citizen who was working at an off-base Korean bar as a \nbartender. He purchased her an engagement ring for about $7,000. In February 2019, \nthey were married under Korean law, but he did not register the marriage with U.S. \nauthorities. In September 2019, they unofficially, but not legally, separated. He believes \nshe now resides in Russia, but he does not know exactly where. He reportedly has not \nhad any contact with her since their separation. (Item 4 at 8, 11, 16, 22-25, 31, 34, 39-\n40, 45-46, 48, 51; and Item 10 at 4)  \nAlthough Applicant previously indicated that he intended to seek an annulment \nonce he obtained a new job, he subsequently changed his mind, claiming that after he \nconsulted with unidentified attorneys after he left military service, and they purportedly \nadvised him that he was never legally married in Korea because it was never registered \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith U.S. authorities, he decided that the marriage had never happened, so a divorce \nwas unnecessary. (Item 4 at 16; and Item 2) \nApplicant contends that because his marriage in Korea was not registered with \nU.S. authorities, the marriage was not legal and did not have to be reported in his SF 86 \nor to investigators from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who \ninterviewed him. As noted by the U.S. Embassy in Korea: \nMarriages in Korea are not reported to the United States since the U.S. \ndoes not have a central marriage registry, and the U.S. Embassy does not \nkeep a record of marriages performed in Korea. In general, marriages \nthat are legally performed and valid abroad are also legally valid in \nthe United States. Although marriage statutes in the U.S. differ from state \nto state, a marriage performed in Korea under the Korean law is \nrecognized in all states. (emphasis added) \n(Request for Administrative Notice 2 \u2013 Marriage /Divorce) \nBased on the law of Korea as presented, and Applicant\u2019s failure to submit any \nlegal documentation from the unidentified lawyers that he cites to support his \ncontentions, I conclude that Applicant was legally married under Korean law, and that \nmarriage is still valid in the United States. \nRussia \nRussia is composed of a number of republics. On March 18, 2014, Russia \nannexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine after an unrecognized referendum, and it \nsubsequently became the Republic of Crimea, the 22nd republic of Russia. However, \nUkraine and most of the international community do not recognize Crimea's \nannexation and the United Nations (UN) General Assembly declared the vote to be \nillegitimate. \nThe Government consists of a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral \nlegislature, and a weak judiciary often subject to political manipulation. In short, it has a \nhighly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by President Vladimir Putin. \nIt is a vast and diverse country with a population of over 146 million people. It achieved \nindependence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991, and remains \na nuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially, and economically. \nOn paper, Russia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights \nstandards, but it continues to be a \u201cpolice state\u201d where human rights abuses are \nrampant. There are numerous reports of human rights abuses, including law \nenforcement personnel engaged in torture, abuse, and violence to coerce confessions \nfrom suspects, with little accountability, despite the fact that the law prohibits such \npractices; widespread corruption within the police force; arbitrary arrest and detention; \npolitically motivated arrests; abductions; and life threatening prison conditions. The \nmedia is largely state-controlled. There are restrictions on freedom of movement within \nthe country, and all adults must carry government-issued internal passports while \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntraveling internally, and they are required to register with the local authorities within a \nspecified time of their arrival at a new location. \nRussia\u2019s two main intelligence services are the Russian Foreign Intelligence \nService (SVR) and the main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), both \noverseen by the Russian National Security Council and coordinated through the \nPermanent Interbranch Commissions of the National Security. Its intelligence capability \nis significant and focuses on collection of information from the United States. The Soviet \nUnion engaged in a series of high profile espionage missions against the United States, \nand Russia has continued the tradition. Russia is one of the three most capable and \nactive cyber actors tied to the aggressive collection of sensitive and protected U.S. \ntrade secrets and proprietary information. Russia also provides technologies which \ncould be used in the construction of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other \ncountries. It is a leading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and \nmilitary-related technology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela. \nOn July 26, 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center released \nits 2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace Report, in which it reported that \nforeign economic and industrial espionage against the United States continues to \nrepresent a significant threat to the United States\u2019 prosperity, security, and competitive \nadvantage and identified Russia as one of the three most capable and active cyber \nactors tied to economic espionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and \nproprietary information. It reported that Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument \nof intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its economic interests, \nand that Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and large-scale \nhacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information. \nThe report noted that, \u201c[a]n aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. \ntechnologies, Russia uses cyberspace as one of many methods for obtaining the \nnecessary know-how and technology to grown and modernize its economy.\u201d Other \nmethods of collection include use of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that \ninteract with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills \nby the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and \nprivate enterprises, which enable the Russian government to obtain sensitive technical \ninformation from industry. \nIn February 2018, and again in April 2021, the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (ODNI) issued its Worldwide Threat Assessments of the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity, Statement for the Record, in which it assessed that Russia will employ a \nvariety of aggressive tactics to bolster its standing as a great power, weaken the United \nStates, and undermine Euro-Atlantic unity; and that Russia will use a range of relatively \nlow-cost tools to advance its foreign policy objectives, including influence campaigns, \neconomic coercion, cyber operations, and measured military force. The ODNI also \nassessed that President Putin will likely increase his use of repression and intimidation \nto contend with domestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a \nsluggish economy; he will continue to manipulate the media and is likely to expand the \nRussian government\u2019s legal basis for repression; and Russia will continue to modernize, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndevelop, and field a wide range of advanced nuclear, conventional, and asymmetric \ncapabilities to balance its perception of a strategic military inferiority vis-a-vis the United \nStates. Russia will also seek to maintain, and where possible, expand its influence \nthrough the former Soviet countries that it asserts are in its self-described sphere of \ninfluence. \nThe U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for Russia is Level 4 \u2013 Do Not \nTravel, due to terrorism, harassment by Russian government security officials, the \narbitrary enforcement of local laws, and the embassy\u2019s limited ability to assist U.S. \ncitizens in Russia. The advisory directs U.S. citizens not to travel to the North \nCaucasus, including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism, kidnapping, and risk \nof civil unrest; or to Crimea due to Russia\u2019s occupation of the Ukrainian territory and \nabuses by its occupying authorities. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks \nin Russia, and may attack with little or no warning. U.S. citizens have been arbitrarily \ninterrogated or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, \nmistreatment, and extortion. Due to the Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. \ndiplomatic personnel in Russia, the U.S. Government has reduced ability to provide \nservices to U.S. citizens. \nThe Department of State has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location \nfor terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Although \nRussia continued to prioritize counterterrorism efforts in 2017, it remained a target of \ninternational terrorist groups, particularly ISIS. \nRussia has attempted to reassert its dominance in, and integration of, the former \nSoviet states and has generally been successful with Belarus and Armenia. It has \nremained unwelcomingly active in the internal affairs of several of its neighboring \ncountries\u2014former republics of the Soviet Union or occupied \u201cindependent countries\u201d\u2014 \nsuch as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, and has issued threats against \nPoland (a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1999), the \nCzech Republic (a member of NATO since 1999), and Estonia (a member of NATO \nsince 2004). Russia maintains an extensive military presence in Crimea. \nThe international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not \nrecognize Russia\u2019s purported annexation of Crimea. In response to Russia\u2019s violations \nof Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, and other acts, the United States suspended most bilateral \nengagement with the Russian government on economic issues. Anti-American and anti-\nWestern rhetoric is widespread in both official media sources and on social media. On \nFebruary 24, 2022 Russia again invaded Ukraine and took large swaths of southern and \neastern Ukraine. As early as March 2022, leaders in the unrecognized Luhansk \nPeople's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic both expressed their wish to join \nRussia, originally once Russia captured all their claimed territory. However, after \nsudden Ukrainian gains in the east in September 2022, Russia and the unrecognized \nrepublics hastily rushed a series of referendums on annexation to Russia. The \nreferendum results claimed an overwhelming majority supported annexation. On \nSeptember 30, 2022, Putin formally announced the annexation of the two \nrepublics. However, the referendums were condemned internationally as a sham while \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe European Union and G7 rejected them as illegal. The UN Secretary General \ncondemned the annexations as a violation of the UN Charter. \nRussia specifically targeted non-military areas of Ukraine with its bombing and \nmissile attacks on civilian-populated areas, including hospitals and schools. When \nUkraine\u2019s forces liberated several sections of its territory from Russian occupation in \nSeptember 2022, it was discovered that significant war crimes were committed by \nRussian troops against innocent civilians and prisoners of war. Despite world-wide \ncondemnation, President Putin has threatened to utilize tactical nuclear weapons in \nUkraine if the war in Ukraine should prove to be unwinnable. Such actions and threats \nby the Russians have been universally condemned. \nIn its 2020 Human Rights Report, the Department of State reported that Russia\u2019s \noccupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula continued to \naffect the human rights situation in Russia significantly and negatively. Credible \nobservers attributed thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as widespread \nabuses, to Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region and to Russian occupation \nauthorities in Crimea. Human rights groups asserted that numerous Ukrainian citizens \nremained in Russia as political prisoners. \nThe most significant human rights issues in Russia included extrajudicial killings; \nenforced disappearance; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in death \nand sometimes included punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial independence; \npolitical prisoners; severe interference with privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and the media; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of association, \nincluding laws on \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cundesirable foreign organizations;\u201d and \nwidespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government. The government \nfailed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed \nabuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \nCybercrime is also a significant problem across Russia. The risk of infection, \ncompromise, and theft via malware, spam email, sophisticated spear phishing, and \nsocial engineering attacks is significant. Telephone and electronic communications are \nsubject to surveillance at any time without advisory. The Russian System for \nOperational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that \ntraverses Russia\u2019s networks. \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nApplicant began experimenting with alcohol, initially beer, by himself when he \nwas about 15-years old, but he did not like the taste. Around four years later, because \nhe had older friends, he generally consumed alcohol in social settings. When he arrived \nin Korea in May 2017, he was consuming one to two beers per day. However, because \nhe claimed that he was not a regular drinker, he did not know his limits. His subsequent \nconsumption of alcohol was, by his own admission, excessive enough to have had an \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadverse impact on his work or result in intervention by law enforcement authorities. \n(Item 4 at 23) \nIn June 2016, after attending a ANG function and consuming alcohol to the point \nof intoxication, while driving he was stopped by the police. He was administered a field \nsobriety test and a breathalyzer, and he failed both tests. He was arrested and charged \nwith driving while intoxicated (DWI) and open alcoholic beverage container (there was \nan open beer in a cup holder) during operation of a motor vehicle. He subsequently pled \nguilty to both offenses and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, placed on probation for 180 \ndays, ordered to perform community service, and fined about $2,000. (Item 2; Item 3 at \n31-32; Item 4 at 15-16, 23; and Item 6 at 13) \nOn January 1, 2018, at about 4:00 a.m., Applicant was stopped at the main gate \nof his military installation for a curfew violation. A curfew had previously been ordered \nthat required all military personnel to be on post by 1:00 a.m., and in their room by 2:00 \na.m. However, Applicant and a girlfriend remained off post in a hotel room where he had \nconsumed alcohol. He was administered a breathalyzer test which yielded a result of \n.048 percent blood alcohol content (BAC). He was issued a Field Grade Article 15 under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) by the battalion commander for violation of \nthe curfew; failure to obey a general order concerning alcohol consumption; missing a \nrecall formation; and making a false statement to the military police. He was given 45 \ndays of extra duty; reduced in rank from E-4 to E-1 (suspended); and forfeiture of pay \n(suspended). He was also referred to the Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care \n(SUDCC) program under AR 600-85, The Army Substance Abuse Program (November \n26, 2016). (Item 2; Item 4 at 15, 20; and Item 7) \nApplicant\u2019s participation in SUDCC commenced in January 2018, and he was \nrequired to attend group counseling sessions two times per week and a one-on-one \ncounseling session one time per week. In addition, there was to be zero tolerance for \nalcohol. (Item 4 at 20) He was transferred to a different unit within his command in early \nMarch 2018. On March 13, 2018, he missed a unit formation with his new unit, and \nwhen found in his room, he admitted to consuming alcohol. (Item 2; Item 4 at 20) He \nwas deemed a SUDCC failure because of his continuing consumption of alcohol while \nin the program. As a result of that continued alcohol consumption, Applicant was \ncommand-referred to treatment at the Addictions Medicine Intensive Outpatient \nProgram (AMIOP) on March 27, 2018. He successfully completed the five-week \nprogram, consisting of group and individual counseling eight hours per day, five days \nper week, on May 1, 2018. His enrollment in SUDCC was extended until March 2019, \ndue to being a SUDCC failure. (Item 2; Item 4 at 20-21, 24) \nOn August 4, 2019, after consuming between 5 and 10 cocktails over a four-hour \nperiod at a restaurant with a friend, Applicant drove himself back to base, and he was \napprehended by military police during a 100 percent ID card check at the entry to the \nmilitary facility. Several open containers were observed in plain view in his vehicle. He \nfailed the field sobriety tests and refused to submit to a breath sample. Nevertheless, he \nwas transported to the medical center for a mandatory blood test authorized by his unit \ncommander. The test registered .213 percent BAC.

(Item 2; Item 4 at 5-6, 8; Item 8) \nIn November 2019, Applicant underwent a command-referred psychological \nevaluation at the medical center\u2019s behavioral health clinic. During the evaluation by a \nlicensed clinical psychologist, Applicant denied needing treatment for his alcohol use; \ndenied current use; denied any further alcohol-related incidents; denied failing to \nsuccessfully complete any recommended alcohol treatment program; denied resuming \nalcohol consumption after completion of an alcohol treatment program; denied ever \nengaging in binge drinking; and denied ever arriving to duty under the influence or with \na hangover. (Item 5 at 2-3) The psychologist noted that in the past year, Applicant \nacknowledged being intoxicated about 200 times as of March 25, 2019. The \npsychologist also referred to the SUDCC records that indicated a diagnosis under the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th  Edition) (DSM-IV) of Alcohol \nDependence, Uncomplicated. That type of diagnosis is now referred to in the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) (DSM-V) as Alcohol Use \nDisorder. The prognosis was fair to good. (Item 5 at 3) \nIn April 2020, an Army separation board met. In accordance with the board\u2019s \nfindings, on May 7, 2020, Applicant was administratively separated from the Army for \nmisconduct and issued the UOTHC discharge. (Item 2; Item 4 at 6) \nAs of May 5, 2021, Applicant acknowledged currently drinking alcoholic \nbeverages such as beer, wine and liquor. He admitted consuming two to three 12-ounce \nbeers per month. He denied drinking to intoxication which he claimed occurred when he \nhad six or more drinks in an hour. He contended that his last intoxication occurred on \nAugust 4, 2019. He has not received any alcohol counseling or treatment since his \nseparation from the Army, and is not participating in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He \nintends to continue consuming alcohol. (Item 4 at 51-55) \nPersonal Conduct \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86 on July 9, 2020, in Section 17 \u2013 \nMarital/Relationship Status, in response to the instruction to provide his current \nmarital/relationship status with regard to civil marriage, legally recognized civil union, or \nlegally recognized domestic partnership, he responded \u201cNever entered into a civil \nmarriage, legally recognized civil union, or legally recognized domestic partnership.\u201d \n(Item 3 at 22) That response was untrue, for as noted above, in February 2019, he had \nactually married a Russian national under Korean law. In September 2019, they \nunofficially, but not legally, separated. Marriages that are legally performed and valid \nabroad are also legally valid in the United States. Since no annulment or divorce took \nplace, Applicant should have candidly reported that he was married. He subsequently \nclaimed that he misunderstood or overlooked the question.

(Item 4 at 8) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1)) \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  \nCir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n(See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Id.) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)) \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)) Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his Russian wife is a current concern for the Government. However, \nthe security significance of these identified concerns requires further examination of his \nrelationship with that family member who is currently a Russian citizen-resident to \ndetermine the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors, including \nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the realistic potential \nfor exploitation.

Mar. 13, \n2017)) Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Russia with the United States, and the situation in Russia place a burden \nof persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with any family member \nliving in Russia does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to assist a relative living in Russia. \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Russia seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his wife, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility \nin the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Russia has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s wife in Russia \u201ccould be a means through which \nApplicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and \nwho would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d (ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd.

This relationship creates a potential heightened risk \nof foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. While Applicant now \ncontends the relationship no longer exists, and has previously even denied the \nexistence of the relationship, the fact that he has repeatedly denied that there was such \na relationship, is troubling. He may deny that they are currently bound by any affection \ninfluence, common interests, and/or obligation, but the accuracy of that denial is \nquestionable in light of his other examples of a lack of candor, as well as his purchase \nof an expensive engagement ring for her. In addition, although Applicant denied that his \nwife was associated with the Russian government, military, or intelligence services, in \nreality, he does not know if she is, and was unable to even spell her name. \nNevertheless, because Applicant is now in the United States and his wife is in Russia, \nand they no longer communicate or have a relationship other than by marriage, the \ndegree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest is dramatically reduced. AG \u00b6 \n7(c) has been established, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nThere is the presence of terrorist groups; increased levels of terrorism, violence, \nand insurgency; and human rights problems in Russia that demonstrate that a \nheightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present due to Applicant\u2019s ties to \nhis wife. However, that risk is not generated solely by the Russian government, but also \nby terrorists striking out against the central Russian authorities and all foreigners. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a potential target in this war on civilized humanity.

However, as noted above, based on their relationship, there is a potential, but \ngreatly reduced, risk \u2013 a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security \nclearance.  \nUnder the developed evidence, because their relationship is so casual and \ninfrequent it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States. I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United \nStates is steadfast and undivided, and that he has \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d However, because Applicant has routinely denied \nthe relationship existed and repeatedly failed to report it, he has failed to comply with \nexisting agency requirements regarding the reporting of the relationship.

In January 2018, he appeared late at the military facility \ngate with a BAC of .048, after which he was disciplined under Article 15, UCMJ, for a \nvariety of charges including violation of the curfew; failure to obey a general order \nconcerning alcohol consumption; and missing a recall formation. Applicant\u2019s \nparticipation in SUDCC commenced in January 2018, and there was to be zero \ntolerance for alcohol. However, in March 2018, he missed a unit formation with his new \nunit, and when found in his room, he admitted to consuming alcohol. He was deemed a \nSUDCC failure because of his continuing consumption of alcohol while in the program. \nAs a result of that continued alcohol consumption, he was command-referred to \ntreatment at the AMIOP in March 2018. He successfully completed the five-week \nprogram in May 2018. His enrollment in SUDCC was extended until March 2019, due to \nbeing a SUDCC failure. \nSUDCC records indicated a diagnosis under DSM-IV of Alcohol Dependence, \nUncomplicated. That type of diagnosis is now referred to in DSM-V as Alcohol Use \nDisorder. The prognosis was fair to good. \nIn August 2019, after consuming between 5 and 10 cocktails over a four-hour \nperiod at a restaurant, he was apprehended by military police at the entry to the military \nfacility. Several open containers were observed in plain view in his vehicle. He failed the \nfield sobriety tests and refused to submit to a breath sample. Nevertheless, he \nunderwent a mandatory blood test authorized by his unit commander. The test \nregistered .213 percent BAC. He was charged with DUI without personal injury, in \nviolation of Article 113, UCMJ. He was issued a Field Grade Article 15. \nIn November 2019, Applicant underwent a command-referred psychological \nevaluation at the medical center\u2019s behavioral health clinic. During the evaluation by a \nlicensed clinical psychologist, Applicant denied needing treatment for his alcohol use; \ndenied current use; denied any further alcohol-related incidents; denied failing to \nsuccessfully complete any recommended alcohol treatment program; denied resuming \nalcohol consumption after completion of an alcohol treatment program; denied ever \nengaging in binge drinking; and denied ever arriving to duty under the influence or with \na hangover. The psychologist noted that in the past year, as of March 2019, Applicant \nacknowledged being intoxicated about 200 times.  \n16 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAs of May 2021, Applicant admitted consuming two to three 12-ounce beers per \nmonth.

He has not received any alcohol counseling or treatment since his separation \nfrom the Army, and is not participating in AA. He intends to continue consuming alcohol. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), 25(d), 25(e), and 25(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Alcohol Consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has not been candid regarding \nhis alcohol consumption history, and his stories keep changing. While he has \nacknowledged some degrees of maladaptive alcohol use, he has failed to provide any \nevidence of positive actions, other than his reported successful completion of AMIOP, \ntaken to overcome his alcohol problems. Aside from his unverified claim that he has \nbeen sober (not intoxicated or impaired) since August 2019, he failed to demonstrate \nany pattern of altered alcohol consumption, much less a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nHis maladaptive use of alcohol, and his continuing consumption of alcohol, as well as \nhis lack of candor, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \n17 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \nuntrustworthiness; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been established. My discussions related to \nApplicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption are adopted herein. His 2016 conviction; 2018 Article \n15, UCMJ, discipline; and 2019 Article 15, UCMJ, discipline, combined establish a \npattern of criminal offenses that, in part, led to his administrative separation from the \nU.S. Army in May 2020, when he was issued a UOTHC discharge.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither condition applies. Despite repeated punishment and discipline received \nfor his conduct, Applicant continued his criminal path unhindered by rules, regulations, \nor laws. While the most recent reported incident of criminal conduct took place in \nAugust 2019, given Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, his acknowledgment that he was \nintoxicated about 200 times during the year ending in March 2019, and his unverified \nposition regarding his more recent alcohol consumption habits, it remains likely that \nsuch criminal conduct will recur. He failed to furnish evidence of successful \nrehabilitation, a good employment record, or constructive community involvement. His \ncriminal conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \n18 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns for Personal Conduct under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nAs noted above, Applicant was not candid when he completed his SF 86 in July \n2020, and lied about his February 2019 marriage to a Russian national by claiming to \nnever having been married; and also lied about being bound by affection influence, and \ncommon interests within the last seven years, when in fact, he purchased an expensive \nengagement ring and was dating and subsequently married the Russian national. In \nOctober 2020, during his OPM interview, he again lied by denying being bound by \n19 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \naffection influence, and common interests, when he was still married. In his defense, \nApplicant claimed to have conferred with unidentified attorneys who advised him that his \nmarriage in Korea was not legal because he had not registered it with U.S. authorities. \nHe failed to submit any documents to support his contention, or to rebut the evidence \nprovided by the Government addressing the issue of foreign marriages in Korea. Based \non the entire record, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) have been established \npertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a. through 4.c. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Personal Conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant eventually told the truth about \nhis marriage, but it took confrontations before he did so. He still denies that there was \nany affection with his wife. While the relationship between them may have changed \nsince he returned to the United States and she returned to Russia, he continues to deny \nany such affection between them during the seven years prior to 2020. Applicant\u2019s \nperceived lack of candor continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n20 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006).) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant is a 30-year\u00ad\nold employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as shipboard mechanic with \nhis current employer since June 2020. He received a GED diploma in 2012. He enlisted \nin the ANG in February 2012, and remained in the ANG until he was honorably \ndischarged in May 2017. That same month, he transitioned into the U.S. Army, and \nserved on active duty until May 2020. He was granted a secret clearance in 2012. \nAlthough he is still legally married to a Russian national, she resides in Russia and he \nresides in the U.S., and they have not maintained any continuing correspondence since \nlate 2019. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. He was not candid when he falsified his responses to questions in his SF 86 \nin 2020, and during interviews with an OPM investigator. Although he denied ever being \nmarried in his SF 86, Applicant was married in Korea to a Russian national in 2018. He \nhas a history of maladaptive alcohol consumption that resulted in arrests and discipline \nfor alcohol-related incidents, and alcohol-treatment program failure. A clinical \npsychologist noted that in one year ending in March 2019, Applicant acknowledged \nbeing intoxicated about 200 times. His diagnosis under DSM-IV was Alcohol \nDependence, Uncomplicated. That type of diagnosis is now referred to in DSM-V as \nAlcohol Use Disorder. The prognosis was fair to good. He was administratively \ndischarged from the Army under other than honorable conditions. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 2012, but it was suspended in 2020. Because of continuing \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, I have substantial questions about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See \nAG \u00b6 2(a)(1) through AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, while \nI conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from the foreign \ninfluence, I also conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nthe alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n21 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a. through 4.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent Federal tax debt and unfiled 2016, \n2017, 2018, and 2019 Federal and State A income tax returns establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He \nattributed his failure to pay and file Federal and state income tax returns for multiple years \ndue to it not being a priority and procrastination. He has failed to provide supporting \ndocumentation to demonstrate his good-faith efforts to remedy this matter. There is \ninsufficient information to determine the amount of additional Federal or state tax debt he \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay owe, if any.

A person who fails to address concerns, even after \nhaving been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is in jeopardy, \nmay lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare at stake. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career as a Defense contractor and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I conclude \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 12, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 4, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n27, 2021, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 17, 2021. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1-3, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant \ntestified and offered exhibits (AE) A-B, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 29, 2021. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. I have \nincorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He has never married, but is currently engaged. He has \na bachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked for a defense contractor since February 2021. \nFrom January 2020 to February 2021, he also worked for a defense contractor. He has \nnever held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application (SCA) \nin January 2020. (Tr. 6, 17; GE 1)   \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: used and purchased marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from August 2011 to October 2019; was arrested and charged with \npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in January 2012; and was arrested for \ndriving under the influence of and possession of marijuana in August 2013. (See SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c.) \n \n \n \nApplicant began using marijuana shortly after graduating from high school. He \ncontinued to use it sporadically throughout college. He acknowledged that he made \n\u201cbad decisions\u201d in that regard. He was arrested in January 2012 for using marijuana in \nhis dorm room when a resident advisor reported it. In August 2013, he was driving after \nhaving used marijuana and was stopped by law enforcement for speeding. He was \nsuspected of driving under the influence of marijuana and arrested. His use of \nmarijuana was confirmed by a blood test. He pleaded guilty to a reckless driving charge \nand satisfied all the terms of his sentence without incident. (Tr. 19-22, 27) \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that his last use of marijuana was in 2017. He stated \nthat the reference in his March 2020 statement to a background investigator that his last \nuse was in 2019 was a mistake. He has dissociated from his college friends with whom \nhe used marijuana. He has no intentions of using marijuana in the future. He reported \nhis marijuana use on his SCA and during his background investigation. (Tr. 22, 24-25; \nGE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant presented a letter from his work supervisor. His supervisor recognized \nApplicant as a trustworthy employee and highly dependable. (AE B) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana at various times between 2011 and \n2017. He was also charged with using marijuana in his dorm room and while driving. I \nfind AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use while in college was sporadic, but it ceased in 2017. \nHe has credibly expressed his intent not to use it in the future. He no longer associates \nwith the friends with whom he was using marijuana. He acknowledged that his youthful \nuse of marijuana was foolish and irresponsible. He has established an excellent \nreputation at work where he is a valued and trusted employee. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. His \nnearly four years of abstinence, commitment to abstinence, and his distancing from his \ndrug-associated friends are sufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s intent not to use in the \nfuture. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and circumstances of the conduct; (2)the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s \nstatement. I also considered Applicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use drugs in the \nfuture. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 24) Approximately \ntwo years ago, he withdrew all of his money from this pension because he no longer \nwished to have any contact with the Turkish government. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant has not traveled to Turkey since 2016. Per a coworker, Applicant has \nthoroughly immersed himself in U.S. culture and values since immigrating here. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant feels closer to the United States than he does to Turkey. (AE A at 3) \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with an executive presidential system and a \nunicameral parliament. (HE I at 1) Turkey is a key ally of the United States, a critical \nregional partner, and an active participant in fighting terrorism. It has actively cooperated \nwith the United States in providing airspace access for operations in Iraq and Syria, and it \nhas actively tracked down and deported people attempting to join terrorist organizations, \nand deported them to their home countries. Conversely, Turkey has used anti-terrorism as \na pretext for repressing its citizens and muzzling political expression. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nUnder this concern, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Moreover, foreign interests and security concerns \u201cmay also \nbe a national security concern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization of government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion \nby any foreign interest.\u201d (Id.) \nTurkey is a staunch U.S. ally that is actively involved in fighting terrorism and in \npromoting U.S. regional interests, Conversely, Turkey has a poor human rights record, and \nits government has become increasingly authoritarian over the past few years. These facts, \ncombined with Applicant\u2019s significant rank in the Turkish military before retiring could attract \nundue attention to his family members and generate a vulnerability to coercion, influence \nor duress. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of, or resident in a foreign county if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies. \nIn addition to AG \u00b6 7(a) security concerns, Applicant\u2019s friends who are former \nmembers of the Turkish military generate concerns under AG \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s remaining financial interests in Turkey are nominal in comparison to his \nfinancial interests in the United States. Consequently, AG \u00b6 7(f) \u201csubstantial business, \nfinancial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign owned or foreign-\noperated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence, or exploitation or personal conflict of interest,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his old friends from the Turkish military are limited to the \nexchange of online jokes. As such, these contacts are mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation.\u201d Although Applicant\u2019s contact \nwith his brother and sister are also infrequent, there is a presumption that one has ties of \naffection or obligation to one\u2019s immediate family members and parents-in-law. (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03120 at 4 (Feb. 20, 2002) Consequently, AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his siblings. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s communication with his father is limited because of his father\u2019s \ndementia, he has genuine affection for him because he still makes efforts to see him \nthrough a social media app even though his father can no longer talk to him. Moreover, \nalthough Applicant\u2019s communication with his mother-in-law is infrequent, he provides \nfinancial support for her. Consequently, AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith his father and his mother-in-law. \nApplicant spent the last seven years of his Turkish military career stationed in the \nUnited States, working with his U.S. counterparts and attending graduate school. During \nthis period, he performed admirably in support of U.S. interests, earning a Meritorious \nService Award from the U.S. branch of the military that he was serving. Moreover, nearly \nall of his financial interests are in the United States, and he has been working for his U.S. \nemployer for seven years. Under these circumstances, the security concerns generated by \nApplicant\u2019s family members in Turkey are mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of \ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \nor allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual\u2019 has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual \ncan be expected resolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the foreign interest security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, particularly with respect to my analysis of Applicant\u2019s meritorious \nservice in support of the U.S. military while in the Turkish military, and his integration into \nU.S. society since immigrating to the United States and becoming a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 25, 31) \nApplicant explained that FB was his first job after leaving active duty and he soon \nbecame frustrated with the company and the manner in which his supervisor treated \nemployees. During his last work week at FB, (he had secured another position), he \ndecided to access his supervisor\u2019s emails and review them for disparaging information \nabout his co-workers. (Tr. 25, 28-29, 60) After locating some emails with pejorative \nstatements, Applicant copied two excerpts and sent them in emails to his supervisor and \nthe chief executive officer (CEO) on his last work day. In his email Applicant commented \non their inappropriate conduct involving employees. (Tr. 32, 45-46) Applicant said this \nwas the only time he accessed his supervisor\u2019s email (Tr. 27, 32) He has never accessed \nanyone else\u2019s email since this incident. (Tr. 34, 39, 47) \nIn retrospect, Applicant admitted that his behavior was impulsive and \nunprofessional. He acknowledged that he was upset with the FB\u2019s treatment of \nemployees. He agreed that he should have handled his concerns differently, such as by \ntalking to his supervisor instead of accessing his email. (Tr. 62, 67) \nAfter leaving FB in April 2017, Applicant started working for civilian IT company \nHC. In June 2017, he was fired for accessing a company\u2019s application without having \nproper credentials while he was on a 90-day probation. Applicant explained that his \nsupervisor assigned him a task for which he needed access to a specific system in order \nto perform the work. Thinking that she wanted the work completed, he asked his co-\nworker for the organization\u2019s login credentials. He did not ask for the co-worker\u2019s personal \ninformation. He said his co-worker provided the company\u2019s login and he then completed \nthe task and logged out. The following day, another supervisor discovered his actions and \nfired him.

(Tr. 14) \nOn April 27, 2021, the CEO for FB signed an affidavit regarding Applicant\u2019s \ntermination with FB in August 2016. In it, the CEO stated Applicant disseminated \ninformation to employees about management activities, meetings, salary, and \nperformance information. (AE 3) Applicant denied that allegation and said he never saw \nthat information and did not have access to it.

He has never accessed another person\u2019s email, used a logon password \nthat was not his, or been disciplined for wrongdoing. He said he has received excellent \nreviews at K. (Tr. 56-58). He told all of the people who submitted character references \nabout his past conduct, as well as his wife. (Tr. 63-64) He admitted that he held a position \nof trust at FB and violated it by accessing his supervisor\u2019s email. (Tr. 66) \nApplicant submitted nine letters attesting to his excellent job performance and \nstrong moral character. One of the letters is from a soldier with whom he served. The \nother eight letters are from colleagues with whom he has worked since early 2019. He is \npraised for his trustworthiness, work ethic, and judgment. (AE D through AE L) The \ncontracting officer for the project Applicant works on wrote that she has known him since \nJanuary 2019. She stated he is a critical part of her team and he supervises 11 \nemployees.\u201d (AE D) She said he is \u201cexceptionally trustworthy.\u201d (Id.)

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for use of information technology \nare set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 40. \nThe following three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nApplicant admitted that he accessed his supervisor\u2019s company e-mail, one time, in \nApril 2017, while working at company FB. He admitted that he used another employee\u2019s \ncredentials at company HC to gain access to a program that he was unauthorized to use \nbecause he was on probation in June 2017. He was terminated from both companies as \na consequence of his actions. The evidence raised disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n40(a), 40(c) and 40(e) as to SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant denied that while he worked at company FB, he accessed specific types \nof company information from his supervisor\u2019s email and forwarded it to employees, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. No documents were produced verifying the CEO\u2019s assertion, which \nis the basis for the allegation. There is insufficient evidence to establish a disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 40 as to that SOR allegation. SOR \u00b6 1.b is found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nConditions that could mitigate the above use of information technology security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nOver the past five years, Applicant has not been warned or disciplined for misusing \nhis position or accessing his employer\u2019s information technology. More importantly, he \nacknowledges his wrongdoing and takes responsibility for it. Similar incidents are unlikely \nto recur given Applicant\u2019s appreciation of the consequences he encountered after being \nfired from two positions, which have subsequently jeopardized his security clearance. \nEight current colleagues, who have known him since early 2019 and one prior to that \ndate, attest to his over-all trustworthiness, reliability, and diligence in complying with IT \nrules. The evidence establishes mitigation for the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                     \n                                \n \n                 \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline M in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered the following facts: \nApplicant\u2019s military service, his remorse over his misconduct in 2017, the absence of \nsubsequent incidents, his favorable character evidence from current colleagues, and his \nstatement that he told those colleagues about his misconduct, as well as his wife. His \ndisclosures to those people diminish the potential for coercion or exploitation and the \nlikelihood of recurrence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant mitigated the use \nof information technology security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \n6 \n Subparagraph 1.b: \n     Subparagraph 1.c:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He served on active duty in the U.S. Air \nForce from December 2000 until his honorable discharge in December 2006. Thereafter, \nApplicant served in the Air Force Active Reserve from January 2007 until November 2011 \nwhen he was honorably discharged. Applicant is a college graduate and is currently \nsponsored by his employer, a defense contractor. (Item 3.) \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent accounts totaling $59,416. (Item 1.) Applicant \nadmitted those allegations and submitted documents showing that four of those accounts \nhad been settled. More specifically, Applicant submitted four letters from the creditors of \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1b. through 1.e. stating that those debts had been settled. (Item 2.) In his \nResponse to the FORM, Applicant submitted a letter from the creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nstating that this debt had been settled. (Response.) Each settlement letter is on the \ncreditor\u2019s letterhead and recites the account number. Those account numbers correspond \nto the account numbers (or the last four digits) on the SOR. Three of the settlement letters \nare dated November 11, 2021, one dated November 13, 2021, and one dated November \n16, 2021. (Item 2 and Response.) Four of the five SOR accounts were disclosed on \nApplicant\u2019s May 2020 SCA. The SOR debts were in default as reported on the September \n3, 2020 credit report. By the December 20, 2021 credit report, those debts showed no \npast due balances. (Items 4 and 5.) (The Government observes that the settlement letters \ndo not recite the amounts or the dates the payments were received. It is difficult to imagine \nthat the creditors did not receive the settlement funds before issuing otherwise authentic \nsettlement letters.) \nApplicant began working for a defense contractor in August 2008, when he was \nliving in the United States. In September 2012, his employer transferred Applicant to a \ncountry in the Middle East (Country A). He was living in Country A when he completed \nhis SCA in May 2020. The SOR was issued in April 2021. Because Applicant used a \nstateside address in the U.S. (his in-laws) for delivery of regular USPS mail, he did not \nreceive the SOR via mail. Instead, after inquiry, Applicant was told by DOHA to expect an \n\u201cEYES ONLY\u201d package (the SOR) via email. (Response.) \nOn October 7, 2021, Applicant emailed DOHA that he still had not received the \nSOR. By that time, he had already been transferred (in 2020) to an Eastern European \ncountry (Country B). On October 8, 2021, Applicant received the SOR.

After being given an extension to answer the SOR by December 12, 2021, \nApplicant answered on November 26, 2021. (Response.) \nAs noted, Applicant was transferred by his employer to Country A in September \n2012. His wife followed in May 2013. At the time, Applicant owned two homes in the \nUnited States, one his primary residence, and one he rented out. He and his wife \ndepended on having both of their incomes to pay household expenses. Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas unable to find full-time employment until February 2014. Because of their jobs, \nApplicant rented a home in a desolate area that was midway between their jobs. The \nlocation of their home made it very affordable. (Response.) \nApplicant and his wife were married in a civil union in April 2009. Now they planned \na more formal wedding in the United States for April 2014. Since both were employed, \nthey believed they could pay off the wedding expenses quickly. Not long after the \nwedding, however, Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job. She was unemployed until May 2016. \nDuring his wife\u2019s unemployment, Applicant depleted their savings and was forced to sell \ntheir homes in the United States. But Applicant never missed any mortgage payments on \nthose homes. (Response.) \nIn 2013, Applicant was diagnosed with a severe medical condition that was very \nexpensive to treat. The condition worsened in 2014, but his employer\u2019s medical insurance \ncovered the costs. In 2016, however, Applicant\u2019s employer changed medical insurance. \nAs a result, Applicant\u2019s medications cost him out-of-pocket expenses of $2,000 per \nmonth. He tried new medications that cost $500 per month, but those medications were \nineffective. Applicant went off medications for several months but had adverse results. \nTherefore, he resumed the $2,000 per month medications. As noted, Applicant\u2019s wife \nfound full-time employment in May 2016. (Response.) \nCountry A\u2019s cost of living increased while Applicant lived there. In 2014 his yearly \nhome rental was $23,000. By 2018 it rose to $26,000. The next year it went to $32,000 \nper year. Just before the pandemic in 2020, the landlord wanted $38,000 per year. \nApplicant did not want to terminate the lease because of substantial early termination \npenalties. He did, however, downsize in 2018 to a dwelling for $17,000 per year. Applicant \nlived there until he was transferred to Country B in 2020. Also, in 2018, Country A \nincreased taxes, and at the same time Applicant\u2019s employer reduced his pay by $250 per \nmonth. (Response.) \nIn 2019, after down-sizing his housing expense, cutting nonessential expenses, \nand his wife being employed, Applicant contacted a company about debt consolidation \nand financial repair. The company recommended Applicant contact each creditor to \ndiscuss settlement amounts instead of payment plans. That became Applicant\u2019s long-\nterm goal.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \n2020 credit report. AG \u00b6 19(a) applies.  \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances);  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.    \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). The SOR debts were not \nincurred that long ago. When the SOR was issued in April 2021, they were in arears on \nthe September 2020 credit report. Nor were the debts infrequent. I cannot find that AG \u00b6 \n20(a) applies. \nThe salient financial setbacks and Applicant\u2019s reactions to them are summarized \nbelow. They began after Applicant was transferred to Country A in September 2012. \n** Applicant\u2019s wife followed him in May 2013. Applicant and his wife counted on \nher to get a job, as they needed two incomes to make ends meet. Applicant\u2019s wife did not \nfind a job until February 2014.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n** Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job in April 2014. She was unable to find another job \nuntil April 2016. \n** During that period of unemployment, Applicant depleted his savings and sold \nhis two houses in the United States. \n** In 2013, Applicant developed a serious medical condition, the treatment for \nwhich was not fully covered by insurance, requiring him to pay $2,000 a month. \n** Between 2013 and 2018, Applicant\u2019s cost of living in taxes and rent increased \ndramatically. Applicant\u2019s salary was cut by $250 a month. \n** In 2018, Applicant downsized his rent and cut his living expenses. \n** In 2019, Applicant sought guidance from a financial advisor, who recommended he \nnegotiate settlements with creditors. \n** Not long after that guidance, Applicant took out a personal loan intended for settlements \nwith creditors. Those funds, however, were needed when Applicant was transferred in \n2020 to Country B. \n** In May 2020, Applicant completed his SCA and disclosed four of the SOR debts. \n** In April 2021, the SOR was issued. \n** In November 2021, Applicant settled his SOR debts. \nThe above summary identifies periods of unemployment, a costly medical \ncondition, a cut in salary, and raises in rent and taxes. Those are all conditions \u201clargely \nbeyond [Applicant\u2019s] control,\u201d as contemplated by AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant reacted to those \nsetbacks by using his savings, selling his two houses, downsizing his rent and living \nexpenses, and seeking financial guidance. That was responsible conduct by Applicant. \nThese all took place before Applicant completed his SCA and before the SOR was issued. \nI am not convinced that Applicant\u2019s resolution of his SOR debts was prompted by the \nsecurity clearance process. I find that Applicant mitigated his SOR debts under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(b), (c), and (d). \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person \nconcept in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n   FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 d.:  \n                            For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, \nbased on their accepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological \nand physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana, ecstasy, and mushrooms \n(Psilocybin) are classified as Schedule I controlled substances in \u00a7812(c), based on its \nhigh potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in \nmedically supervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). \nApplicant admitted two periods of marijuana use, including use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position from about October 2017 to \nFebruary 2018. There is also documentation in the record that shows that Applicant tested \npositive for marijuana in a 2015 pre-employment urinalysis screening. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), \nand 25(f) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility; and  \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant gets some credit under \u00b6 26(a). He reported last using marijuana in 2018, \nwhich was four years ago. While some of his life circumstances at that time were unique, \nothers were not. Although he asserted that he had not used marijuana between 2008 and \n2017, the 2015 positive urinalysis results and rescinded job offer bring that assertion into \ndoubt. The fact that he started using marijuana about a year after his clearance was \nsuspended for a positive urinalysis is particularly egregious.

He did not report the full extent of his usage on his 2008 SCA. He \nfailed to report marijuana use on his 2013 SCA and 2020 SCA. His urinalysis tested \npositive for marijuana in 2015, and he offered several different explanations over time. \nThese explanations are not credible considering the larger context of his known usage \nand failure to report. At the hearing, his testimony was vague and evasive at times. He \nhas repeatedly stated to investigators that he has no future intent to use marijuana, but \nthe record shows that those assertions did not hold true. He stated that in 2017-2018, \nmarijuana is what he used to get him through the pain and depression. While he reported \nthat he discussed his marijuana use at counseling, he failed to provide sufficient evidence \nshowing that he has had substance abuse counseling and that he took any other actions \nto ensure that he does not turn to marijuana in the future. He did not provide an \nassessment or prognosis from a duly qualified medical professional. He also failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence that he has disassociated from drug-using associates and \ncontacts, changed or avoided the environment where drugs were used, or provide a \nsigned statement agreeing to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and 26(d) do not apply. \nApplicant made a commitment to the government and his employer not to use \nillegal drugs when he initially applied for a security clearance, and in subsequent \nreapplications. This issue was reinforced by his 2016 clearance suspension for a positive \nurinalysis. His subsequent drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position shows that he cannot be trusted to follow the rules and \nregulations required to handle and protect classified information. The Appeal Board has \nheld that \u201ca person who broke a promise to abide by drug laws after having been placed \non notice that drug use is not compatible with access to classified information has not \ndemonstrated the quantum of reliability expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.

AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor regarding his \nmarijuana use has occurred multiple times over about a nine-year period. His \nexplanations and excuses for his failure to report are not credible. In 2020, he failed to \nreport it on his SCA despite using marijuana only about two years prior. Furthermore, he \ntold the background investigator that he was scared that if he reported it, he would not \nget his clearance. In his 2021 interrogatory response, he under reported his later period \nof marijuana use significantly, by about four months. I also found his testimony at the \nhearing to lack candor and be evasive. This behavior is ongoing, and there is insufficient \nevidence that it is unlikely to recur. It continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e cross alleges the Guideline H and Guideline F concerns under \nGuideline E. As explained below, as I found mitigation for Applicant on the Guideline F \nconcerns, I will find for him on this allegation as well. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe Guideline F allegation of a charged-off credit card is established by the credit \nreports and Applicant\u2019s admission. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \nand 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, E, and F in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nApplicant mitigated the financial concerns, but did not provide sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse, and personal conduct security \nconcerns. This continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment with respect to his eligibility for a security clearance. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 2.b - 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on June 28, 2022 The \nhearing was held on August 5, 2022. On August 8, 2022, I proposed that this case was \nappropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not \nobject. \nThis case involves six allegations of delinquent debt (consumer and medical \ndebts) under Guideline F. Applicant has paid all the delinquent debt listed in the SOR. \nWhile the medical debt and paying his motorcycle debt came after the issuance of the \nSOR, he credibly explained this was due to him having to wait to receive the proceeds \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfrom his insurance settlement due to a vehicle accident that caused his medical injuries. \nHe further admitted that the delinquent consumer debt he generated was at a time when \nhe was young, immature, and not fully understanding the ramifications of having bad \ndebts on his overall financial wellbeing. He credibly stated that he has learned from his \nmistakes and presented evidence that he is now in a good financial state. I believe it is \nunlikely Applicant will find himself in a similar position in the future. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubts \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

His then-employer, a DOD contractor for whom he had been working since \nJuly 2013, placed him in a non-billable status and he was uncompensated for \napproximately 15 to 45 days. His four-month period of unemployment in 2015 further \nexacerbated his situation. (Tr. at 32-35, 60-62, 100, 102-103; GE 1) \nApplicant believed that the SOR debts had been resolved by their removal from \nhis credit report due to the statute of limitations. After receiving the SOR, he realized that \nhis belief was erroneous. He was unable to reach the SOR creditors when he attempted \nto do so after he received the SOR, to which he attributed the expiration of the statute of \nlimitations. In May 2022, he began working with a nonprofit credit counseling organization. \nHe learned from the credit counseling organization that he could still resolve his \noutstanding debts, even though they were no longer reported on his credit bureau reports. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe contracted with the credit counseling organization, at $989 monthly for 36 months, to \nlocate his creditors and resolve his outstanding debts.

(Tr. at 24-30, 35-38, 41-42, 45, \n47-48, 51, 65-72, 83-87, 95-98, 103; AE A, B, J) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are two charged-off auto accounts, for $13,092 and $12,002, \nrespectively. Applicant financed the car in SOR \u00b6 1.a for approximately $16,000, and the \ncar in SOR \u00b6 1.b for approximately $14,000, in around 2012. After he could no longer \nafford to pay his monthly car payments, he reached out only to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nand unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a reduced payment. Both of the cars were \nrepossessed in around 2014. He could not recall whether either creditor notified him of \nan outstanding balance after repossession, or whether he made any payments to either \ncreditor between 2014 and May 2022, when the credit counseling organization made its \nfirst payments to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b on his behalf. Prior to working with the credit \ncounseling organization, he believed that he did not have any further obligation once the \ncreditors for both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b repossessed the cars. As previously stated, he \nintends to continue working with the credit counseling organization to resolve both of \nthese debts. (Supp Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 72-84; AE A, B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $1,145 television and internet services account in collection. \nApplicant returned the equipment when he switched providers in approximately 2019 or \n2020, but the company did not have a record of him doing so. He disputed the debt with \nthe company, and he was unaware that the company billed him for it until he reviewed a \ncopy of his credit bureau report in 2021. He paid this debt in April 2021.

(Supp Answer; Tr. at 41-44, 84-87; AE D, E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $3,502 charged-off credit card. Applicant contacted the creditor \nin 2022 and learned that the creditor issued an IRS Form 1099-C in December 2017, \nwhich cancelled this debt. He provided documentation to corroborate his claim. (Supp \nAnswer; Tr. at 44-48, 87-88, 92-93; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g are for two judgments entered against Applicant by his HOA, \nin October 2016 for $5,425 and in July 2019 for $3,852. When Applicant refinanced his \nmortgage, he mistakenly believed that money was automatically set aside from his \nmortgage payments and applied to his HOA dues. He later learned that he had to pay his \nHOA dues separately by check. His HOA dues accrued as he attempted to work with the \nmortgage company to resolve his outstanding HOA dues, culminating in both judgments. \nHe negotiated a consolidation of both judgments, and made a payment of $914 in April \n2021 and a payment of $1,829 for June and July 2021.

Since then, his \nHOA moved to an online system and he has timely paid his HOA dues of $110 monthly \nthrough automatic deductions from his bank account. He was current on his HOA dues \nas of the date of the hearing. (Supp Answer; Tr. at 48-52, 88-90, 99-100; GE 4, 5; AE A, \nG, I, J) \nSince March 2019 and through the date of the hearing, Applicant earned $125,000 \nannually. His monthly net income was $5,200 and his spouse\u2019s was $3,000. Since his \nmedical retirement, he also received $1,100 monthly for his 50% disability rating from the \nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. He received credit counseling in May 2022 from the \ncredit counseling organization, through which he also developed a budget. He was \ncurrent on his financial obligations, which included his mortgage; car payment for a car \nhe financed in August 2020; a $14,000 home improvement loan; and the $12,000 loan \nthat he obtained to resolve his outstanding HOA dues. His student loans of approximately \n$40,000 were in forbearance until approximately August 2022. He had savings allotted in \nhis budget with the credit counseling organization to pay his student loans monthly once \nout of forbearance. (Tr. at 20-27, 30-31, 51-55, 62-65, 74, 88-95, 98-100, 103-104; GE 6; \nAE A, H, I, J) \nApplicant continued to monitor his credit. He learned to stay diligent and proactive \nin resolving his financial issues before they become exacerbated. He timely filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns. A $595 state tax lien entered against him in August \n2017 was released in December 2018. Although he could not recall why the lien was \nentered against him, he paid it as soon as he learned about it. His May 2022 credit bureau \nreport reflects that he does not have any other delinquent debts. Character letters from \nthree individuals, including two lifelong friends of whom one previously served with \nApplicant in the U.S. military, all attested to his reliability, trustworthiness, and dedication. \n(Tr. at 20-27, 30-31, 51-55, 62-65, 74, 88-95, 98-100, 103-104; GE 6; AE A, H, I, J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d are applicable. Applicant has a history of not being able to \npay his debts. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He provided documentation \nreflecting that he resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g. Before he received the SOR, the \ncreditor cancelled SOR \u00b6 1.e in December 2017; he paid SOR \u00b6 1.c in April 2021; and he \nnegotiated a consolidation of the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g and then made a \npayment of $914 towards that consolidation in April 2021. He established good-faith \nefforts to repay his debts by his efforts both before and after he began working with the \ncredit counseling organization in May 2022. He intended to abide by his payment plan \nwith the credit counseling organization so that he could continue to resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. His finances are under control and they no longer cast doubt on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

It was delayed because Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel developed COVID-19. The hearing was rescheduled for April 1, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria). Applicant objected to some of the \nFederal background documents because they were published in 2019. He did not object \nto the relevance of the documents. He objected because the documents were unduly \nprejudicial as Applicant has no control over what happened in Nigeria. (Tr. 11) I offered \nApplicant the opportunity to supplement the record with more recent documents, but no \nadditional documents were submitted. The objection concerns the weight of the \nevidence, and it was overruled. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Nigeria. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor.

She sponsored him into \nthe United States, and Applicant entered the United States on November 28, 2014, at \nage 28. They were married in the United States in December 2014. They separated in \nDecember 2018, because she was spending their income quicker than they could earn \nit. The divorce was final in January 2021. His son, age four, was born in the United \nStates. He shares custody of his son with his son\u2019s mother. Applicant and his ex-wife \nhave a friendly, amicable relationship. She testified favorably at his hearing and \nprovided corroborating evidence to his prior statements and testimony. (Tr. 89-95) \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on June 11, 2019. He renounced his \nNigerian citizenship on February 8, 2021.

(Tr. 62-63) There is no evidence to show that Applicant \nor any of his family members have any connection to the Nigerian government, military, \nor police. Applicant testified that he and his family are Christians. Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in Nigeria receive no benefits or pensions from the Nigerian government. His \nparents earn money from renting part of their home. (Tr. 86) \nSince immigrating to the United States in 2014, Applicant provided financial \nassistance to his parents about four times for a total of about $300. He stated the last \ntime he provided financial assistance to his parents was in 2017. He traveled to Nigeria \nin 2016 and 2018 to visit his family. He has frequent telephone contact with his family in \nNigeria, but their conversations are limited to family matters and health related \nquestions. \nApplicant has no property or financial interests in Nigeria, other than a small bank \naccount with about $2.00 on it that he cannot close. To close the account, he would \nhave to travel to Nigeria and obtain a Nigerian identification card, which he does not \nwant to do. Applicant bought a home in the United States in 2021 for $365,000. He and \nhis son reside in their home during the weeks he has custody of him. Applicant has a \n$21,000 retirement account, and two bank accounts with about $5,000. \nApplicant considers the United States his home. He expressed his undivided \nloyalty to the United States. He is loyal to this country, and he is a patriotic person. He is \ngrateful to be here and for the opportunities the United States provides for him and his \nson. His sisters in Nigeria would also like the opportunity to immigrate to the United \nStates. He credibly testified that his family in Nigeria could not be used to coerce or \nintimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he would report any attempt \nto do so. \nApplicant called four witnesses, and he submitted letters attesting to his excellent \njob performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his professionalism, work \nethic, reliability, honesty, dependability, and trustworthiness. (AE 1 Tabs B-G and K-Z) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant parents and sisters are citizens and residents of Nigeria, except for an \nolder sister who is residing in Scotland while attending school. Applicant has no \nproperty or financial interest in Nigeria. The last time he traveled to Nigeria was in 2018. \nNotwithstanding, the potential for terrorist and other violence against U.S. interests and \ncitizens remains high in Nigeria, and it continues to have human rights problems. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Nigeria. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding sensitive information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 2014 and became a U.S. citizen in \n2019. His son was born in the United States. He purchased a $365,000 home in the \nUnited States and owns a $21,000 retirement account. He expressed his undivided \nallegiance to the United States, which he considers his home. He credibly testified that \nhis family in Nigeria could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing \nclassified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Nigeria are outweighed by his deep and long\u00ad\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the \ninterests of Nigeria. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable, and AG \u00b6 8(f) is partially applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted all of the allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.s). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this employer since April 2017. Her job title is backup lead and she is making about $21 per hour in this position. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She is unmarried and does not have any children. She currently lives with her disabled parents. This is her first application for a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 18-20, 32; GE 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges 12 student loan accounts totaling approximately $43,000, that were referred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l) Applicant stated that about six months following her college graduation in 2013, she was required to start repaying her student loans that she used to fund her college education. She did not pay on her student loans as required, nor did she contact the student loan creditor to explain why she was unable to make payments. When the creditor contacted her for payment, (date unrecalled), she told them that she could not afford to make any payments. Her paycheck was garnished (dates unrecalled) for a period of time, and she also had some of her Federal income tax refunds intercepted and applied to her delinquent student loans. Applicant testified that she has never \u201cvoluntarily\u201d made a payment on her student loans. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1, GE",

On April \n13, 2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted all of the allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \nthrough 1.s). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this \nemployer since April 2017. Her job title is backup lead and she is making about $21 per \nhour in this position. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She is unmarried and does \nnot have any children. She currently lives with her disabled parents. This is her first \napplication for a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 18-20, 32; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges 12 student loan accounts totaling approximately $43,000, that \nwere referred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l) \nApplicant stated that about six months following her college graduation in 2013, she was \nrequired to start repaying her student loans that she used to fund her college education. \nShe did not pay on her student loans as required, nor did she contact the student loan \ncreditor to explain why she was unable to make payments. When the creditor contacted \nher for payment, (date unrecalled), she told them that she could not afford to make any \npayments. Her paycheck was garnished (dates unrecalled) for a period of time, and she \nalso had some of her Federal income tax refunds intercepted and applied to her \ndelinquent student loans. Applicant testified that she has never \u201cvoluntarily\u201d made a \npayment on her student loans. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \nDepartment Counsel questioned Applicant why she listed in her SOR response \nthat half of her student loans were in \u201cgood standing\u201d and the other half were \u201cclosed.\u201d \nApplicant testified that due to the pandemic and the CARES ACT, her credit report \nshowed that about half of her delinquent student loans were now considered in good \nstanding. The credit report also showed the other half of her student loans were closed, \nwhich she considered meant that she no longer owed any money even though she has \nnever voluntarily made payments on these accounts.

Applicant listed in her SOR response that these accounts were \npaid. During the hearing she testified that after completing her security clearance \ninvestigative background interview, she paid these medical accounts in full. She no longer \nhad documentation to show that these accounts were paid, but she stated that she could \nobtain documentation from her bank account to corroborate her claim. The record was \nheld open for two weeks, but Applicant failed to provide supporting documentation. These \nmedical accounts remain unresolved. (Tr. 27-30) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p through 1.s allege four student loans delinquent in the amount of \napproximately $2,041, with a total combined balance of $25,373. Applicant had also listed \nthese loans as being in good standing in her response to the SOR. At the time of the \nhearing, the CARES Act emergency relief for student loans was set to expire on May 1, \n2022. She had never voluntarily paid on these loans after her college graduation in 2013, \nbut stated that she had recently saved about $1,000. It was her intention to start repaying \nher student loans after the CARES Act expired. Three days after this hearing, President \nBiden extended the CARES Act pandemic relief for individuals holding Federal student \nloans until August 31, 2022. (Tr. 30-32; SOR response) \nApplicant testified that she nets about $1,300 in her bi-weekly paychecks with her \nhourly wage of about $19.15. Shortly before the hearing she received a job promotion, \nand her new hourly pay increased to about $21. A review of her financial obligations \nshowed that she does not pay rent to her parents, but she contributes money for other \nexpenses. After deducting her expenses from her monthly net pay, she was left with a \nmonthly remainder of over $1,100. I asked Applicant why she was unable to make better \nprogress with her unpaid debts since she certainly had the financial means to do so. \nApplicant admitted that she does not like parting with her money during these uncertain \ntimes, and worries that she will end up with no money at all. She had never participated \nin financial counseling, and she does not maintain a monthly budget. (Tr. 33-44) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$46,700, the majority of which stems from 16 delinquent student loans. The record \nestablishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. Discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant stated that she did not have enough income to pay her student loan \naccounts despite continuous employment with a DOD contractor since April 2017. After \na review of her financial obligations, it is clear she earns sufficient money to pay on some, \nif not all, of her delinquent accounts. Once she realized that her delinquent finances were \na concern to the Government after participation in her background interview, she claimed \nto have paid her three delinquent medical accounts. She failed to provide documentation \nto support her claim. In light of her finances, I find that repaying her student loans has not \nbeen a priority for Applicant, especially when taking into account she was fully employed \nfor almost three full years before the pandemic hit our country. \nThere is no requirement that an applicant immediately resolve all financial issues \nor make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \ngood-faith efforts to pay delinquent debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time, may \nbe sufficient. An applicant\u2019s mere promises to pay debts in the future, without further \nconfirmed action, are inadequate. \nApplicant did not provide any supporting documentation about her financial \nresources or show why she was unable to make greater progress resolving her delinquent \nSOR debts before the SOR was issued. Although she meets the criteria under the CARES \nAct to state her student loans are currently \u201cin good standing,\u201d a review of her previous \nseven-year history must be considered. During that time period Applicant failed to show \nthat she has dealt with her student loan creditors responsibly, or that she established a \ngood-faith effort to repay her financial obligation. Applicant\u2019s promises to pay her student \nloans at some point in the future, without further confirmed action, fail to remove the \nlingering doubts that remain whether she has demonstrated the judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to abide by well-established rules and regulations that is required for granting \na security clearance. I find that Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this \nemployer since April 2017. In 2013, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree. She was able to \nattend college after obtaining student loans to fund her education. Her unwillingness to \nmake good-faith efforts to repay the delinquent student loans when she has the financial \nmeans to do so shows she cannot always be trusted to fulfill her promises. Her financial \nhistory raises unmitigated questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid rent, unpaid \npersonal loans, and unpaid utilities. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his and his now estranged spouse\u2019s \noverspending. He was unemployed at times in 2018 and 2020, and he separated from \nhis spouse in 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s marital separation and unemployment were beyond his control. \nApplicant\u2019s overspending was within his control. \nApplicant provided documentary corroboration that the $765 debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b and the $3,502 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e were paid prior to the issuance of the \nSOR. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e are concluded for Applicant. \nThere is no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution of the \nremaining SOR debts. Applicant stated that he intends to pay some of the SOR debts. \nHowever, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant states that he has paid some of the other debts in the SOR, but he \nprovides no documents to corroborate his payments of these debts. It is reasonable to \nexpect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Applicant also claims that \nsome of the debts in his SOR are no longer a concern because they do not appear on \nhis credit reports. However, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report \ndoes not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the \ndebt. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2015). Without additional, \ncredible evidence, the absence of Applicant\u2019s debts on a later credit report does not \nnecessarily show that Applicant has favorably resolved those debts. \nApplicant states that one of the SOR debts was \u201can error\u201d but fails to articulate a \nreasonable basis to dispute this debt, nor does he provide documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of his unarticulated dispute. (AG \u00b6 20(e)) \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nRecently, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in \npertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life to \ndetermine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if at \nall, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination.

Additional information is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA Clarifying Guidance), at page 2. \n7 \n1  \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. She voluntarily disclosed her methamphetamine \npossession and use, during her OPM ESI, and she disclosed her methamphetamine and \nmarijuana use in her response to DOHA interrogatories, SOR response, and at her \nhearing. She has never been arrested for a drug-related offense. She indicated she was \nwilling to abstain from future marijuana and methamphetamine possession and use. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I or II controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and \nmethamphetamine is a Schedule II controlled substance. See Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, Drug Scheduling listing at https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-\nscheduling/. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe SOR did not allege under Guideline H that Applicant tested positive during her \nprobation urinalysis test in August 2019 for methamphetamine, and it did not allege she \nfailed to disclose her marijuana use in January 2020 during her April 15, 2020 OPM ESI. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The non-SOR allegation will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and methamphetamine even though she \nwas aware that she held a security clearance. She knew possession of \nmethamphetamine was illegal. An applicant who uses illegal drugs after having been \nplaced on notice of its employment or security significance \u201cmay be lacking in the qualities \nexpected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d See generally ISCR Case No. 17-\n03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant described a circumstance beyond her control, which adversely affected \nher finances. Her boyfriend charged purchases on her credit cards without her \npermission. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or \nin part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider \nwhether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) provide: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.

Discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that are relevant to this \ncase are as follows: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana or methamphetamine or both in 2018, \n2019, and 2020. These offenses are already alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. They are \nsufficient for an adverse determination under Guideline H. SOR \u00b6 2.a is mitigated as a \nduplication. \nApplicant shoplifted four to six times in 2018, and she was arrested four times for \nshoplifting. Her involvement with her boyfriend at the time, who was a thief and drug user \nwas responsible in part for her bad decisions. Her shoplifting has not recurred since 2018 \nand is not recent. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.e are mitigated. \nSecurity officials are aware of Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse \nand four misdemeanor convictions for shoplifting-related offenses. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H, F, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old project management analyst who has worked for her \ncurrent DOD contractor employer since February 2020. In 2011, she received her \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2013, she received a master\u2019s degree in criminal justice and \nbehavioral analysis. She has held a security clearance since October 2011. There is no \nevidence of security violations. \nApplicant disclosed her marijuana and methamphetamine possession and use \nduring her OPM ESI or DOHA interrogatories or both, on her SOR response, and at her \nhearing. An honest and candid self-report of drug abuse is an important indication that, if \ngranted security clearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national \nsecurity, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career \nor personal reputation. However, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is \nundermined by her marijuana and methamphetamine possession and use while holding \na security clearance. Her methamphetamine use as recently as August 2019, and her \nmarijuana use as recently as January 2020 are too recent to be fully mitigated at this time. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of abstention from possession and \nuse of illegal drugs, and a better record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she \nmay well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance \nworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant mitigated personal conduct and financial \nconsiderations security concerns; however, she failed to mitigate drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

While in the service, he received eligibility to access to classified information \nat the top-secret level. He testified that his clearance was transitioned to his civilian \npositions and that it was continued until about 2017-2018. \nApplicant work history shows he worked for four different federal contractors \nbetween June 2008 and February 2016. He disclosed on his May 20, 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA) that he was terminated from his job in February 2016, \nbecause of insubordination and \u201cconduct detrimental due to miscommunication with the \ncompany\u2019s CEO\u201d.

He was hired by his current \nemployer and security sponsor, a large federal contractor, in December 2021. His \nemployment is conditioned on him receiving access to classified information. He is \nearning about $133,000 a year. He worked for his prior employer between July 2019 and \nSeptember 2021.

Except for these short periods of unemployment, Applicant has been \ncontinuously working for federal contractors since 2008. \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on May \n20, 2020, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his job. In his \nanswers to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, he disclosed he was \ndelinquent in two accounts including the car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a (surrendered in \n2004, and owing $23,651); and the state\u2019s child support enforcement agency account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c ($15,462 in arrearages). In his 2020 SCA, He stated he was only \n$9,000 delinquent. He failed to disclose in his 2020 SCA any of the other seven delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant explained that his financial problems were the result of periods of \nunemployment and underemployment.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant admitted he was terminated from the company. At his hearing, he claimed that \nhe submitted a leave form and left for another state to visit his family. The leave form was \nnot received by his employer. His customers complained, his employer called him, they \nhad a heated conversation, and he was fired. Applicant expressed remorse for his \nbehavior and losing the job after working for the company during three years. \nI note that in September 2020, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he was \nworking with employer K during the day and employer G at night. When employer K found \nout about it, he was fired. (GE 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged Applicant was terminated from his employment with a federal \ncontractor (G) in 2017, after the customer he was supporting asked for his removal from \nthe contract. Applicant admitted he was removed from the contract, but denied he was \nterminated. He believed that his employer was looking for another contract where he \ncould be placed. He claimed he was never told he was terminated. He resigned his \nposition and went to work for another contractor within two weeks of his removal. (Tr. 21-\n22) G\u2019s letter to Applicant, dated March 6, 2017, stated that the purpose of the letter was \nto inform him that he was being terminated, effective March 20, 2017. (GE 2) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged nine delinquent debts, totaling about $88,420, \nwhich include three charged-off consumer credit accounts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d) \nThe first two are defaulted auto loans, and the third is a delinquent credit card account. \nThe remaining six accounts are all consumer, medical, or credit accounts in collection. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, and 2.e through 2.i) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with \nclarifications. \nThe status of the financial SOR allegations follows: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a ($29,128) concerns a defaulted car loan from 2004. Applicant claimed \nhe was unable to make the loan payments after his contract ended and he was laid off. \nHe has made no payment since 2004. He claimed he attempted to contact the creditor or \nthe subsequent collection agencies to arrange for payments, but the account had been \ntransferred, and then \u201cmysteriously\u201d dropped from his credit report. He failed to present \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate his claim of attempted contacts with the creditor or \nsubsequent collection companies. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b ($23,651) alleges a defaulted car loan from 2016. Applicant purchased \nthe car in 2014-2015. He was unable to make the car payments after he was terminated, \nand the car was repossessed. He has made no payments since 2016.

He presented no documentary evidence of his contacts with the creditor, the \nstate agency, of any payments made, or of other efforts to resolve the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 2.f ($769) alleges a cable services account in collection. Applicant claimed \nhe learned about this delinquent account while checking his credit report before he \nreceived the SOR. He claimed he paid the account. He presented no documentary \nevidence of his contacts with the creditor, of payments made, or of other efforts to resolve \nthe debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($651) alleges a communications service provider account in collection. \nApplicant claimed he paid the account and reestablished his service. He presented no \ndocumentary evidence of contacts with the creditor, of any payments made, or of other \nefforts to resolve the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($641) alleges a medical account in collection. Applicant believes the \ndebt is for medical services for his daughter. He believes his daughter\u2019s mother resolved \nthe debt. He presented no evidence to show the account was paid or otherwise resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($11,145) alleges a delinquent car loan in collection. He explained he \nsurrendered the car after losing his job in 2008 because of the financial crisis. He \npresented no documentary evidence of contacts with the creditor, of any payments made, \nor of other efforts to resolve the debt. \nApplicant believes that circumstances beyond his control prevented him from \naddressing his SOR debts between the time they became delinquent and September \n2021, when the SOR was issued. He averred that his periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment adversely affected his ability to pay his financial obligations.

Additionally, \nhis employer offered him a bonus of up to $45,000 a year, provided he receives eligibility \nfor access to classified information at certain levels. (AE 2) He promised to pay off his \nremaining delinquent accounts when he receives his bonus. Although he has been \nemployed with his current employer since December 2021, he presented no evidence of \nany payments made to any of the SOR creditors, except for the child support payments \ndeducted from his pay check. \nApplicant\u2019s recent credit report shows a change in delinquent debt from $88,000 \nto $34,000, primarily because some debts have fallen of his credit report for being seven \nyears old. He argued that the accounts are resolved and this shows his credit payment \nhistory is getting better. He presented no documentary evidence of any contacts with \ncreditors, of any settlements made, of payment agreements established, or of any \npayments made before or after the SOR was issued. He presented no evidence showing \nthat he has participated in any recent financial counseling, although, he claimed he \nreceived financial counseling while he was in the Navy. After the hearing, he submitted a \nbudget that he claimed he is following to correct his financial problems. (AE 3) \nApplicant expressed hope that his new job and anticipated bonus would allow him \nto get his financial problems corrected and to establish his financial responsibility. He \ndoes not understand the seriousness of having negative information on his credit or what \nit takes to establish financial responsibility. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information.

However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . \nApplicant was terminated by employer K because he was working for both \nemployer K and G (another government contractor) at the same time. I have considered \nall the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, education and background, his admissions to \nthe background investigator in 2020, and G\u2019s letter to Applicant indicating he was being \nterminated. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant admitted that he was terminated by K in his 2020 SCA, and he provided \nan explanation consistent with prior statements he made to OPM investigators in 2020. \nHe believed that G did not terminate him, but merely removed him from the contract. \nConsidering the passage of time, Applicant\u2019s discussions with an OPM investigator, his \ndisclosures in the 2020 SCA, and at his hearing, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b mitigated \nunder the five personal conduct mitigating conditions above. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admitted, and the evidence corroborates he has nine \ndelinquent debts, totaling about $88,420, which include three charged-off consumer credit \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d); and six accounts in collection. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, and 2.e \nthrough 2.i). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he has \nresolved any of the SOR allegations. These are ongoing debts that have been delinquent \nfor many years. Applicant claimed circumstances beyond his control prevented him from \naddressing his delinquent debts, i.e., periods of unemployment and underemployment in \nbetween jobs. \nWhile I accept that Applicant\u2019s financial problems may have been aggravated by \ncircumstances beyond his control, his evidence is insufficient to show that he was \nfinancially responsible under his circumstances. \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since at least 2008. He knew \nor should have known of the periods of unemployment or underemployment in between \ncontracts and should have anticipated and planned for such occasions. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to show his emergency or contingency plans in the event of future \nunderemployment and unemployment. Moreover, I find that his terminations in 2016 and \n2017 were due to his own misconduct. As such, his terminations cannot be considered \nas a circumstances beyond his control. \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 SCA does not indicate unemployment periods beyond a couple \nweeks or months in between contracts or jobs. Except for those periods of unemployment, \nApplicant has been fully employed by federal contractors since 2008. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of efforts to contact his creditors, \nof payments made, settlements agreements, or payment plans established before or after \nhe received the SOR in September 2021. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His evidence \nis insufficient to explain why he was unable to address his delinquent accounts more \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndiligently. All of the SOR accounts remain unresolved and have been delinquent for many \nyears. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. His financial issues are recent and \nongoing. They continue to cast serious doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, 49, served five years on active duty in the Navy and four years in the \nActive Reserve. He has been working for federal contractors since at least 2008, while \npossessing eligibility for a clearance. He acquired nine accounts that became delinquent \nand have been delinquent for many years. He submitted no documentary evidence of his \nefforts to resolve any of the delinquent accounts. He failed to establish his financial \nresponsibility. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. He should \nhave been more diligent addressing and resolving his delinquent accounts. The record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make \ngreater documented progress sooner to resolve the SOR debts. He did not provide \npersuasive documentary evidence showing he made specific and reasonable offers to \nsettle the SOR debts. His lack of documented responsible financial action in regard to \nthese SOR debts raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations, with explanations. However, concerning the Guideline E allegations involving providing false information or failing to provide truthful information, Applicant denies intentionally doing either. I have incorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old.

The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n26, 2021, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 16, 2021. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1-3, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant \ntestified and offered one exhibit (AE A), which was admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The record remained open until November 26, 2021, but Applicant did not \nsubmit any additional evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 29, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations, with \nexplanations. However, concerning the Guideline E allegations involving providing false \ninformation or failing to provide truthful information, Applicant denies intentionally doing \neither. I have incorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is married, but is currently separated. He has two \nchildren, ages six and three. He has a high school diploma. He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since March 2020 as an electronic maintenance technician. He has \nnever held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application (SCA) \nin May 2020. He was never briefed by the company facility security officer about filling \nout the SCA. (Tr. 6, 20-22, 39-40; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant: used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from August 2007 to the present; was arrested in January 2007 and charged \nwith possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia; and intends to continue using \nmarijuana. (See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant: \ndeliberately failed to disclose his 2007 marijuana charge when completing his security \nclearance application (SCA) in May 2020; falsified answers to a defense investigator \nduring his background investigation in September 2020 when he deliberately failed to \ndisclose his 2007 charge of marijuana and paraphernalia possession; and deliberately \nfailed to disclose his illegal drug use in the last seven years when completing his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) in May 2020. The drug allegations were also \ncrossed-alleged under Guideline E. (See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.d) \nIn January 2007, when Applicant was 18 years old and in high school, he and a \nfriend had used marijuana before arriving at school one day. School officials became \naware of possible marijuana use by Applicant and notified the police. When the police \narrived on scene, a search of Applicant\u2019s car revealed the presence of a marijuana \n\u201cbong\u201d and a small amount of marijuana. The police arrested Applicant and took him to \nthe police station. He was detained there for approximately two hours and then released \nto his parents. He was never placed in a jail cell. He does not recall going to court to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndispose of the matter. He believes that it was treated similar to receiving a traffic ticket \nwhere you just pay a fine. He did not hire an attorney for this matter. His mother paid \nthe fine for him. Applicant had no further involvement with this case. While the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence documented Applicant\u2019s arrest, there is no Government \nevidence reflecting the disposition of the matter. (Tr. 23, 31-33; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant admitted using marijuana infrequently in the past, aside from the 2007 \nschool incident. He testified that his last use was in December 2019, before taking his \ncurrent job. His use of marijuana occurred in a state where marijuana use has been \nlegal, under state law, since 2012. Applicant asserted his use occurred during this time. \nBefore being interviewed by an investigator during his background check, he was \nunaware that marijuana use remained illegal under federal law. He has never held a \nfederal job or federal contractor job before his current position. (Tr. 25-26, 32-33) \nAlso during his background check, he answered questions regarding any future \nuse of marijuana. The investigator attributed the following statements to Applicant: \nIn the future, [Applicant] will stop using if told by his current employer to \nstop. However, [Applicant] has not been informed that he is not allowed to \nuse marijuana. If his employer asks, [Applicant] will be honest and report \nthat he is using marijuana. (GE 2) \nApplicant credibly asserted that this information was misconstrued to indicate that he \nhad a future intent to use marijuana. He denies having such intent. He now knows that \nmarijuana use is illegal under federal law and he has no intention to ever use it. Even if \nmarijuana use became legal under federal law, he would not use it. He is willing to take \nregular drug tests to verify his commitment not to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 27, \n34-36; SOR Answer) \nWhen Applicant completed his SCA in May 2020, he did not intend to provide \nfalse information about the 2007 school-marijuana incident. He truly, albeit incorrectly, \nbelieved that his arrest was handled similar to a traffic ticket since he did not go to jail, \ndid not go to court, and his mother just paid a fine. In a similar fashion, Applicant did not \nlist his marijuana use within the last seven years because the question asked for \n\u201cillegal\u201d drug use and because his use of marijuana was legal under state law and he \nwas unaware of the federal prohibition of marijuana use. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. (Tr. 18, 23, 25-26, 28; SOR Answer) \nDuring his background interview in September 2020, he answered negatively \nwhen asked if he had been charged with any drug offense, even when he was young. \nHe answered this way because in his mind the 2007 school-marijuana incident was not \na charged offense. Once the investigator explained that a police report showed \nApplicant\u2019s arrest, he fully disclosed the details of the incident. There is no documentary \nevidence to show the disposition of this offense. This is also when the investigator made \nhim aware that marijuana use violated federal law. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible.

His supervisor recognized Applicant as a highly valued team member \nwho sets a positive example. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana and possessed marijuana and a bong at school in \n2007, for which he was arrested. At various times between 2012 and 2019, Applicant \nused marijuana in a state where marijuana use is legal under that state\u2019s law. He was \nnot a federal employee or federal contractor employee at the time of those uses. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was sporadic, but it ceased in 2019. His marijuana \npossession charge was over 14 years ago. He has credibly expressed his intent not to \nuse it in the future. He has established an excellent reputation at work where he is a \nvalued and trusted employee. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. His nearly two years of abstinence \nand commitment to abstinence in the future are sufficient circumstances to demonstrate \nApplicant\u2019s intent not to use in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s sporadic marijuana use and possession is sufficiently covered by the \nGuideline H concerns making AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) inapplicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant was under the mistaken belief that the 2007 school-marijuana arrest was \nnever a formal charge since he did not go to court for its disposition. This led to his \nerroneous answers on his SCA and to the investigator during his background check. \nAdditionally, he believed his use of marijuana in the time period seven years before he \ncompleted his SCA in May 2020 was legal under state law and he was unaware of its \nfederal status. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s assertions are credible and that he did not \nhave the requisite intent to deceive when he gave erroneous information in completing \nhis SCA and when he provided answers to the investigator. The evidence does not \nestablish deliberate falsification or omissions as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.d. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and circumstances of the conduct; (2)the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s abstention from \nusing marijuana, his declared intention not to use it ever again, and his outstanding \nperformance appraisal. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and the concerns under Guideline E were not \nestablished. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal 2012 through \n2019, and state 2012 through 2019 income tax returns. He also filed for Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy in October 2014. \nIn his answer, Applicant admits the allegations with \nexplanation. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in October 2019. (Government \nExhibit 1.) \nHis security clearance application shows that he has had steady \nemployment from November 2011 through October 2019. He then started working for \nhis current employer in October 2019, and there have been no interruptions in his \nemployment. Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2012 through 2019. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant states that he has now resolved all of his Federal and state income tax \nfilings. (Government Exhibit 2.) Documentation in the record shows that he filed his \n2012 Federal income tax return in October 2014, and his 2015 and 2016 Federal \nincome tax returns in May 2020. (Government Exhibit 4.) Regarding his 2017, 2018 \nand 2019 Federal income tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service shows no returns \nhave yet been received. (Government Exhibit 4.)  \nA letter from the state tax authorities dated June 10, 2021, indicates that they \nhave no record of his tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, \n2018 and 2019. Applicant asserts that he has no tax liability to either the Federal or \nstate governments. In accordance with Federal and state laws, Applicant states that he \nunderstands his responsibility to file annual Federal and state income tax returns in a \ntimely fashion. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant simply forgot to file his income tax returns for the years in question. He \nstated that he suffers from a health condition that he has had for the last ten years, \nwhich causes him to struggle with his memory and the ability to stay on task. He stated \nthat unless it is something that he does routinely, he has difficulty remembering to do it. \n(Government Exhibits 2 and 4.) \nIn October 2014, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. He stated that he \ndiligently followed the trustee\u2019s repayment plan for four and a half years through \nautomatic payments deducted from his paycheck, until he received a bill from the \ntrustee stating that he owed over $1,000 for lack of payments. Applicant was confused \nand does not understand how the incorrect amount was deducted from his paycheck. \nApparently due to an administrative error caused by the trustee handling the account, \nthere was insufficient monies deducted each month during the five-year plan. Applicant \nwas unable to come up with the lump sum amount of money needed at the end of the \nfive-years to pay off the creditors, and so the Bankruptcy was dismissed in 2019. He \nstates that he ultimately cashed in his retirement account and paid off the remaining \ncollection accounts he was aware of. He believes that he has satisfied all of the \ncreditors involved in the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated April 12, 2020. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) In response to Section 26, Financial Record, he was asked, \u201cIn \nthe past (7) seven years have you failed to file or pay federal or state, or other taxes \nwhen required by law or ordinance?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d, and failed to disclose \nthat information as noted in Guideline F above. \nApplicant denies that he did this deliberately. He states that he answered all of \nthe questions to the best of his ability. He indicates that he has a memory problem and \nsight loss issues brought on by his health problem. (Government Exhibit 2.) Based \nupon Applicant\u2019s memory problem, it is possible that he may not have remembered that \nhe failed to file Federal and state income tax returns at the time he completed the \napplication. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired;  \nApplicant failed to file Federal and state income tax returns for a number \nof years, and only recently filed some of them when confronted with his security \nclearance eligibility. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not abide by the Federal and state tax laws. He failed to file his \nFederal and state income tax returns in a timely manner for at least eight years. The \nfailure of Applicant to act in a timely manner shows a defect in character. \nCircumstances beyond his control, namely his memory problem, may have cause him to \nforgot to file his annual income tax returns. If so, this would certainly impact his ability \nto properly protect classified information. \nApplicant did not file an extension to \naccommodate his circumstances, nor did he contact anyone to help him file his returns \non time. Instead, he ignored the situation until it became a problem. Applicant has not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. There is no justification for his failure to file \nhis income tax returns, or anything else in the record, to mitigate this violation of the tax \nlaws. This demonstrates a lack of judgment and reliability needed to be eligible for \naccess to classified information. \nApplicant attributes his heath condition as partially responsible for his failure to \nfile his income tax returns on time. Understanding that his health condition impacts his \nability to comply with Federal and state tax laws, he should have sought out assistance \nto help him file his returns on time. As long as he is gainfully employed and earning \nsufficient monies, he is still required to file his annual income tax returns on time. \nVoluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. If he cannot follow the tax rules, he very well may not be able to follow the \nrules required to protect classified information. It was only when his tax delinquencies \nwere an impediment to his security clearance that he took action to get some of his \nincome tax returns filed. Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that Applicant \nmade a good-faith effort to resolve these delinquencies. \nNone of the mitigating \nconditions apply. This guideline is found against the Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant failed to answer the question correctly in response to whether he had \nany delinquent income tax filings. Since he is applying for a security clearance, it can \nbe assumed that he understood the question. If his memory problem caused him to \nanswer the question incorrectly, he cannot be found eligible for access to classified \ninformation, as he may forget how to be properly protect classified information. On the \nother hand, if he did not answer the question accurately in an attempt to conceal his \nfailure to file his returns from the Government, he is still ineligible for access to classified \ninformation for his untrustworthiness. Deliberately concealing material information from \nthe government on a security clearance application raises serious questions about \none\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness. In either case, Applicant is not eligible for access \nto classified information. Under the particular circumstances of this case, none of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable. This guideline is found against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant repeatedly failed to \ntimely file his Federal and state income tax returns. His actions do not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of judgement and reliability required of person eligible for access to \nclassified information. And then, to provide false information about the filings on his \nsecurity clearance application is just as troubling. \nInsufficient mitigation has been \nshown. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.   \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and cross-alleges under Guideline K (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that, in about April 2018, Applicant committed a security violation by exiting a classified area with classified papers in his possession, and that he failed to self-report that violation to his facility security officer (FSO). After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 61-year-old senior engineer. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) He and his spouse married in September 1994, and they have two sons, ages 30 and 28. Applicant was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in October 1991, a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2002, and a master\u2019s degree in October 2012. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from July 1979 to February 1982, when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He retired after 20 years of active-duty service in May 2002. He started working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in September 2003. He held a top-secret clearance when he was in the Navy and for his work with his employer until 2018.

On March 1, 2022, the Government indicated it was ready to proceed to a \nhearing. On March 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. After some coordination of schedules with the parties, on \nMay 12, 2022, I scheduled a hearing for June 7, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GE 1-3) and one \nApplicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant, his \nspouse, and his supervisor testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on \nJune 23, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and cross-alleges under Guideline \nK (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that, in about April 2018, Applicant committed a security violation by exiting \na classified area with classified papers in his possession, and that he failed to self-report \nthat violation to his facility security officer (FSO). After considering the pleadings, exhibits, \nand transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old senior engineer. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) He and his spouse \nmarried in September 1994, and they have two sons, ages 30 and 28. Applicant was \nawarded an associate\u2019s degree in October 1991, a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2002, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in October 2012. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from July 1979 to \nFebruary 1982, when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He retired after 20 years of active-duty \nservice in May 2002. He started working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in \nSeptember 2003. He held a top-secret clearance when he was in the Navy and for his work \nwith his employer until 2018. He was granted access eligibility for sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI) in December 2016. In April 2018, his clearance eligibility was \ndowngraded to the secret level; his SCI access eligibility was withdrawn; and he was \nremoved from a classified program following his commission of a security violation in April \n2018. (GE 1, 3; Tr. 55-56.) The details of the April 2018 incident are as follows. \nBecause of his experience, high level of clearance, and work demands, Applicant \nwas tasked with working on a classified project as well as carrying out his normal duties in \nApril 2018. (GE 3; AE A.) That project required him to access a closed area outside of his \nnormal worksite. (Tr. 24-25, 41.) Shortly before 11 a.m. on Monday, April 16, 2018, \nApplicant exited a closed area (SCI facility (SCIF)) with working papers containing \ninformation classified at the secret level. He intended to destroy the classified working \npapers. He was out of the closed area for about eight seconds when he noticed his \n\u201cmistake,\u201d returned to the closed area, and dropped the documents in a bin authorized for \ndestruction of classified documents.

About an hour later, co-worker X informed a security \nofficial at work about his concern that Applicant possibly deviated from security \nrequirements and did not report the incident. (GE 2.) \nOn Thursday, April 19, 2018, an all-hands security meeting was held with cleared \npersonnel to reiterate the security policies while working in the closed area and to remind \nthem about the requirement to self-report any deviations or incidents. All attendees at the \nmeeting, including Applicant, were encouraged to be more security conscious and \nreminded of their responsibilities for handling sensitive and classified information. By the \nday\u2019s end, Applicant had not reported his security violation to his program manager or to \nsecurity managers. (GE 2.) \nApplicant had a scheduled day off from work on Friday, April 19, 2018. When he \nreturned to work on April 23, 2018, he was informed by security personnel about his \nviolation, which he was required to self-report. Applicant provided a written statement to \nsecurity officials in which he explained that he did not self-report the incident as he \u201cdid not \nknow the seriousness of the matter.\u201d He indicated that \u201csoon afterwards,\u201d he discussed the \nmatter with two peers, who told him to self-report. However, he did not believe it was a \nsecurity infraction because he had maintained control of the document. He further \nexplained that after reading a warning sign against removing classified material from the \nsecure area (including classified \u201cYellow Paper\u201d), which was posted on the inside exit door \nof the closed area, and attending the all-hands security meeting, he determined self-\nreporting was necessary, but he was off from work on that Friday, April 19, 2018. As to why \nit happened, Applicant stated: \nThis occurred simply because I walked the wrong way. I intended to destroy \nthe working copy that I was using and ended up walking a more familiar route \nto exit the area. Although I now know the seriousness of this event, and had \nthe chance to self-correct, at the time I treated the classified material as a \nnormal courier. To make things worse, I disregarded peer help to self-\ncorrect. I put myself, my reputation and my standing before what was the \nright thing to do regarding this physical security matter. (GE 2.) \nIn accord with its reporting requirements under Intelligence Community Policy \nGuidance (ICPG) 704.2, Applicant\u2019s employer issued a security access eligibility report \n(SAER) to the DOD on May 10, 2018, concerning Applicant\u2019s security violation and failure \nto self-report. The security manager who authored the SAER expressed concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and integrity. When asked whether he had exited the closed area \nwith a classified \u201cYellow Paper,\u201d Applicant was very reluctant to admit his conduct and tried \nto rationalize why he did it. The security manager found it troubling that Applicant did not \nrealize the seriousness of the incident. Applicant reportedly questioned the security official \nabout where it stated that \u201cYellow Paper\u201d could not be removed from the closed area even \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthough initial and refresher security briefings stressed that such material could not be \nremoved, and that the use of \u201cYellow Paper\u201d was spelled out in the closed area\u2019s standard \noperating procedures, which Applicant read and acknowledged on being briefed into the \nprogram. The security manager also reported that Applicant exhibited a lack of candor with \nco-worker X by denying, when asked, whether he had removed classified material from the \nclosed area. Co-worker X recounted in a written statement, which was appended to the \nSAER, that after he told Applicant to immediately turn around, return to the secure space, \nand report his action to security, Applicant countered with an apparent inquiry about \u201ceven \nif he retained control of the information.\u201d Co-worker X did not indicate in his written \nstatement that Applicant expressly denied having exited the secure space with a paper \ncontaining secret information. (GE 2.) Applicant maintains that he never denied exiting the \nclosed area with the classified paper or said \u201canything like that.\u201d (Tr. 53.) \nVideo-surveillance of the door to the closed area showed that only eight seconds \npassed between Applicant\u2019s exit from, and return to, the closed area with the classified \npapers in hand, but the security manager concluded that the risk of compromise of \nclassified information could not be completely discounted, as visual surveillance could not \nbe validated for about three seconds of time. Applicant\u2019s employer issued a written \nreprimand to Applicant; placed him in a probationary status for six months; and removed \nhim from the program. (GE 2.) \nOn July 6, 2020, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) for reinvestigation of his clearance eligibility in light of his April 2018 \nsecurity violation and failure to self-report. He responded negatively to an SF 86 inquiry into \nwhether his security clearance eligibility or access authorization had ever been denied, \nsuspended, or revoked, but commented as follows: \nFollowing a 2018 violation, I was administratively downgraded from TS to S, \nand removed from a program. I have since left that department at the \ncompany. (GE 1.) \nDuring a July 29, 2020 interview with an authorized investigator for the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant stated about the April 2018 incident that he \nwalked out of a SCIF with his lunchbox and folder without realizing that the folder had a \nyellow cover sheet. His intention was to find a microwave for a working lunch. Seconds \nlater, he returned to the SCIF when he realized his mistake. He attributed his failure to self-\nreport the violation to wanting to know what kind of violation he had made before reporting \nit, and explained that he could not verify that it was an infraction as there was no written \nprocedure in place that such materials could not leave the SCIF. He asserted that when \nasked by a security manager at work whether he had exited the closed area with classified \ninformation, he explained that he could not find a local instruction of an infraction in that \nregard.

(Tr. 40.) He was under \nschedule stress due to stalled and overdue projects on which he worked part time. He \nfound it \u201cimpossible [to] work both projects at the same time and would timeshare days \nbetween them.\u201d He acknowledged that the proper procedure would have been to ask \nsomeone in the closed area to handle his classified material for him when he left the area, \nbut he \u201cdid not know many employees there\u201d and so did not ask anyone to hold classified \nmaterial for him. Normally, he locked up his work when away from his temporary desk in \nthe closed area. (AE A; Tr. 41-42.) He testified that after the incident, he could find \u201cnothing \nin any procedure, written or otherwise, that classified material couldn\u2019t leave the SCIF.\u201d (Tr. \n46.) \nApplicant still feels shame and regret over the April 2018 incident. (Tr. 40.) He \nexpressed his understanding that neither his guilt over the incident nor workplace stress \njustifies his failure to self-report. He explained that he acted on his \u201cpersonal self and \nknowledge of right and wrong pertaining to the many security procedures in place\u201d gained \nfrom his security responsibilities and duties through the years, and he could find nothing in \nhis procedures, written or otherwise, that prohibited classified material from leaving the \nSCIF. (AE A; Tr. 42, 46.) Yet, he admitted on cross-examination that, based on many years \nof having a clearance and security training, he did not believe he was allowed to take \nclassified information from the SCIF; that he knew it was a security violation; and that he \nknew he had to report it. (Tr. 47.) As to why the all-hands security briefing of April 19, 2018, \ndid not prompt him to report the incident, Applicant responded, \nI\u2014I think that\u2014you know, that the amount of seconds had something to do \nwith it. I think that, you know, it\u2019s a lack of judgment on my part. It was\u2014it \nwas the---you know, the schedule and the problems I was having in a \nnumber of areas. I think that there was just a load on my mind, and---and it \nwas just downright bad judgment and wrong. (Tr. 50.) \nApplicant disputes the security manager\u2019s characterization that he was reluctant in \nadmitting that he exited the closed area with classified papers in hand on April 16, 2018. \nHe asserts that looking for a security instruction or procedure was something he had been \ndoing for about 40 years; that he knew he did wrong but that he was trying to find out how \nbad his violation was, and he \u201cran out of time\u201d in that security got to him first. (Tr. 52-53.) \nApplicant moved into his current work group in 2020. He held a secret clearance \nwith no issues until the SOR was issued. (Tr. 38.) His supervisor attests that Applicant has \nbeen a very reliable worker who takes pride in his work. He requests additional work if he is \nfinished with his assigned tasks, which currently do not require him to hold a security \nclearance. (Tr. 32-33.) If Applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility is adjudicated favorably, it would \nallow him to work on classified projects in their group. (Tr. 34.) The supervisor is unaware \nof the April 2018 security incident. Applicant offered to inform him of the reason for the \nhearing, but the supervisor thought it best not to know. (Tr. 36.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified about the seriousness with which Applicant takes his \nwork. To her knowledge, he has never revealed any classified information to her. (Tr. 19-\n20.) He was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the April 2018 incident.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nPersonal conduct security concerns under AG \u00b6 15 are established in two aspects: \n(1) Applicant\u2019s removal of papers containing information classified secret from a closed \narea in April 2018; and (2) his failure to self-report the security violation, despite being \ndirected by two experienced co-workers to go immediately to security and report the \nincident and being reminded of his security responsibilities during an all-hands security \nbriefing held a few days after the incident. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to self-report and his security violation of exiting a closed area \nwith classified information in his possession, when considered together, support a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, as contemplated within AG \u00b6 16(c), which \nprovides: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) have some applicability in this case. \nThey provide: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation of Applicant\u2019s failure to self-report. \nHe had held a security clearance for decades and SCI access eligibility since December \n2016. He would have had many security briefings over the years regarding his \nresponsibilities to report any known or suspected violations. Even assuming that he \nbelieved on April 16, 2018, that he may not have committed a violation because he had the \ndocuments in his possession during the eight seconds that he was out of the closed area, \nhe would have had good reason to question that belief after his conversation with co-\nworkers X and Y. Co-worker X clearly informed him that he had to report the incident to \nsecurity personnel. He did not go to security that day or the following day. He did not report \nit to security personnel even after an all-hands security briefing in which he was reminded \nof the security requirement to self-report. His failure to self-report was a continuing course \nof conduct in that it went on until he was confronted by security personnel on April 23, \n2018.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) supplies some mitigation for Applicant\u2019s security violation in that it \nappears to have been an isolated incident in a record of decades of classified access \neligibility for Applicant. The circumstances under which the violation occurred were unique \nonly in that it was on a program and a closed area outside of Applicant\u2019s usual job duties \nand work environment. His lack of familiarity with the workers in the SCIF does not mitigate \nhis security violation in that Applicant knew that he should have ensured that the classified \nmaterial was properly safeguarded before he exited the closed area. If he did not feel that \nhe could ask someone to hold the classified papers for him, then he had an obligation to \nsecure them in a classified storage container or other approved manner before he left the \narea. AG \u00b6 17(d) also has some applicability in that Applicant acknowledges that he \nremoved the classified papers from the closed area. While the risk of compromise of the \nclassified information could not be completely ruled out, video surveillance shows that he \nwas outside of the closed area with the classified information for only eight seconds. He \nreturned to the closed area once he realized his mistake in removing the classified \nmaterial. The personal conduct security concerns exhibited by his lapse of judgment in \nremoving the classified material are mitigated. \n \n  \nApplicant recognizes that neither his guilt nor his stress about the removal of the \nclassified information from the closed area explains his lack of judgment in failing to self-\nreport the violation. However, he displayed, as recently as during his direct testimony at his \nhearing, an unacceptable tendency to minimize, if not justify, his failure to self-report by \nclaiming that, \u201cas a procedure guy,\u201d he wanted to determine for himself what type of \ninfraction he committed, or even whether he had committed a security violation, before \ngoing to security; that he could find nothing written which prohibited the removal of \nclassified material from the SCIF; and that he just \u201cran out of time.\u201d By waiting until cross \nexamination to admit that he did not believe he was allowed to remove classified material \nfrom the SCIF; knew it was a security violation; and that he had an obligation to report the \nincident, he undermined his case in reform. Applicant lacks a track record of persuasive \nevidence showing that he can be counted on to candidly report when it may be personally \ndisadvantageous to him to do so. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not fully apply. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns raised by his failure to self-report the security violation are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nThe security concerns for handling protected information are articulated in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information\u2014which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information\u2014raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant committed a security violation when, in April \n2018, he exited a closed area with papers containing information classified at the secret \nlevel, and by his failure to report that security violation to his employer\u2019s security personnel. \nIn addition to the standard operating procedures for the SCIF, which Applicant violated per \nthe SAER, \u00b6 5-100 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual \n(NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M, dated February 2006, as amended, indicates that cleared \nindividuals are responsible for safeguarding information entrusted to them. Under \u00b6 5-306 \nof the NISPOM, access to closed areas is limited to authorized persons who have an \nappropriate clearance and a need-to-know for the classified information in the area. \nPersons without the appropriate security clearance and need-to-know must be escorted at \nall times. Access is controlled to protect and maintain the security of the classified \ninformation in the closed area. The objective of perimeter controls is to discourage the \nintroduction or removal of classified material without proper authority. See NISPOM \u00b6 5-\n103. \nRegarding the failure to self-report, contractors are required under \u00b6 1-302 of the \nNISPOM to report adverse information that comes to their attention concerning cleared \nemployees. NISPOM \u00b6 1-303 requires the report of any loss, compromise, or suspected \ncompromise of classified information. To ensure its compliance with those security \nrequirements, Applicant\u2019s employer briefed its cleared employees about their obligation to \nreport known adverse information, including about violations of the NISPOM\u2019s security \nrequirements. NISPOM \u00b6 3-106 specifically requires that prior to being granted access to \nclassified information, an employee is to receive an initial security briefing that includes (a), \na threat awareness briefing; (b) a defensive security briefing, (c) an overview of the security \nclassification system, (d) employee reporting obligations and requirements, and (e), \nsecurity procedures and duties applicable to the employee\u2019s jobs. The SAER indicates that \nApplicant had been briefed about his reporting requirements before and after the April \n2018 incident. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the \nprotection of classified or sensitive information,\u201d is established. \nApplicant has the burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by his violation \nof the rules and regulations for handling protected information and his failure to comply \nwith his reporting requirement. AG \u00b6 35 provides for mitigation, as follows: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant\u2019s removal of the classified papers from the SCIF was inadvertent in that he \ndid not intend to circumvent security regulations. He realized his mistake almost \nimmediately as he returned to the closed area after only eight seconds. While AG \u00b6 35(a) \nhas some applicability in that the violation \u201chappened so infrequently,\u201d the importance of \nreporting a known security violation is clear in AG \u00b6 35(d), which requires that even \ninadvertent security violations be promptly reported. Applicant had several opportunities to \nreport the incident to security officials, and he failed to do so. His efforts to justify or \nminimize his violation by claiming to security officials on April 23, 2018, that he could find \nno written procedure or policy, when, in fact, a warning was posted on the door of the \nclosed area, shows that the all-hands security training held on April 19, 2018, had little \nremedial affect. It was not demonstrated that his security violations were due to improper or \ninadequate training or unclear instructions. Applicant has yet to demonstrate a positive \nattitude toward the discharge of his security responsibilities, given his reluctance to admit \nthat he knew he had an obligation to report the violation. The handling protected \ninformation security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not designed to punish \napplicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. That said, failure to report a deviation or \nviolation of security procedures raises considerable doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to protecting classified information. It is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). For the reasons previously \ndiscussed, doubts persist as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guidelines E and K, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant handled classified information for decades \nbefore his security violations at issue in this case. His long record of apparent compliance \nwith security regulations weighs in his favor in that he has shown that he can handle \nclassified information appropriately. At the same time, because of his years of experience \nin handling classified information, he can reasonably be expected to have known to report \nany derivation, intentional or not, from security requirements. In choosing to ignore the \nadvice of co-worker X to immediately report his removal of classified papers from a closed \narea, Applicant put his self-interest ahead of his security obligations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for Applicant.

Lynch, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/31/2022 \nDecision \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant honorably retired from the Marine Corps. He made significant progress \nresolving the five debts listed on the statement of reasons (SOR). He established a track \nrecord of debt payments. His connection to a former Saudi Arabian enlisted person began \nwhen they worked together in Saudi Arabia and ended in October 2021. Guideline F \n(financial considerations) and B (foreign influence) security concerns are mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 10, 2020, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1). On March 12, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February \n20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the CAF did not find under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (Hearing \nExhibit (HE) 1) \nOn April 5, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing. (HE 2) On December 15, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On December 17, \n2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued an electronic notice setting his \nhearing on January 3, 2022. On December 20, 2021, Department Counsel provided an \namended SOR adding SOR \u00b6 2.a, which is an allegation under Guideline B. (HE 3) On \nDecember 20, 2021, Applicant responded to the amended SOR. (HE 3) Applicant did not \nobject to the amendment of the SOR, and the motion to amend the SOR was granted. \n(Tr. 24) His hearing was held as scheduled. \nAt hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant objected to the \ninformation that he was aware his security clearance was previously revoked; and with \nthat clarification accepted, Department Counsel\u2019s exhibits were accepted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 20-24; GE 1-7) Applicant offered five exhibits; there were no objections; \nand all proffered exhibits were admitted. (Tr. 20-25; GE 1-7; AE A-E) On January 10, \n2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. After the hearing, Applicant provided \ntwo exhibits, and Department Counsel provided one exhibit. (AE F-G; GE 8) There were \nno objections, and all post-hearing exhibits were admitted into the record. (AE F-G; GE \n8) The record closed on January 17, 2022. (Tr. 102; HE 4) \nLegal Issues \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice concerning the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia). (Tr. 28) Applicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice. (Tr. 30) Administrative or official notice is the appropriate \ntype of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, \nAdministrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice). \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice concerning Saudi Arabia \nis granted. Department Counsel\u2019s request is substantially quoted in the Saudi Arabia \nsection with minor grammatical and punctuation changes and deletions, and without \nfootnotes. Some incidents involving terrorists are omitted. Applicant had no connection to \nthese incidents. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted he incurred the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.e. (HE 2) He also admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a that he had a friendship \nwith AK, a Saudi citizen then serving as a Saudi enlisted man. He provided mitigating \ninformation and proof of some payments to his creditors. (HE 3) Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen who is 45 years old. (GE 1) He has been \nemployed since July 2020 as a maintenance controller working in the Middle East (not \nSaudi Arabia) for an ally of the United States on high-performance fighter aircraft sold to \nthe Middle Eastern country by U.S. companies under the Foreign Military Sales program. \n(Tr. 31) He served on active duty in the Marine Corps from 1987 to 2007. (Tr. 7) He \nhonorably retired as a staff sergeant (E-6). (Tr. 7) He did not receive any disciplinary \nactions in the Marine Corps such as nonjudicial punishment or written reprimands. (Tr. 7-\n8) He served two tours in Iraq. (Tr. 8) In 1987, he earned a high school diploma. (Tr. 7) \nHe has two years of college; however, he does not have a degree. (Tr. 7) In 2013, he \nmarried his spouse in Saudi Arabia, and his children with his spouse are ages four, seven, \nand eight years old. (Tr. 10) His wife and children are living in Australia. (Tr. 10) \nFinancial Considerations \nOn January 16, 2003, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility \nissued Applicant a letter of intent (LOI) to revoke security clearance, which raised security \nconcerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and F (financial considerations). (GE 5 \nat 3) The 2003 SOR alleged that Applicant failed to disclose any delinquent accounts on \nhis October 11, 2000 SCA. (GE 5 at 5) His 2003 SOR also alleged his November 8, 2000 \ncredit report indicated: he had two accounts that were previously at least 120 days past \ndue; one paid judgment; two paid collection accounts; and three delinquent collection \naccounts for the following amounts: $260; $1,089; and $679. (GE 5 at 5) Applicant did \nnot respond to the 2003 LOI; and his security clearance was revoked on January 3, 2004. \n(GE 5 at 1) Applicant said he was deployed to Iraq when his clearance was revoked, and \nhe was never informed that his security clearance was revoked. (GE 2 at 2) \nIn 2013, Applicant was injured in a traffic accident in Saudi Arabia. He incurred \nmedical bills and lost part of his salary when he was unable to work. (Tr. 85-87) In 2015, \nhe had back surgery, and he missed five months of work. (Tr. 89; SOR response) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, who lives in Australia, had medical problems. Applicant funded \nhis spouse and children\u2019s travel from Saudi Arabia to Australia four times to enable his \nspouse could care for her father. (Tr. 61, 76-79; SOR response) In 2016, he only received \npartial pay for six months because his employer was having difficulty with renewing a \ncontract in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 90-91; GE 2 at 2) \nIn August 2019, Applicant traveled to Australia for 21 to 30 days. (Tr. 72) It cost \nabout $2,800 for him to travel from Saudi Arabia to Australia and return to Saudi Arabia. \n(Tr. 79) In July 2019, Applicant returned to the United States for treatment of a heart \nailment, and he missed work for 10 months. (Tr. 36, 88-90; GE 1; HE 2) He received the \n3 \n\n \n \n \nmedical treatments for his heart from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 36) \nHis only source of income while unemployed was his Marine Corps retirement. (Id.) \nIn May 2020, Applicant started working with his creditors. (Tr. 66-67) In June 2020, \nhe began working for a large U.S. contractor supporting a foreign air force at an overseas \nlocation. (GE 1 at 14; Tr. 38) In August 2020, he completed his SCA, and he indicated he \nplanned to resolve his delinquent debts as soon as his employment became stable. (GE \n1) In September 2020, he had his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI), and he related that he was using automatic payments to pay one \nlarge debt. (GE 2) He promised to establish payment arrangements with his other \ncreditors. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s June 15, 2021 credit report shows eight accounts in paid status, \nand six accounts in collection or charged-off status. (GE 3) He has not taken any \ninternational travel away from his place of employment since July 2020. (Tr. 82) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has five delinquent accounts totaling $61,148, as \nfollows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a charged-off credit union debt for $19,375. Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nindicate the account was opened in October 2015 (account ending in 89). (Tr. 52-53; GE \n3 at 7; GE 4 at 2) He started to miss payments in May 2018. (Tr. 53; GE 4) Applicant\u2019s \nMarine Corps retirement check is deposited into the credit union identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nand the credit union uses the funds to make payments to address the two credit union \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. (Tr. 62, 67) \nOn July 31, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the $13,765 balance for a single \npayment of $3,441; however, Applicant did not pay the settlement amount. (AE C at 3) \nApplicant provided receipts showing the following payments to address the account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. \nDate of Payment \nAmount of \nPayment \nBalance \nExhibit \nOctober 2, 2020 \n$683 \n$18,693 \nSOR response at 7-8 \nNovember 4, 2020 \n$330 \n$18,363 \nSOR response at 10, 12 \nDecember 2, 2020 \n$512 \n$17,851 \nSOR response at 13 \nJanuary 8, 2021 \n$463 \n$17,131 \nSOR response at 14 \nFebruary 27, 2021 \n$372 \n$16,469 \nSOR response at 16, 17 \nMay 29, 2021 \n$989 \n$14,115 \nAE C at 1 \nJune 5, 2021 \n$350 \n$13,765 \nAE C at 2 \nAugust 3, 2021 \n$350 \n$13,415 \nAE C at 3-5 \nSeptember 1, 2021 \n$775 \n$12,640 \nAE C at 6-7 \nOctober 13, 2021 \n$452 \n$12,187 \nAE C at 8-9 \nOctober 30, 2021 \n$589 \n$11,599 \nAE C at 10 \nNovember 16, 2021 \n$279 \n$11,320 \nTr. 56; AE C at 11-12; GE 7 at 3 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off credit card debt for $19,323. (Tr. 57-59; AE A; GE 7 at \n4) On April 6, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the debt for a single payment of $1,932, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor two $966 payments which were required to be made on May 5, 2021, and on June 4, \n2021. (AE A at 1) On May 18, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the debt for a single \npayment of $2,898, or two $1,449 payments which were required to be made on June 16, \n2021, and on July 16, 2021. (AE A at 2) On June 28, 2021, the creditor wrote that \nApplicant authorized a $1,449 payment by phone on June 28, 2021. (AE A at 3) The \ncreditor said a check would be sent to Applicant for the second $1,449 payment. (Id.) It \nis unclear why the creditor would send a check to Applicant unless there was another \naccount with the creditor. (AE A at 3) On June 29, 2021, the creditor offered to settle the \ndebt for a single payment of $2,898, or two $1,449 payments which were required to be \nmade on July 28, 2021, and on August 27, 2021. (AE A at 4) The June 29, 2021 letter \nindicated the amount of the debt was reduced to $17,874. (Id.) On June 29, 2021, and \nJuly 5, 2021, the creditor wrote that one payment of $1,449 was due on July 16, 2021, to \nresolve the debt, and the payment would be made using a credit card. (AE A at 5-6) On \nJuly 27, 2021, the creditor wrote the final payment was received in accordance with the \nsettlement agreement; however, if the payment was returned for any reason the account \nwould go into default. (AE A at 7) \nOn July 29, 2021, the creditor wrote the settlement agreement was cancelled \n\u201cbecause of missed or returned payments,\u201d and the debt would be turned over to a \ncollection agency. (AE A at 8) Applicant provided a spreadsheet showing two payments \nto the creditor: on June 28, 2021, he paid $1,449; and on January 9, 2022, he paid $894. \n(AE F) All of the letters from the creditor cite the same account number. Applicant said he \nmade both of the payments to settle the debt. (Tr. 57-59, 100-101) I requested that \nApplicant provide documentation showing the second payment to the creditor. (Tr. 91-93) \nHe provided a spreadsheet which shows the $1,449 payment and the $894 payment; \nhowever, the spreadsheet does not show the balance or available funds on August 27, \n2021, when the final payment was due. (AE F) He did not provide proof of a payment in \nAugust 2021. Applicant\u2019s failure to make the second payment may have been due, at \nleast in part, to having his mail sent to his mother\u2019s residence in the United States, and \nshe only sent his mail to the Middle East once a month. (GE 2 at 2; AE A, address on \ncorrespondence from creditor is his mother\u2019s address) The balance owed as of January \n9, 2022, is $16,980. (GE 7 at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a charged-off credit union debt for $14,545. The debt originated from \na vehicle loan (the account number ends in 05).

(Tr. 35; GE 1) From 2012 to 2016, he worked closely \nwith AK, who was Applicant\u2019s supervisor when he worked at an air base in Saudi Arabia. \n(Tr. 17, 39; GE 1 at 23-24) AK was enlisted in the Saudi Air Force. (GE 1) Applicant \nenjoyed recreational activities with AK and others in the mountains or deserts during off-\nduty time. (Tr. 40, 49) After leaving the employment where he worked closely with AK, \nApplicant and his family continued to live in Saudi Arabia, and they socialized with AK \nand his family. (Tr. 41-42) For example, they went shopping and had dinner together in \nrestaurants. (Tr. 41-42) \nIn 2017, Applicant moved his family from Saudi Arabia to Australia because he \nwas concerned about the conflict between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis in Yemen. (Tr. \n75-77; SOR response) See Administrative Notice. His spouse is a citizen of Australia, \nand she is not a citizen of the United States. (Tr. 75-77) In 2017, his spouse was unable \nto obtain a Visa to the United States in a timely manner. (Tr. 75) She did not return to \nSaudi Arabia after 2017. (Tr. 77) She has never traveled to the United States. (Tr. 97-98) \nApplicant, his spouse, and children intend to eventually move to the United States. (Tr. \n98) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \nThe last time Applicant physically met AK was in 2018. (Tr. 42) The last time he \nreceived a communication from AK was in October 2021 on social media. (Tr. 43, 46-47) \nThere were about 15 Saudis in the same social media group. (Tr. 47) \nAK left the Saudi Air Force, and he currently works for a U.S.-owned company that \ndoes work for the Saudi Arabian Air Force providing maintenance support on U.S.-\nmanufactured aircraft in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 44-45) AK was trained in the United States by \na large defense aerospace contractor. (Tr. 45) Applicant does not believe that AK had \nany connections to intelligence entities. (Tr. 45-46) No Saudi ever asked Applicant to do \nanything inappropriate or to provide any sensitive information. (Tr. 48) He does not have \nany property or bank accounts in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 49) He does not owe any money to \nanyone in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 50) \nSaudi Arabia \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by King Salman bin Abdulaziz \nAl Saud, who is both head of state and head of government. The 1992 Basic Law sets \nout the system of governance, rights of citizens, and powers and duties of the \ngovernment, and it provides that the Quran and Sunna (the traditions of the Prophet \nMuhammad) serve as the country\u2019s constitution. It specifies that the rulers of the country \nshall be male descendants of the founder, King Abdulaziz (Ibn Saud). \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory regarding \nSaudi Arabia, advising U.S. travelers not to travel to Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19 \u2026 \nreconsider travel to Saudi Arabia due to the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian \nfacilities, and exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to terrorism. The U.S. \nDepartment of State advises not to travel within 50 miles of miles of the Saudi-Yemen \nborder, as well as to the cities of Abha, Jizan, Najran, and Khamis Mushayt; the Abha \nairport; and Qatif in the Eastern Province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah due to \nmissile and drone attacks and terrorism. \nMissile and drone attacks perpetrated by Iran and Iran-supported militant groups \nrepresent a significant threat. The Islamic Republic of Iran has supplied Yemen-based \nHouthis and other regional proxy groups with weapons to conduct destructive and \nsometimes lethal attacks using drones, missiles, and rockets against a variety of Saudi \nsites, including critical infrastructure, civilian airports, military bases, and energy facilities \nthroughout the country, as well as vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Recent attacks \nwere aimed at targets throughout Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran, \nJizan, Khamis Mushayt, the civilian airport in Abha, Al Kharj, military installations in the \nsouth, as well as oil and gas facilities. U.S. citizens living and working near military bases \nand critical civilian infrastructure, particularly near the border with Yemen, are at \nheightened risk of missile, drone, and rocket attacks. \nTerrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may \nattack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, \nmarkets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni \nand Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners. \nMilitant groups in Yemen have attacked Saudi border towns and other sites in \nSaudi Arabia with armed drones, missiles, and rockets. Civilians that are near the border \nwith Yemen are especially at risk. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in \nSaudi Arabia including in Qatif. \nSaudi Arabia suffered from numerous terrorist incidents in 2019 (the most recent \nyear for which the U.S. State Department\u2019s report was published). Terrorist incidents \nincluded both external attacks by Iranian and Houthi actors and small-scale attacks, \nlargely perpetrated by lone offender actors including, ISIS sympathizers. Militants \ninstigated violence using IEDs, gunfire, and UAS. [Several representative attacks in 2019 \nin Saudi Arabia were omitted.] \nOn December 6, 2019, a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force opened fire in a \nclassroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, killing three and wounding eight. The \ngunman, 2nd Lt Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was a student who was receiving training \nat the base. The FBI later noted that Alshamrani had coordinated with al-Qaeda in the \nArabian Peninsula (AQAP) before the terrorist attack, for which the latter claimed credit. \nIn an August 31, 2021 press statement, the U.S. Department of State condemned \na recent Houthi attack against Saudi Arabia that struck the civilian airport in Abha, \nwounding eight civilians and damaging a commercial airliner. The statement noted that \nsince the beginning of the year, Saudi Arabia has endured more than 240 attacks from \nthe Houthis, who have endangered the Saudi people alongside more than 70,000 U.S. \ncitizens residing in Saudi Arabia. \nSignificant human rights issues in Saudi Arabia in 2020 included: unlawful killings; \nexecutions for nonviolent offenses; forced disappearances; torture and cases of cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment of prisoners and detainees by government agents; \nharsh and life threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; political \nprisoners or detainees; serious restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, \nincluding threats of violence or unjustified arrests or prosecutions against journalists, \ncensorship, site blocking, and engaging in harassment and intimidation against Saudi \ndissidents living abroad; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly \nand freedom of association; severe restrictions of religious freedom; restrictions on \nfreedom of movement; inability of citizens to choose their government peacefully through \nfree and fair elections; violence and discrimination against women, although new \nwomen\u2019s rights initiatives were implemented; trafficking in persons; criminalization of \nconsensual same-sex sexual activity; and restrictions on workers\u2019 freedom of association, \nincluding prohibition of trade unions and collective bargaining. \nOn February 11, 2021, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence \nassessed that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an \noperation to capture or kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The report noted the Crown \nPrince\u2019s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad. It also stated \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat the Crown Prince had absolute control of the Kingdom\u2019s security and intelligence \noperations. \nOn February 26, 2021, the U.S. Department of State announced \u201cKhashoggi Ban,\u201d \na new visa restriction policy pursuant to section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. It further announced that it was imposing visa restrictions on 76 Saudi \nindividuals believed to have been engaged in threatening dissidents overseas, including \nbut not limited to the Khashoggi killing. \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant received the following Marine Corps awards: Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation Medal; Combat Action Ribbon (Operation Iraqi Freedom); Joint \nMeritorious Unit Award; Navy Unit Commendation (3); Navy Meritorious Unit \nCommendation; Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal (6); National Defense Service Medal \n(2); Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (East Timor); Southwest Asia Service Medal (2); \nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (Operation Iraqi Freedom); Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal; Korean Defense Service Medal; Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon (10); Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait); Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia); \nMeritorious Mast (5); Letter of Commendation; and Letter of Appreciation (2). (AE E) He \nreceived two marksmanship badges and completed numerous training courses. (AE E)   \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe relevant financial considerations mitigating conditions to this case under AG \u00b6 \n20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant described several circumstances beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances. He had multiple medical problems which caused periods of \nunemployment and resulted in some medical bills. His father-in-law had medical\nproblems, and Applicant\u2019s spouse traveled to Australia several times to care for her father. \nApplicant sent his family to Australia in 2017 because of the conflict between Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. He flew to Australia several times to be with his family. \n \n \nIn June 2020, Applicant was re-employed as a maintenance controller working in \nthe Middle East (not Saudi Arabia). The record shows that he began payments to some \nof the SOR creditors in October 2020. On March 12, 2021, the SOR was issued. His \nMarine Corps retirement pay went to the credit union holding the two largest SOR debts. \nHe reduced the balances of his five SOR debts from $61,148 to $40,128. \nIn ISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007) the Appeal Board noted \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s only voluntary efforts at debt repayment occurred close to the date of the \nhearing;\u201d nevertheless, the Appeal Board affirmed the grant of security clearance \nbecause of that applicant\u2019s good faith efforts to establish payment arrangements or pay \ndelinquent debts. The Appeal Board based their decision on application of AG \u00b6 20(d), \nand explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \nISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007) (internal citation and footnote \nomitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. \n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nMore recently, the Appeal Board has said, \u201can applicant who resolves financial \nproblems after being placed on notice his or her security clearance may be in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and self discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when \nthere is no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. \nBd. June 29, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016)). See \nalso ISCR Case No. 20-01510 at 4 (App. Bd. July 14, 2021) (reversing grant of security \nclearance where Applicant used debt consolidation loan to pay several debts after SOR \nwas issued). This notice could be in the form of completion of an SCA, OPM PSI, or SOR. \nApplicant had multiple reasons for his failure to keep five accounts in current status. In \nJune 2020, he obtained his current employment, and he started working with his creditors. \nIn sum, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. Applicant started working on establishing \npayment plans as soon as he became re-employed in June 2020, well before he received \nthe SOR, and he is progressing toward resolution of the five SOR debts. His actions show \nsufficient effort, reasonableness, good judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and good \nfaith. Applicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with AK create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and \u201ca potential conflict of interest \nbetween [his] obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \n[his] desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or \ntechnology.\u201d When Applicant first met AK, he was an enlisted person in the Saudi military. \nSaudi Arabia has a significant problem with terrorism and violations of civil rights. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nFor Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the foreign government involved and the \nintelligence-gathering history of that government are among the important considerations \nthat provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the \n[Administrative] Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights \nrecord is another important consideration.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another \nimportant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the \nUnited States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with anyone living in that country are vulnerable to foreign coercion or \ninducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, terrorism causes a substantial amount of death or property \ndamage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the \nUnited States. The relationship of Saudi Arabia with the United States and the situations \nin that country involving terrorists and criminals place a significant burden of persuasion \non Applicant to demonstrate that his contacts with AK do not pose a security risk because \nof the risks of attempts to influence him emanating from Saudi Arabia. Applicant should \n14 \n\n \n \n \nnot be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and concerns from entities in Saudi Arabia. \nThe issue in this case is whether Applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with foreign officials \nor residents create a potential vulnerability that a foreign entity could seek to exploit in an \neffort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information. Guideline B security or \ntrustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe \nUnited States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from or in Saudi \nArabia or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, \nnevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the future. Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with a resident in that country \u201ccould be a means through which [an a]pplicant \ncomes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with AK and through him to foreign government officials or \nterrorists in Saudi Arabia create a potential conflict of interest because those officials \ncould place pressure on Applicant in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified \ninformation. Those relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7(a). Department Counsel produced \nsubstantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationship with AK, a former Saudi enlisted person, \nwhich raises the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nin this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions Foreign Influence section, supra, \nApplicant had multiple contacts with AK, a former Saudi enlisted man currently residing in \nSaudi Arabia. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections to the United \nStates. He is a native-born U.S. citizen. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 20 years. \nHe honorably retired as a staff sergeant. His spouse and children live in Australia, not \nSaudi Arabia. Applicant no longer works in Saudi Arabia. He has not had any in-person \ncontact with AK since 2018, and his last social media contact was in October 2021. AK \nworks for a U.S. subsidiary in Saudi Arabia. AK was trained in the U.S. by a U.S. aerospace \ncompany. He has been entrusted with working on U.S. manufactured aircraft. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationship with AK, a former Saudi Arabian \nenlisted man. According to the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice regarding Saudi \nArabia, in 2019, there were 70,000 U.S. citizens living or working in Saudi Arabia. Like \nApplicant when he worked in Saudi Arabia, many of them work for U.S. companies \nproviding military support to the Saudi military. Many of them have daily contact with Saudi \nmilitary personnel in the course of their employment. Applicant lived in Saudi Arabia from \n2009 to 2018, and he worked with, formed a friendship with, and socialized with AK. He \ncontinued to communicate with AK after leaving Saudi Arabia. However, he had no in-\nperson contact with AK after 2018, and his last communication from AK was via social \nmedia in October 2021, before he received the Supplemental SOR on December 20, \n2021. Applicant\u2019s connections to AK are much less significant than his strong connections \nto the United States. Foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n16 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nB are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 45 years old, and he has been employed since July 2020 as a \nmaintenance controller working in the Middle East (not Saudi Arabia) for an ally of the \nUnited States on high-performance fighter aircraft sold to the Middle Eastern country \nunder the Foreign Military Sales program. He served on active duty in the Marine Corps \nfrom 1987 to 2007. He honorably retired as a staff sergeant. While in the Marine Corps, \nhe served two tours in Iraq. \nApplicant had multiple contacts with AK, a former military enlisted person in the \nSaudi Arabian military. These actions raise significant foreign influence security concerns. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Saudi Arabia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in that country. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Saudi Arabia is a \ndangerous place because of violence from terrorists and criminals, and Saudi Arabia does \nnot respect the full spectrum of human rights. Terrorists have the ability to aggressively \ntarget the United States to obtain an advantage over the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s years of Marine Corps service, including the dangers that service \nentailed, weigh towards mitigating security concerns. He has shown his patriotism, \nloyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his 20 years of Marine Corps service and \npost-Marine Corps retirement support to a DOD contractor. He served two tours in Iraq \nand received a Combat Action Badge as well as numerous other Marine Corps awards \nand ribbons. \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of service in a combat or hostile fire zone on behalf of \nthe United States: \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his [or her] ties \nand sense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR Case \n17 \n\nNo. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006). . . . See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. \n19, 2012). \nApplicant has a documented history of service in a combat zone. His 20 years of \nMarine Corps service increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and \nreport any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or \nexploit him. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). I have no doubt \nthat Applicant would not succumb to any pressure or coercion to compromise classified \ninformation, and he would report any such attempts. \nApplicant had a period of unemployment that ended in June 2020. He started \nmaking payments to his creditors in July 2020. Through payments to the five SOR \ncreditors after July 2020, he reduced the balances of his five SOR debts from $61,148 to \n$40,128. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis \nin financial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). \nApplicant understands what he needs to do to maintain his financial responsibility. \nHis efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-\npayment. I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations and \nforeign influence security concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n18 \n\n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the foreign preference and \nforeign influence security concerns. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin December 2019. (Exhibit 3) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP.

Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline B for foreign influence and Guideline C for foreign preference. \nApplicant answered the SOR in November 2021. She admitted all factual \nallegations made in the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6 1.c. She explained the allegation was \ninaccurate because she worked as a software developer for an Israeli company in the \nyears alleged as opposed to product manager. She also provided a two-page \nmemorandum in explanation. She did not provide supporting documentation. She \nrequested a clearance decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 28, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM).

She described her husband as an eminent scientist who is employed by the U.S. \nGovernment and a holder of a public trust clearance (which is typically for a non-\nnational security position). She stated that her U.S. citizenship is important to her, and \nshe took pains to have her three children obtain U.S. citizenship through the \nnaturalization process. She has sponsored her stepdaughter to obtain a green card, as \nher stepdaughter intends to come to the United States and live here upon completion of \nher studies in Israel. Her two sons are living with her and her husband. Her third child, a \n26-year-old daughter, has chosen to reside in Israel. \nApplicant has a number of family ties or connections to Israel. (Exhibit 4, \nAppendix A) Her daughter, sister, and brother are dual citizens of the United States and \nIsrael, and they reside in Israel. Her stepdaughter and sister-in-law are citizens of and \nresidents in Israel. Her brother-in-law is a dual citizen of Germany and Israel, and he \nresides in Israel. In the past she maintained contact with a person with whom she \nserved with in the IDF, but she is no longer in contact with him. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s family members have served in the IDF. (Exhibit 4, \nAppendix A) Her spouse served as an officer and aerial navigator. Her sister served as \nan intelligence officer. Her brother served as a target instructor. Her son served in \nlogistics. Her daughter served in operations. And her stepdaughter served as a military \nreporter. \nApplicant, individually or jointly with her husband, has financial interests in Israel. \n(Exhibit 4, Appendix B) She noted that she and her husband sold all of their Israeli \nsecurities and mutual funds, as she understood doing so was required by U.S. law. \nThey also sold their former residence in Israel in 2016, and they no longer own real \nestate in Israel. She described their current financial accounts in Israel as consisting of \na checking account, two educational funds, a life insurance policy, a life insurance \npension fund, and two provident funds (which I understand are long-term savings to \nsupport an employee upon retirement). She estimated the U.S. dollar value of these \nfinancial holdings at about $1 million in total. Concerning foreign-based income, her \nhusband receives a pension from an Israeli university in the amount of about U.S. \n$8,600 monthly. \nIn addition to their Israeli financial interests, Applicant noted that she and her \nhusband own their U.S. home, which has an estimated market value of more than $1 \nmillion. She also noted that they have more than $1.5 million in U.S. mutual funds and \naccounts. Their current net worth is approximately $3 million. (Exhibit 4 at 9) \nApplicant travels frequently to Israel. For example, she made ten trips to Israel \nduring November 2014 and November 2019. (Exhibit 4, Appendix C) She uses her \nIsraeli passport to enter and depart Israel, as required by Israeli law. Likewise, she uses \nher U.S. passport to enter and depart the United States, as required by U.S. law. \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning the country of \nIsrael. (Exhibit 6) Israel is a nation in the Middle East, and it is governed by a multiparty \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparliamentary democracy. Israel and the United States have historically strong bilateral \nrelations and ties, including cooperation on defense and security matters. With that said, \nU.S. officials remain concerned about the potential for Israeli espionage. The most \nnotable example is perhaps the case of Jonathan Pollard, a former intelligence analyst \nfor the U.S. Government. He pleaded guilty in 1987, as part of a plea agreement, to \nspying for and providing top-secret classified information to Israel, for which he was \nsentenced to life in prison. The current State Department travel advisory for Israel is do \nnot travel there due to COVID-19, and the advisory warns to exercise increased caution \nin Israel due to terrorism and civil unrest.  \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4 Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials. \n1 Department of the Navy v.

Under Guideline B for foreign influence, \nthe suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into doubt due to foreign \ncontacts and interests. The overall concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

The heightened-risk \nelement is satisfied given the risk of terrorism in Israel as well as concerns about the \npotential for Israeli espionage against the United States. Israel stands in contrast to \ncountries that pose a low national security risk; for example, Canada, United Kingdom, \nAustralia, and New Zealand, all of which belong to (with the United States) the Five \nEyes intelligence alliance for joint cooperation in signals intelligence. Given Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to Israel and financial interests in Israel, the above disqualifying conditions \nare raised by substantial evidence. \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nIsrael presents a heightened risk and places a heavy burden on Applicant to \nmitigate the security concern. With that said, Applicant has various indicators of a \nmature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. She has an employment history in \nboth Israel and the United States. She and her husband are both financially responsible \nand successful. They have been homeowners, past and present. She appears to have \ncooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process. \nHer responses in her SF 86 and her responses to written interrogatories were \nmeticulous and professional. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties and connections to Israel. She \nwas born in the United States and departed the country as a minor child with her \nparents. The majority of her upbringing, her education, and her adult life were in Israel, \nwhere she lived for about 40 years. She has lived in the United States as an adult for \nless than ten years. Understandably, she maintains ongoing relationships with various \nfamily members in Israel, including an adult daughter and an adult stepdaughter. She \ntravels frequently to Israel for vacation as well as to maintain those relationships. She \nalong with her husband have substantial financial interests in Israel, estimated at about \nU.S. $1 million. Their Israeli financial interests are less than their U.S. financial interests, \nbut they are not minor or trivial to say the least. On balance, I cannot conclude that her \nties and connections to the United States are far stronger than her ties and connections \nto Israel. My overall assessment is that they are about the same, with Applicant having \none foot in the United States and one foot in the country of her foreign citizenship.  \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Israeli government or her family members who \nhave Israeli citizenship, reside in Israel, or both. I also cannot conclude there is no \nconflict of interest within the meaning of AG \u00b6 8(b). The substantial financial interests in \nIsrael are also worrisome. The three mitigating conditions noted above, in light of the \nevidence as a whole, do not apply to mitigate the foreign influence security concern. \nConcerning the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1, the issue under Guideline C for foreign \npreference is whether Applicant\u2019s actions are such as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States. Note, Department Counsel did not address the \nforeign preference matters in the argument section of his written brief. The overall \nconcern is set forth in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then [they] may provide information \nor make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nForeign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. national \ninterests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a \nU.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying without \nan objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. The \nsame is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of foreign \ncitizenship and any action to acquire or obtained recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 10(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \nand \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: (1) \nassuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or \npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization; and (2) \notherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests. \nOf the four allegations made in SOR \u00b6 1, only Applicant\u2019s military service in the \nIDF raises a concern. It falls squarely within the meaning of the disqualifying condition \nat AG \u00b6 10(d)(1). The remaining three SOR allegations are addressed below. \nFirst, while it\u2019s undisputed that Applicant acquired Israeli citizen as a native-born \ncitizen, she did so when she was a minor child under the control and influence of her \nparents. It was a matter wholly beyond her control. Given these circumstances, her \nacquisition of Israeli citizenship cannot reasonably qualify as an intentional, deliberate, \nor purposeful act on her part; she was a passive participate in the process. Accordingly, \nthe disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 10(a) does not apply here. \nSecond, Applicant\u2019s employment history in Israel working for software companies \nbetween 1992 and 2011, as a programmer, team leader, and only later as a product \nmanager, starting around 2008, does not raise a concern. It does not fall within the \nmeaning of AG \u00b6 10(d)(1), because it was not employment with or a position in a foreign \ngovernment or military organization. \nThird, Applicant\u2019s voting in an Israeli election in about January 2013 does not \nraise a concern. Voting in a foreign election does not fall within the meaning of AG \u00b6 \n10(d). Note, the previous August 2006 version of Guideline C specifically included \nvoting in a foreign election as a disqualifying condition. But voting in a foreign election \nwas not included in the list of disqualifying conditions when the most recent version of \nGuideline C was issued in December 2016. \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \npreference concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 11(d) the exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations or foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual because a U.S. citizen; and \nAG \u00b6 11(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. \nlaw, or the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required \nby U.S. law. \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 11(d) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service in the IDF, a mandatory obligation in Israel, occurred while she was an \nadult dual citizen of the United States and Israel. Likewise, there is no evidence in the \nwritten record to support application of AG \u00b6 11(g). I also note that Applicant served in \nthe IDF for four years, and she was trained and worked in the field of military \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintelligence. She also has several family members, including her husband, her son, her \ndaughter, and her stepdaughter who have served in the IDF, which is probably common \nfor Israeli families given the mandatory obligation to perform military service. Her \nmilitary service occurred more than 30 years ago during 1985-1989, when she was a \nyoung adult, and there has been substantial passage of time. Still, when viewing her \nmilitary service not in isolation but as part of the whole of this case, I cannot conclude \nthat Applicant has met her burden of proof to establish mitigation. \nOne final matter. Applicant has argued that none of the reasons in the SOR \nindicate anything beyond expected behavior and circumstances of any person \nimmigrating to the United States from another country, and that she has no reason for \ndisloyalty to the country of her birth. (Answer to SOR) As to the first point, which is a fair \npoint to make, that does not mean the U.S. Government may not consider the expected \nbehavior and circumstances of such a person when deciding whether to grant such a \nperson the privilege of a security clearance. As to the second point, it is a long-standing \nrule that security clearance decisions are not a loyalty determination or test. Section 7 of \nthe 1960 Eisenhower Executive Order (E.O. 10865) provides that an unfavorable \nclearance decision \u201cshall be a determination in the terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she \nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

On October 21, 2020, \nhe was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). During that interview, after again denying any financial issues, he was confronted \nwith information concerning several delinquent accounts. He subsequently described his \ndelinquent accounts and claimed that two factors contributed to his financial difficulties: \nhe was immature and he became ill in 2016 and got behind on his bills. (Item 4 at 5-9) \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,727, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $13,473 that \nwas placed for collection and charged off. Although Applicant claimed to be making \npayments on his unspecified debt, he offered no documentation associated with this \nparticular account. (Item 5 at 7; Item 4 at 8-9) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $718 that was \nplaced for collection.

(Item 5 at 8; Item 4 at 5) The \naccount has not been resolved. \nApplicant contended to the OPM Investigator that his overall financial situation is \ngood and that he is making payments on his past due debt as needed to repair his credit \nand become more financially independent. Nevertheless, as noted above, he submitted \nno documentation such as payment plans, statements from his creditors, cancelled \nchecks, or other items that might support his contentions that his delinquent debts were \nbeing addressed. There is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to \ndescribe with any specificity his current financial situation. Applicant did not report his net \nmonthly income, his monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments (for \neven the most insignificant of his delinquent debts). In the absence of such information, I \nam unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or \nspending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems are now \nunder control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been. \nPersonal Conduct  \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86 on September 24, 2020, in response to two \nspecific questions in Section 26 \u2013 Financial Record Delinquency Involving Routine \nAccounts: in the past seven years have you had: bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency; or have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled \nfor failing to pay as agreed? Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions, when, in fact, his \nresponse was not true. At that time, he had nine still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $24,727, including at least one repossessed automobile. Applicant\u2019s \nsomewhat flippant explanation that he could not remember every single detail of his life \nfor the past ten years, especially concerning \u201cgeneral bills that everybody has,\u201d fails to \naddress the allegation. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,727. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to two \nfactors: he was immature and he became ill in 2016 and got behind on his bills. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been \nunwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. Applicant has \nacknowledged a history of financial difficulties going back at least to 2016 when he was \nill. He never described the illness or indicated in what ways it impacted his ability to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status. Moreover, other than a general statement about \nmaking payments on his unspecified debt, Applicant failed to specifically claim that he \ncontacted any creditors or made any verifiable payments in an effort to resolve his debts.  \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Between the date he was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in October 2020 and the date his response to the FORM was expected in \nApril 2022, he made no claimed or verifiable efforts to address any of the delinquent \ndebts. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. Because of his failure to confirm payment of \neven his smallest delinquent account (a medical bill for $51) and his failure to furnish \ndocumentation regarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the \nconclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts \nof working with his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a \nsituation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 20/18); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making such efforts. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered no specifics \nregarding any past or proposed repayment efforts; submitted no documentary evidence \nto reflect any payments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one \ndelinquent debt has been resolved. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts.

Oct. 6, 2010). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s financial considerations are adopted herein. \nWith respect to the alleged omission, concealment, or falsification on September 24, \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain questions pertaining \nto his financial record (concerning delinquent debts, collection activities, credit card \nsuspensions, etc.). He answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions. He certified that the responses \nwere \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but the \nresponses to those questions were, in fact, incorrect for at that time Applicant had several \naccounts that fell within the stated parameters. As noted above, in his somewhat flippant \nAnswer to the SOR, he simply stated that he could not remember every single detail of \nhis life for the past ten years, especially concerning \u201cgeneral bills that everybody has.\u201d He \ndid not specifically claim that his false responses to the SF 86 questions were due to \noversight or mistake.  \nApplicant\u2019s responses provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions \nwere deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of \nmisunderstanding of the true facts. I have considered the very limited available \ninformation pertaining to Appellant\u2019s background and professional career in analyzing his \nactions. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative \njudge, I must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct \nor circumstantial evidence concerning Appellant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nfalsification or omission occurred. The Appeal Board has explained the process for \nanalyzing falsification cases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \nWhile Applicant might not be able to remember every single detail of his life for the \npast ten years, including \u201cgeneral bills that everybody has,\u201d it is clear that he should have \nbeen aware of his delinquent accounts, including his repossessed vehicle, all of which \noccurred within four years of his submission of his certified SF 86. His eventual \nacknowledgment as to his financial record is unambiguous (he knew the accounts \nexisted, but he was working towards paying them off at the time). AG \u00b6 16(a) has been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.  \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s financial record response was made on September 24, 2020, the \nissues related to his finances continue to this day. Other than finding it offensive that he \nhas been alleged to be a liar, Applicant has still failed to explain why he chose not to \ncandidly report his delinquent accounts when he completed his SF 86. Applicant\u2019s actions \nunder the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(a) has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \ninspector since he was employed in January 2019. He was previously employed by \nanother employer as a painter from February 2018 until December 2018. He received \neither his high school diploma or a certification from a vocational, technical, or trade \nschool in 2001. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has nine still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $24,727. He attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current \nstatus to two factors: he was immature, and he became ill in 2016 and got behind on his \nbills. There is no indication that he was out of work or what the actual impact his health \nhad on him or his ability to keep those accounts current. Other than a general statement \nabout making payments on his unspecified debt, Applicant failed to specifically claim that \nhe contacted any creditors or made any verifiable payments in an effort to resolve his \ndebts. When answering financial questions on his SF 86, he denied having any financial \ndifficulties, although at that time he had nine delinquent accounts, including one for a \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmotor vehicle that had been previously repossessed. There are lingering questions if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, \nthe lengthy period of non-contact with his creditors, and his failure to be candid about his \ndelinquent debts when he completed the SF 86, is negative and disappointing. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal \nconduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and hearing testimony, \nApplicant mitigated alcohol consumption and personal conduct concerns.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

(GEs 1-5) Applicant relied on \nsix exhibits (AEs A-F) and five witnesses (including himself). The transcript was \nreceived on March 10, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the opening of the hearing, the Government filed a motion in limine to \nrestrict Applicant\u2019s substance abuse counselor from testifying on matters exceeding the \nscope of her stated expertise. (HE 1) After evaluating Applicant\u2019s hearing exhibit (AE \nD), and hearing argument from the parties, the Government\u2019s motion was granted \ntentatively, subject to further assessments of weight to assign the counselor\u2019s report \nonce the report was offered in evidence by Applicant and the Government had \nopportunity to respond and offer objections. (Tr. 15-17)  \nBefore the closing of the hearing, the parties were afforded opportunities to \nsupplement their oral closings with written closings. Written closings were not filed by \neither party. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly: (a) was arrested and charged in June \n2017 with battery resulting in bodily injury in which alcohol was involved; (b) was \narrested in September 2014 and charged with disorderly conduct-fighting in which \nalcohol was involved, and was found guilty; (c) was arrested in December 2011 and \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI), driving while ability impaired, DUI per se, \nand speeding; (d) arrested in July 2006 and charged with DUI and sodomy \nsolicitation/solicitation under 17 years of age; and (e) received non-judicial punishment \n(NJP) in March 2002, under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) \nfor the offense of disobeying a lawful order in which alcohol was involved \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) was arrested in about August 2006 \nand charged with driving on a license suspended or revoked and (b) was arrested in \nAugust 2006 and charged with driving on a suspended or revoked license, for which he \npled no contest and received 12 months of probation and $812 in fines. Cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E are the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.f -1.g. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations of the \nSOR with explanations and clarifications.

(GEs 2-3) At the time, he was experiencing a good \ndeal of stress attributable to his being in Army training and away from his wife and \nyoung daughter. (Tr. 146-147) \nAppearing in court on the 2011 charges, Applicant pled guilty to a lesser charge \nof driving while intoxicated.

(AE \nC; Tr. 172-174) Applicant\u2019s one-on-one counseling sessions did not require diagnosis \nsessions with his counselor and consisted of working on coping strategies and skill \nbuilding. Applicant was credited with satisfactory progress during both episodes of \ncounseling. (AE C) \nIn September 2021, Applicant retained the counseling services of a licensed \nsubstance abuse counseling group. (AE D) In his one-on-one counseling session with \nthe lead counselor of the group (Ms. A), Applicant was credited with providing relevant \nand truthful background information about his prior arrests and charges. Upon obtaining \nbackground information from Applicant, Ms. A supplemented Applicant\u2019s furnished \nalcohol history with her administering of standardized tests, relying principally on the \nMichigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST), the Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT), the \nEleven Point Criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder covered in the Diagnostic Statistical \nManual-5 (DSM-5), and a comprehensive biopsychosocial process. (AE D) \nAdditionally, Ms. A reviewed the Government\u2019s SOR. Following her review of the \nSOR allegation, her evaluations of Applicant\u2019s supplied background information, her \nresults of her administered tests, and Applicant\u2019s responses to her questions about \nlessons learned, Ms. A found no evidence of an alcohol use disorder. (AE D) Her \nfindings are weakened somewhat, however, by her reliance on an ICD-10-CM Code \nF10.929, which is a billing code for alcohol use disorder, and is not DSM-V-based \ncriterion for ruling out an alcohol use disorder. \nWhile Ms. A\u2019s credentials were not questioned by the Government, her \nassessments and opinions were challenged by Department Counsel on multiple \ngrounds. (Tr. 30) Cited reasons for assigning no weight to her assessments and \nopinions were as follows: Her opinions exceeded her reported expertise and invaded \n\u201cthe province of the factfinder;\u201d and her misrepresentations and misstatements about \nApplicant\u2019s diagnoses were based in part on a mistaken understanding and reliance on \nthe DSM-V criteria for identifying alcohol abuse disorders. (Tr. 30) Over the \nGovernment\u2019s objections, Ms. A\u2019s substance abuse evaluation was admitted for the \nweight warranted after a full consideration of her credentials and the furnished \ninformation she relied on in assigning a no alcohol abuse diagnosis and safe prognosis \nfor avoiding any future alcohol abuse. (AE D) \nSummarized, while Ms. A\u2019s no alcohol use disorder diagnosis is entitled to some \nweight, limitations are placed on her assessment based on her misapplication of the \ncriteria used in the DSM-V for making an overall assessment and treatment prognosis. \n(AE D) The substance abuse counselor\u2019s use of the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the Directive to reinforce her professional assessments of Applicant\u2019s risks \nof recurrence address ultimate questions of security clearance eligibility and perforce \nexceed the scope of her developed expertise. While Ms. A certainly retained the \nprofessional qualifications and authority (both as to academic training and experience) \nto make ultimate assessments of Applicant\u2019s recurrence risks based on her overall \nevaluation of Applicant\u2019s alcohol history, testing results, and her own professional \ntraining and experience, she was not qualified to make ultimate judgments as to \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.

All of \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors, colleagues, past and present, and friends believe that Applicant \npossesses the level of honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment requisite for \nholding a position of trust. \nApplicant earned many awards recognizing his contributions during his Army \ncareer. (AE F; Tr. 134-136) His awards include an earned Bronze Star Medal \nrecognizing his exceptionally valorous achievement during Operation Iraqi Freedom. \n(AE F) Other awards earned by Applicant include Good Conduct Medals, Army \nCommendation Medals, Army Achievement Medals, Ranger Course Completion \ndiplomas, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and certificates associated with Special \nForces training and qualifications courses.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. The AGs list guidelines to be considered \nby judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines \ntake into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the \nindividual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nAlcohol Consumption \n7 \n   The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the \nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 21. \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n         \nPersonal Conduct \n  \nThe Concern: \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

So, too, his retained substance abuse counselor (Ms. \nA) in 2021 found no evidence of alcohol abuse disorder after considering his alcohol-\nrelated arrests and testing results, and exercising her training and experience.

His corrective actions include \ncounseling, exhibited increased maturity, and reduction in the amount of alcohol he \nconsumes. \nBased on the demonstrated corrective actions, Applicant has taken since his last \nalcohol-related incident in 2017, he is entitled to the mitigating benefits of two mitigating \nconditions (MCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline. MCs \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time \nhas passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges \nhis or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d \napply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nCross-alleged under Guideline E are Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents. Added \nmisdemeanor traffic-related offenses under this Guideline that do not include an alcohol \ncomponent are Applicant\u2019s two incidents in 2006 involving driving with a suspended or \nrevoked driver\u2019s license. These two incidents by themselves raise security concerns \nover Applicant\u2019s driving habits. When considered together with Applicant\u2019s five alcohol-\nrelated incidents covered by Guideline G, the two traffic-related incidents, while \ncondensed over a brief two-month period in 2017, share a common thread of security \nconcerns over questionable exercises in judgment.

In ISCR Case No. 03-08475 at 5-8 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, \n2007), the applicant accumulated seven traffic-related offenses and one DUI offense. \nSimilar to the array of offenses cited in this case, the traffic-related offenses considered \nin ISCR Case No. 03-08475 were comprised of speeding, license plate offenses, \ndisobeying road signs, driving with a suspended license, and a DUI. \nLike the traffic-related instances cited in ISCR Case No. 03-08475, the two cited \ntraffic-related incidents cited in Applicant\u2019s case individually could be expected to fall \ninto minor categories if assessed individually. Because they are intertwined with \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses, they must be considered contextually as a part of \nan overall pattern of judgment lapses. \nMitigating conditions have applicability to the facts of this case. In recognition of \nhis improved understanding of the importance of adhering to safe driving rules and the \nuse of prudent restraints in driving and social situations, Applicant\u2019s recognition of his \nneed to find counseling assistance to help him overcome the stressors associated with \nhis divorce and his unstable relationship with his mother, and his evidenced maturity in \nhis current employment practices and relationships, application of MC \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d is fully available to Applicant. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of alcohol-related arrests, mixed with two traffic-\nrelated misdemeanor offenses and convictions are incompatible with his holding a \nsecurity clearance. Considering his civilian contributions to the defense industry and the \ncorrective steps he has taken to avoid future recurrences of misjudgments (implicit (in \nhis alcohol-related and traffic offenses) Applicant is able to surmount his judgment \nlapses of the past and restore his eligibility to hold a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s defense contributions, weighed together with his mitigation efforts, \nare enough to overcome his alcohol abuse history. I have carefully applied the law, as \nset forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) However, he denied intentionally falsifying information on his August 2019 security clearance application (SCA), which essentially constitutes a denial of SOR \u00b6 1.a and will be treated as such. His admissions are incorporated as a finding of facts. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at his present job in August 2019. He is currently a senior engineer. He has an associate degree and is a few hours shy of obtaining his bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2005 and served on active duty until 2017 when he separated with an honorable discharge. In 2019, he was placed on the Marine Corps permanent disability retired list with a disability rating of 30 percent. He served two combat deployments as a tank crewman to Iraq in 2007, and Afghanistan in 2011.

He receives a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \ndisability pension of approximately $2,400 monthly based upon a 90 percent disability \nrating.

The Government\u2019s evidence included documents showing that in January \n2008, Applicant was issued a letter of intent to revoke his security clearance and a final \nrevocation letter was issued to Applicant in June 2008. Applicant testified that he was \naware of the 2008 revocation at the time he completed his August 2019 SCA. His \nexplanation for answering \u201cno\u201d to the question was he thought the question was only \nasking him about whether he had a revocation within the last ten years.

(Tr. 25-26, 40, 42-43; GE 1-2, 4-5) \nDuring his background interview in November 2019, he was again asked by the \ninvestigator about whether he had previously had his security clearance revoked and he \nagain denied it. He was then confronted with the previous revocation information and he \nclaimed he did not recall the incident. (the November 2019 false statement to the \ninvestigator is not alleged in the SOR and I will not consider that information for \ndisqualification purposes, however, I may consider it to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in \ndetermining the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in considering the whole-\nperson factors) (Tr. 25-26, 40, 42-43; GE 1-2, 4-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: In 2019, Applicant was employed by a state agency as a drug \ntechnician. In April 2019, he attended an out-of-town three-day training opportunity with \nother coworkers. They stayed at a hotel while attending the training. At the hotel, \nApplicant was given a room with a male roommate. On one of the days after the training \nsession, Applicant went out for drinks with a female coworker. They eventually went to \nApplicant\u2019s room where they engaged in sexual relations. Applicant\u2019s roommate was \npresent when this occurred. Applicant\u2019s actions came to the attention of his superiors \nand he admitted his conduct. He was fired from his position. (Tr. 27-28, 54-55, 70; GE \n1-2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant admitted that he lied to his wife about the reason for his \nApril 2019 firing. He told his wife that he was fired because during the training he got \ndrunk and belligerent. He continued with the lie until February 2021 when he claimed \nthat he told her the truth about why he was fired. He waited so long to tell the truth \nbecause he was afraid he would lose his family if he did so. His wife provided an \naffidavit in support of him. His current supervisors are unaware of this incident. (Tr. 28, \n55, 58, 62; GE 2; AE J) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: In June 2018, Applicant was working as an intern at a state agency. \nAs part of his training he and other employees took a knowledge test.

Therefore, I will find in favor of Applicant concerning SOR \u00b6 1.e because it \ndescribed the administrative consequences that Applicant received as a result of the \nunderlying actions described by SOR \u00b6 1.f. In 2015, when Applicant was still enlisted in \nthe Marine Corps, he had a two-month adulterous affair with another Marine. He was \nphysically separated from his wife at the time. In order to deceive both his command \nand his wife, he created false medical records to show that he was hospitalized over a \ncertain timeframe. In actuality, he was spending that time with the Marine with whom he \nwas having an affair. Applicant\u2019s deceitful action was discovered and he was confronted \nby his command about it on two occasions. He continued to deny any wrongdoing. He \nfinally admitted his deceitful and illegal actions when he accepted NJP from his \ncommand in February 2015. (Tr. 45-46, 49; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that after his 2015 adulterous affair, he and his wife attended \ncouples\u2019 therapy for about a year. He stated that he told his wife about the affair after \nthey started the therapy. He also testified that he had some individual therapy in 2017 \nfor about one year. He became aware of his PTSD in 2018. (Tr. 50-51, 63-64) \nApplicant testified that he and his wife starting attending a couples\u2019 therapy \nworkshop in October 2021. He presented documentation showing the virtual sessions \nwith a VA Chaplain. He claimed that he and his wife are continuing with these \nworkshops. He also testified that he began attending individual therapy through the VA \nin February 2021. He has weekly sessions with a therapist and talks with a psychiatrist \nevery few months to regulate his medication for PTSD. He related that his PTSD arises \nfrom several events he witnessed during his combat deployments. These events \nincluded witnessing death and injury to fellow Marines and local children. He claimed \nthat because of this recent therapy and being on medication, he is a changed person \nand he will not engage in similar bad behavior in the future. He also has better \ncommunication lines with his wife. (Tr. 28-30,36-37, 66, 72; AE C) \nApplicant received numerous awards and decorations for his Marine Corps \nservice, including a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, two Good Conduct \nMedals, and a Combat Action Ribbon. His 2021 work appraisal indicated that he \u201cmeets \nexpectations\u201d in all categories. He has received acknowledgments by his employer for \nhis contributions to the company\u2019s overall mission. (AE E-H) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant \u2018s explanation that he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about whether he \never had a security clearance revoked because he missed the word ever and thought it \nwas asking only about the last 10 years is not credible given his age, experience, and \nthe plain language of the question. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe established facts concerning the remaining allegations all demonstrate \nApplicant\u2019s questionable judgment, unreliability, lack of candor, and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. In 2015 he lied and deceived his wife and the Marine \nCorps about having an affair with another Marine. In 2018 he failed to follow his \nemployer\u2019s rules and compromised a test-taking situation that resulted in his \ntermination. In April 2019, he once again showed poor judgment by having sex with a \ncoworker during a training conference, which resulted in his termination. He then lied to \nhis wife as to the reason for his firing and continued to conceal the truth from her for \nalmost two years. His current chain of command is unaware of his past deceitful \nconduct. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Appellant\u2019s conduct as to SOR \n\u00b6 1.f is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. \nHowever, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple incidents of failing to follow his employer\u2019s rules (e.g., the Marine \nCorps and two state agencies) and his numerous occasions of lying and engaging in \ndeceitful conduct make both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) applicable. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \nApplicant actions were not minor nor infrequent. Insufficient time has passed to \ndetermine if Applicant has changed his behavior. While there is some evidence that \nApplicant acknowledged his bad behavior and has received some counseling, there is \ninsufficient evidence to determine that the circumstances contributing to his \nuntrustworthy and unreliable behavior no longer exist, or that such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. This is particularly true since there are no treatment records to document his \nclinical progress related to PTSD. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. While Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinally told his wife the truth concerning both the 2015 adultery and the 2019 adultery \nand firing, his prolonged delay in each case placed him in a position of vulnerability. AG \n\u00b6 17(e) has minimal application. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his multiple combat \ndeployments, his awards and decorations, his VA disability rating, his civilian job \nappraisal and other recognition, and his family situation. However, I also considered that \nhe lied, deceived, and failed to follow established rules on multiple occasions. He also \nengaged in attempts to cover-up his actions. Additionally, he deliberately falsified \nmaterial information on his 2019 SCA. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.e: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph:   1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was required to register as a sex offender. SOR \u00b6 2.a cross alleges the same \ninformation as in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant admitted that he was convicted and sentenced as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a; \nhowever, he asserted he was factually innocent of the charge of Attempted Enticement \nof Child by Adult because he believed the alleged victim, Kiki (not her actual name), was \nover the age of 18. The age of a child in the State statute is defined as being under the \nage of 15 years. The person Applicant attempted to entice for sex was an undercover \npolice officer posing as a child. \nThe police report states that Applicant viewed Kiki\u2019s profile on the Internet, and her \nprofile indicates she is 12 years old.1  Applicant looked for her picture on her profile, but \nclaimed he did not notice her age on the profile. (Tr. 67; GE 5 at 18) There was no picture \non her profile. On October 28, 2007, Applicant contacted Kiki, who informed him that she \nwas 12 years old. After she sent him a picture of her face, Applicant said she looked like \nshe was 18 years old, and Kiki responded that she is 12 and will be 13 in March.2  (GE 5 \nat 14; AE SS at .pdf 44) Applicant told Kiki that she was 18 years old, and Kiki agreed \nwith him. Id. at .pdf 17, 44. The police officer posing as Kiki \u201crepeated several more times \nthroughout the chat that [Kiki] was twelve-years-old.\u201d (GE 5 at 15) Applicant told Kiki that \nhe could see her as long as she is 18 years old, and Kiki responded \u201c12 going on 18, \nright.\u201d (AE SS at 19, 44) Applicant responded \u201cEighteen right? So if [you\u2019re] eighteen, \nwould, could have all kinds of fun.\u201d (Id.) Kiki responded \u201cYep.\u201d (Id.) Applicant said, \u201cIs that \nwhat you want?\u201d, and Kiki said, \u201cYep.\u201d (Id.)  \nApplicant said Kiki was gorgeous and asked if she liked older men. He asked for \npictures of her, and he called her again on October 29, 2007. The State appellate court \nreviewing the case for factual sufficiency noted, \u201cWhen [Applicant] talked about sexual \nintercourse with [Kiki], she expressed concern that he would tell her mother and she would \nget into trouble. Such references could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that \n[Applicant] believed he was communicating with a twelve-year-old girl.\u201d (GE 5 at 15) \nApplicant agreed over the telephone to meet Kiki at a bowling alley. When the \npolice arrested Applicant, they asked him why he was at the bowling alley, and he \nresponded, \u201cI think you know why I am here.\u201d3 When the police officer asked him if he \nwas there to meet Kiki for sex, he responded by nodding his head up and down and \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the information in this paragraph and the next paragraph is from the police report \npertaining to Applicant\u2019s arrest on October 29, 2007. (GE 4 at 6) Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8), \n\u201ccourt records and police reports, are presumed to be reliable by virtue of the government agency\u2019s duty \nfor accuracy and the high probability that it has satisfied that duty.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03603 at 4 (citing \nUnited States v.

Of course, the documents can still be challenged for accuracy, and other reasons, and such \nchallenges go to their weight not their admissibility. \n2 Applicant agreed that the police report in this instance accurately reflected his question and her response. \n(Tr. 66-67) \n3 Applicant agreed that the police report accurately reflected his conversation with the police when he was \narrested, except for the part about his disclosure that he had condoms in his vehicle.

(Tr. 61-62) He met Kiki in an adult chat \nroom. (Tr. 51) He said Kiki sent him a picture, and she looked like she was 26 to 28 years \nold. (Tr. 53) They discussed oral sex, and he believed this conversation was an indication \nKiki was over 18. (Tr. 68) For example, he asked her if she ever swallowed semen \nbecause he suspected she was lying to him. (Tr. 68) He said he sent her a picture of his \npenis and asked her to send pictures of her genitals once he was convinced she was over \nthe age of 18 because he was upset that she was lying to him. (Tr. 69-70; GE 5 at 17) He \nsaid he believed she was over the age of 18. (Tr. 64) The first phone call was brief \nbecause she said her mom was coming. (Tr. 53) He said she gave her age as 12, 13, 14, \nand 15. (Tr. 53) He did not cite a page in the record of chats showing she said she was \n15. He pursued the relationship because he was curious and wanted to \u201cfigure out who \n[she] was.\u201d (Tr. 54) He said that when he got to the bowling alley, he received a phone \ncall and he asked her \u201cI just want to confirm you\u2019re over 18, correct?\u201d (Tr. 54) He claimed \nthat she replied \u201cyes\u201d and hung up the phone. (Tr. 54) Seconds later the police arrested \nhim. (Tr. 54) \nApplicant was convicted by a jury, contrary to his pleas, of Attempted Enticement \nof a Child, a felony, and sentenced by the judge to five years in prison. (Tr. 50, 59) To \nestablish Attempted Enticement of a Child, \u201cthe State was required to prove [Applicant] \ntook a substantial step towards enticing [Kiki] for the purpose of engaging in sexual \nconduct with her.\u201d (GE 5 at 17) He was acquitted of Furnishing Pornographic Material to \na Minor (Tr. 50), possibly because the police officer who was posing was a child was not \na minor. He did not testify at his trial based on advice of his counsel. (Tr. 55-56) He \nappealed his conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel, instructional error, \nfactual sufficiency, and other issues. (Tr. 56; GE 5 at 14) He provided statements from \nexperts on sex offenses, chat rooms, and people posing as others on the Internet. (AE \nSS) He also provided evidence from mental-health practitioners about pedophilia. (AE \nSS) The State appellate court addressed several allegations of error, and concluded, \u201cthe \nState was not required to prove that [Applicant] knew or reasonably believed that [Kiki] \nwas under the age of fifteen.\u201d (GE 5 at 14) Nevertheless, \u201cIf the instruction had required \nthe jury to find that [Applicant] knew, or reasonably believed, that the person he was \ncommunicating with was younger than fifteen, there was ample evidence for the jury to \nmake that finding. [Applicant] was therefore not prejudiced by the omission of that \nrequirement, even if it was an element of the offense.\u201d Id. at 15. \nThe State appellate court noted that the jury could infer that Applicant believed he \nwas communicating with a 12-year-old girl because of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued requests to have [Kiki] state that she was eighteen, his \nacknowledgement on at least one occasion that she had stated her age as \nyounger than eighteen, his concerns about [Kiki] being an undercover \nofficer, his attempt to leave the bowling alley when police officers \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napproached his car, and by his statements made after he was arrested that \nevidenced a consciousness that he had been caught engaging in illegal \nactivity.

(Tr. 57) He denied that he had other \ninstances where he sex-related conversations with minors. (Tr. 78) \nThe State appellate court addressed several assignments of error, including a \nclaim the evidence was insufficient to prove that Applicant is guilty of Attempted \nEnticement of a Child. The State appellate court assessed the evidence \u201cin the light most \nfavorable to the verdict,\u201d concluded that evidence showed Applicant believed he was \ncommunicating with a child under the age of 15, and denied Applicant\u2019s appeal. (GE 5 at \n6, 19) Next, Applicant filed for habeas relief as he was incarcerated. A U.S. magistrate \nwrote a memorandum on behalf of a U.S. district court, reviewed the case \u201cin the light \nmost favorable to the verdict,\u201d agreed with the State appellate court\u2019s discussion of \nknowledge of the age of the victim, and denied his writ of habeas corpus. (AE SS at 127, \n141-142, 192) \nDr. David W. Cline is board certified in psychiatry and neurology and a retired Army \ncolonel with service in Desert Shield and Storm.

(Tr. 18; AE X; AE QQ; AE RR) He reviewed Applicant\u2019s exhibits, the \nSOR, the record of trial, medical and psychiatric records, and he interviewed Applicant \nfour times. (Tr. 20-21, 28; AE X at 1-2) He did not interview Applicant after 2017, and he \ndid not review the police reports concerning Applicant\u2019s arrest in October 2007. (Tr. 28, \n32) \nApplicant told Dr. Cline that he was suspicious that Kiki was not really a 12-year-\nold, and the reason he communicated with her was \u201cto expose her to the fact that she \nwas misrepresenting herself.\u201d (Tr. 36) He is or was a curious person, and he wanted to \nconfront her about the truth about being \u201cso knowledgeable about adult life and adult \nsexual behavior that she is trying to harass [him] or pull [him] into this.\u201d (Tr. 26, 45) He \nplanned to see an adult woman later the evening he was arrested. (Tr. 37)   \nDr. Cline concluded that Applicant is credible and truthful. (Tr. 24) Applicant \u201cdid \nnot have evil intent towards performing sexual activity with a 12-year-old girl.\u201d (Tr. 21; AE \nX) He did not believe the person he was meeting was a child. (Tr. 21; AE X) He concluded \nApplicant was really not guilty of the charge of enticement of a child. (Tr. 24) In 2017, Dr. \nCline diagnosed Applicant as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \nanxiety, and depression. Applicant described \u201cfive distinctive near-death experiences\u201d \nthat could have been the source of his PTSD while Applicant was in the Air Force: (1) a \nplane crash landing in which Applicant was not injured and one person received a head \ninjury; (2) one of his subordinates discovered an unexploded mine in Bosnia; (3) Applicant \nwas in the vicinity of an explosion which killed one person and injured another in Bosnia; \n(4) a plane crash in his vicinity in Bosnia resulted in a death, and (5) someone discovered \nan unexploded roadside bomb in Bosnia.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

Almost fifteen years have elapsed without evidence of recurrence of criminal \nactivity. He complied with the terms of his confinement, and he registered as a sex \noffender. He received job training, obtained higher education, and has an excellent \nemployment record. \nThe findings of the State trial court, State appellate court, and U.S. district court \nconcerning Appellant\u2019s commission of the offense of Enticement of Child by Adult are not \nbinding on my security clearance determination. I had evidence available to me that the \ntrial court did not have, such as Applicant\u2019s statement, and statements of subject matter \nexperts and mental-health experts. Applicant\u2019s appellate briefs discussed how his trial \nattorney failed to make objections, failed to ask for a mistrial, and failed to present \nexculpatory evidence from expert witnesses.

I independently considered \nall relevant evidence the Government and Applicant presented, and then made my own \ncredibility determination.   \nAfter careful assessment of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, I conclude there is \nsubstantial reliable evidence of record that in October 2007, Applicant committed the \noffense of Attempted Enticement of Child by Adult. He attempted to entice Kiki to engage \nin a sex act with him. I am satisfied that Applicant believed Kiki was under the age of 15 \nwhen he solicited her to join him at the bowling alley, and he intended to have sex with \nher. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI am not persuaded that Applicant believed Kiki was 15 years old or older. His \nclaimed goal to unmask her or to discover why she was falsely claiming that she was 12 \nor 13 years old is not credible. Because he was not truthful at his hearing about his mental \nstate in October 2007 when he committed the offense, Applicant has not successfully \nrehabilitated himself. ISCR Case No. 20-01577 at 3 (App. Bd. June 6, 2022) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (listing the purposes for which non-\nalleged conduct can be considered)). \nWhile his offense in October 2007 is not recent, Applicant\u2019s lack of rehabilitation \nas shown by his false statement at his hearing shows lack of rehabilitation and continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nSexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the security concern arising from sexual behavior as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that in October 2007, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Enticement of Child by Adult and Furnishing \nPornographic Material to a Minor. In February 2012, he was convicted of Attempted \nEnticement of a Child, a felony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) are established, and \nconsideration of the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant presented some mitigating information and AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), \nand 14(e) partially apply. The sexual offense in October 2007 occurred on a single \noccasion and is infrequent. There is no evidence that he has sought sex from \nminors in almost 15 years, and the offense is not recent. He received some \ncounseling, and Dr. Cline provided a favorable prognosis when he predicted \nApplicant would not commit future sexual offenses. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. As indicated in the \nCriminal Conduct section, supra, Applicant was not truthful about his conduct at \nhis hearing, and he is not rehabilitated. His felonious sexual offense in October \n2007 and his false denial of the requisite belief that Kiki was a child continue to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Sexual behavior \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines J and \nD are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old senior strategic manager employed by a defense \ncontractor. He provided a detailed resume of his employment history and \naccomplishments. In 1992, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and electrical \nengineering. In 2004, he received a master\u2019s degree in telecommunications management, \nand he is currently seeking a master\u2019s degree in business administration. He received \nseveral work-related technical certifications. He served in Bosnia and Herzegovina from \n1995 to 1997. He served in the Air Force for six years on active duty and for two years in \nthe inactive Reserve. He received an honorable discharge as a captain in 2001. Some of \nhis Air Force experiences caused him to have PTSD. \nApplicant received excellent performance evaluations while serving in the Air \nForce and working for a government contractor. He received a Joint Service \nCommendation Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and NATO Medal for service \nin Operation Endeavor. He received cash bonuses and increases in pay from 2018 \nthrough 2021. The general sense of his 11 letters of recommendation is that Applicant \nshows professionalism, honesty, integrity, sincerity, trustworthiness, diligence, reliability, \nand humility. He is thoughtful, patriotic, courteous, and gracious. Their letters support \napproval of his access to classified information. Applicant described himself as a true \npatriot, who tries to do the right thing, loves his country, and has risked his life for his \ncountry. He wants to continue to contribute to the success of his company in supporting \nthe DOD. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more convincing. In October 2007, Applicant \nattempted to entice a police officer posing as a 12-year-old child into committing a sex \nact. He was convicted of a felony; he was incarcerated for five years; and he is a \nregistered sex offender. He falsely denied that he believed Kiki was a child and instead \nclaimed he believed she was 18 years old or older when he solicited a sex act from her. \nAt his personal appearance, he exhibited no remorse or insight into his past behavior.

On December 22, 2021, the DE extended \nthe student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes the following \nrelief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and \nstopped collections on defaulted loans.

In 2018, Applicant \npurchased a vehicle and made a $500 down payment. (Tr. 47) He financed $31,500. (Tr. \n47) In 2019, he had the vehicle voluntarily repossessed because he could not afford the \ncar payments and vehicle-related expenses. (Tr. 49) Correspondence from the creditor \nwas sent to his parent\u2019s residence and then lost. (Tr. 53-54) The debt was sent to \ncollections when the creditor did not hear from Applicant. (Tr. 53-54) In May 2019, \nApplicant entered into a payment plan with the creditor, and he made $150 to $200 \nmonthly payments every month from June 2019 to present. (Tr. 46-50; AE B) On February \n26, 2022, the creditor wrote that all payments were made on the payment plan and the \ndebt is current. (AE B) \nApplicant paid off one non-SOR telecommunications debt. (AE E) His most recent \ncredit report of record does not contain any non-SOR delinquent debts.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe relevant financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 in this \ncase are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n \nApplicant was underemployed and had relatively brief periods of unemployment. \nHis student loans went to collections. His vehicle was repossessed. He had two additional \ndelinquent debts. He acted reasonably under the circumstances because once he \nreceived better-paying employment, he paid, brought to current status, or established \npayment plans for all of his SOR debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTwo Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) when an Applicant lacks the income to address debts. In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the Applicant had $41,871 in delinquent credit card debt and \ndefaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That Applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at \n1-2. The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)\u201d even though that Applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board \nalso decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. It is noteworthy that Applicant has the burden of proving the \napplicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition \nnever shifts to the Government. \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed a situation where an Applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the \nability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted \u201cit will be a long time at best before \nhe has paid\u201d all of his creditors. Id. at 3. That Applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan. \n \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 07-06482 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)). The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 used his limited \nresources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment plan for the remaining \ndebts; and (3) took \u201creasonable actions to effectuate that plan.\u201d Id. The Appeal Board \nremanded the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision in that case because it did not \u201carticulate \na satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,\u201d emphasizing the Administrative Judge did \n\u201cnot explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why \nthe approach taken by applicant was not \u2018responsible\u2019 in light of his limited \ncircumstances.\u201d Id.  \nThe timing of the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts is a pertinent consideration. The \nAppeal Board has observed, \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having \nbeen placed on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness designations are in \njeopardy may be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts under AG \u00b6 20(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). Applicant established payment \nplans for 10 of 12 SOR debts before the SOR was issued. He paid two SOR debts after \nthe SOR was issued. \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith requires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant \nmust do more than merely sh\n \now that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (citations, footnote, and last \nquotation marks omitted). Applicant was sincere and candid about his endeavors to bring \nall of his debts to current or paid status and his plans to continue those efforts in the \nfuture. There are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved \nor are under control. He generated a budget or personal financial statement. He has a \nsufficient monthly remainder to achieve his financial goals. \nApplicant made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts, and I am \nconfident he will continue to resolve his SOR debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old engineering technician who has worked for a defense \ncontractor for two years. In 2007, he graduated from high school, and he completed 66 \ncollege credits. He has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, when he resolved or \nestablished payment plans on all of his debts. He understands that he needs to pay his \ndebts, and the conduct required to retain his security clearance. The Appeal Board has \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt re-payment. With the increased income from his current employment, I \nam confident he will continue to maintain his financial responsibility. Security officials have \nthe ability to monitor or re-evaluate his financial progress, and revoke his security \nclearance if he shows future financial irresponsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

(GE 1-2) \nApplicant was introduced to marijuana in middle school, using the drug when it \nwas available to her. While in high school between 2009 to 2012, she used the drug \ntwice a week to help with the symptoms of a medical condition. In 2013, at age 19, she \nobtained a prescription for medical marijuana, and purchased it at a state-sanctioned \ndispensary. After turning 21, she no longer required a prescription to purchase the drug. \n(Tr. 18-19, 29, 31-34; GE 1) \nBetween 2013 and 2017, Applicant was in college. Between 2013 and 2014, she \nworked at a funeral home. Because her position required drug testing, she abstained \nfrom marijuana. After leaving the funeral home positon in 2014, she resumed using \nmarijuana to deal with a recurring medical issue that her doctor was unable to diagnose. \nAfter graduating from community college in 2017, she decided to take a class to learn a \nskill that would make her an attractive candidate for a position at a federal contracting \ncompany. While taking the class, she abstained from marijuana to ensure that she was \neligible for hire, knowing that she would be required to pass a drug test if she received \nan offer of employment. After securing her current job in October 2018, she learned \nabout her employer\u2019s standards of business conduct, which included the admonition \nthat the company complied with the federal Drug Free Workplace Act and that because \nmarijuana remained illegal under federal law, the company prohibited its use even in \nstates where it was not against state law. (Tr. 16-17,19-20, 23-24; GE 3) \nIn October 2019, Applicant experienced pregnancy loss. Between October 2019 \nand December 2019, she used marijuana once a week to self-medicate her depressed \nmood. Concerned that her depression was not improving, she decided to get help in \nDecember 2019. She sought counseling through her employer\u2019s employee assistance \nprogram (EAP) and treatment from a psychiatrist. When Applicant began taking \nantidepressant medication in January 2020, she used marijuana once a week until April \n2020, to alleviate the side effects of the medication. She continued to use marijuana \neven after completing a security clearance application in March 2020. Once she was \nable to better tolerate the medication, she stopped using the drug. Applicant reported \nthat she has not used marijuana since April 2020. In 2021, Applicant again sought \ncounseling when she felt she needed additional support. (Tr. 17, 20-21, 24-27, 30, 35-\n36, 38-40) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she remained on antidepressant \nmedication and was under the care of a psychiatrist for medication management. \nAccording to a January 2022 letter from the treating psychiatrist, she treated Applicant \nfor anxiety and depression with a short course of medication to improve Applicant\u2019s \nmood and anxiety. The course of medication stopped when Applicant went into \nremission. The psychiatrist noted that Applicant disclosed her marijuana use and \ndescribed her as being compliant with her prescribed treatment.

She provided a \nletter of intent stating her intent to abstain from illegal drug use in the future. (Tr. 22, 30-\n31, 42; AE A) \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and personal conduct guidelines. The government has established a \nprima facie case under each. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raises questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). Applicant admits to a history of marijuana use \nbetween 2008 and April 2020. After abstaining from the drug for two years between \n2017 and 2018, she began using the drug in October 2019 to self-medicate depression. \nShe continued to use the drug between January and April 2020 after taking \nantidepressant medication and after completing a security clearance application. She \nused marijuana knowing that it was against her employer\u2019s standard of conduct policy. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct requires the application of the following disqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) Any substance misuse. \nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Applicant used marijuana to \nself-medicate recurring medical conditions. Given the circumstances of her marijuana \nuse and her long history of use, neither her statement of intent to abstain from future \nuse, nor her current period of abstinence, just over two years, is sufficient to mitigate the \nalleged security concern. Furthermore, the lifestyle changes she has made to support \nabstinence are recent and have not been in effect long enough to establish their \neffectiveness or sustainability. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. (AG \u00b6 16) The SOR cross alleges Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s use was medicinal and not recreational, doing so was an \nintentional violation of her employer\u2019s drug policy and federal law. While none of the \nenumerated disqualifying conditions apply, her conduct indicates an unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations highlighted in the general personal conduct concern as \ndetailed in AG \u00b616. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe record does contain some evidence in mitigation. Applicant recognized she \nneeded medical help to address her underlying mental health issues, and has since \nbeen under a physician\u2019s care and received counseling as needed. In addition to \nreceiving medical attention, she has also made lifestyle changes to support her mental \nhealth and encourage abstinence; however, as explained above, these changes are too \nrecent to fully mitigate the underlying concerns. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts \nunder the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana is not \nmitigated because she used the drug to manage the symptoms of two recurring medical \nconditions. While her need to address her medical issues is valid, medical marijuana \nuse is not compatible with her duties and responsibilities as an individual seeking \naccess to classified information. An adverse decision in this case is not a determination \nthat Applicant cannot achieve a sufficient period of abstinence to obtain a security \nclearance in the future. However, at this time, her marijuana use is too recent and her \nperiod of abstinence too short to mitigate the concerns raised by her history of \nmarijuana use. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Items 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant has a lengthy and consistent history of involvement with illegal drugs. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana from September 2005 until December 2020. \nFor at least some period within this timeframe, he used marijuana daily.

Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndivulge his non-marijuana illegal drug involvement in his SF 86 despite being required to \ndo so. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations without \ncomment. All of the SOR allegations are established.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nFrom 2005 to December 2020 Applicant consistently possessed, sold, \ndistributed, and used several different illegal drugs. He illegally used and distributed \nprescription drugs. He asserted in unequivocal terms that he plans to continue to use \nmarijuana and made good on this assertion by using marijuana after completing his SF \n86 and after his March 2020 interview. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. alleges that Applicant used and purchased marijuana after completing \nhis SF 86 in November 2019. The underlying conduct is already alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, \none of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.j is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed and abuse has since ended. \nApplicant's illegal drug involvement from 2005 to 2020 was frequent and has \ncontinued into adulthood. His assertion that he will continue to use marijuana combined \nwith the evidence that he continued to do so after submitting his SF 86 and after his \ninterview show that the use is ongoing and is likely to recur. This continued marijuana \nuse also precludes a finding that Applicant has established a sufficient pattern of \nabstinence. There is no evidence that he suffered from a severe or prolonged illness for \nwhich he was prescribed the prescription drugs he misused. Instead, Applicant misused \ndrugs that he had never been prescribed. \nNone of the above referenced mitigating conditions are applicable, and \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately failed to divulge his illegal drug involvement other than \nwith marijuana on his certified SF 86 in several separate sections despite it being \nrequired. He admitted that he was not being candid and was worried that his employer \nwould find out the full extent of his illegal drug involvement if he included it. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) partially applies. Applicant divulged the full extent of his illegal drug \ninvolvement to the Government during his interview before being confronted with those \nfacts. Applicant provided no evidence that he has divulged this information to his \nemployer. \nFalsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the \nsecurity clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). As \nApplicant opined that he would likely lie about his drug use to a prospective employer in \nthe future, there is insufficient evidence that Applicant has taken steps that make the \nbehavior unlikely to recur. \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person \nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular \nfacts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light \nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2006). Despite Applicant having partially met one of the mitigating conditions, \nnone of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and personal conduct security concerns \nremain. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains 13 delinquent accounts under the financial considerations guideline. These accounts are installment loan accounts, credit-card accounts, a state tax lien, two state collection accounts, two medical accounts, and a telephone account. The total amount of delinquent debt is approximately $38,144. Applicant admitted some accounts and denied others. SOR \u00b6 2.a (Guideline K) alleges that Applicant\u2019s employer terminated her employment in June 2020 for security infractions that occurred between January and June of that year. The allegation is cross-alleged under SOR \u00b6 3.a as personal conduct (Guideline E). Applicant denied both allegations. Applicant is 46 years old and single with a 28-year-old son. She graduated from high school in 1993 and attended college for a short period. She was 18 years old in 1993. (Tr. 6) At the time of the hearing, she was unemployed, but scheduled to begin employment on June 6, 2022. Between May 2009 and June 2022, Applicant has been unemployed about four times, with the period of unemployment lasting up to three months. She has held a security clearance since 2015. (GE 1 at 14-22, 39) Before her current unemployment, Applicant worked as a security specialist for three months from February to May 2022, when the program manager terminated her because of \u201ca conflict of attitude with the program, with the team lead.\u201d (Tr. 68) The team lead repeatedly disrespected her in front of customers.

Applicant admitted some \naccounts and denied others. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a (Guideline K) alleges that Applicant\u2019s employer terminated her \nemployment in June 2020 for security infractions that occurred between January and \nJune of that year. The allegation is cross-alleged under SOR \u00b6 3.a as personal conduct \n(Guideline E). Applicant denied both allegations. \nApplicant is 46 years old and single with a 28-year-old son. She graduated from \nhigh school in 1993 and attended college for a short period. She was 18 years old in \n1993. (Tr. 6) At the time of the hearing, she was unemployed, but scheduled to begin \nemployment on June 6, 2022. Between May 2009 and June 2022, Applicant has been \nunemployed about four times, with the period of unemployment lasting up to three \nmonths. She has held a security clearance since 2015. (GE 1 at 14-22, 39) \nBefore her current unemployment, Applicant worked as a security specialist for \nthree months from February to May 2022, when the program manager terminated her \nbecause of \u201ca conflict of attitude with the program, with the team lead.\u201d (Tr. 68) The \nteam lead repeatedly disrespected her in front of customers. She complained to the \nteam manager, but she indicated management took no action. (Tr. 64-68) This \nunalleged conduct, which cannot be used as the sole basis for an unfavorable decision, \nwill be considered to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, to assess her case in mitigation, and \nto provide evidence in the whole-person section of this determination. ISCR Case No. \n16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 2, 2017) \nFrom August 2020 to February 2022, Applicant worked in a non-personnel \nsecurity job for another contractor. During her employment, she received two bonuses \nfor professionalism and notable work performance. She voluntarily left this job because \nshe wanted to return to personnel security. Before this job and after her termination \nfrom the employer identified in SOR \u00b6 2.a (next paragraph), she was unemployed for \nabout two months. (Tr. 64-68) \nFrom November 2019 to June 2020, Applicant was employed by a defense \ncontractor (SOR \u00b6 2.a) as a personnel security specialist. She indicated that she was \nterminated in June 2020 because she was not \u201ca good fit\u201d for the job. She left by mutual \nagreement following notice of unsatisfactory job performance. She never received a \nwritten warning, officially reprimanded, or suspended for misconduct in the workplace, \nsuch as a violation of security policy.

Then she \nindicated that the trouble started when, at about age 19 (circa 1994), she received her \nfirst credit card under bait-and-switch circumstances. She explained the cycle of making \npayments on the card for a period then losing her job, only to resume employment and \nresuming payments for a while, and then losing her job again. In the past ten-year \nperiod, she signed up with five credit repair services. If Applicant did not see promises \nfulfilled by the credit services within a 45-day period, i.e., debts removed from her credit \nreport, she would move onto a different credit repair service. When she discovered she \ncould send out the same letters to creditors or agencies that the credit repair firms were \nsending, she terminated her link to the credit services. Applicant provided no \ndocumentation to substantiate her claims of participation in the credit-repair services or \nsending letters to the creditors. She provided no evidence of financial counseling. (GE 1 \nat 40-41; GE 2 at 6; Tr. 59-61) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant opened this auto loan in January 2012.

She \nhas not resolved the delinquent account. (GE 2 at 9; GE 6 at 4; GE 7 at 3, 6) \nAt the hearing, Applicant claimed that the car was totaled some time in 2013 to \n2015. She promised to obtain documentation from a car insurance company indicating \nthat they paid off the delinquency. In her post-hearing documentation, she was unable \nto locate documentation bolstering her claim that the car was totaled rather than \nrepossessed. (Tr. 31-33; AE C at 2) This account is unresolved. Applicant provided \nconsiderable testimony about other cars she has owned over the years. The testimony \nhas no probative value to this allegation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 This is a past-due medical account transferred to a collection \nagency. The account became delinquent in June 2020. Applicant was disputing the \namount because she made a $978 copayment before she had surgery. She spoke with \nthe collection agency about three weeks before the hearing, but had not taken \nadditional action on the account.

(GE 10 at 1; GE 11 at 1; Tr. 57-59) \nApplicant provided no proof of a payment plan or a record of payments. \nRegarding a budget, Applicant testified that she has a written monthly budget \nbecause she is trying to get control over her financial obligations. She prepares the \nbudget on her computer and would be able to produce that documentation with her \nother post-hearing material. (Tr. 84-86) She did not submit a budget. \nSOR \u00b6 2(a) alleges that Applicant was terminated for cause from her \nemployment for noted security infractions that occurred between January and June \n2020, despite counseling and remedial training. The security infractions appear in a \nreport dated June 22, 2020. See GE 4 at 1-3. The program executive officer, the \ncorporate security officer, and Applicant\u2019s team leader contributed to the report. The \nreport identified 13 security infractions culminating in Applicant not responding to a \nsecurity company\u2019s May 31, 2020 request for her to rearm an area of the facility that \nwas unarmed. Applicant contends that the listed security infractions and violations in the \nreport were based on missing security forms that were filled out on a daily basis by the \nemployee on duty to verify a safe was properly locked or a room was properly armed. \nApplicant\u2019s team leader accused Applicant of not filling out the security form on May 31, \n2020, and on other occasions. Applicant denied the accusation, asserting that she had \nfilled out all security forms as required. Applicant viewed the security infractions as a \nmanifestation of the team leader\u2019s antipathy towards her. Because the team leader\u2019s \nmother passed away from the same illness Applicant\u2019s son was suffering from, \nApplicant mistakenly thought she had formed a bond with the team leader. (GE 2 at 4-6; \nGE 4 at 1-3; Tr. 74-75) \nApplicant was employed as a security specialist from November 2019 to June \n2020. She claimed she never received training on how to handle classified information \nor adequate counseling and or training related to executing her job responsibilities. No \none ever notified Applicant in writing about the security infractions. (Tr. 27-29, 71) \nApplicant testified that this was the first time she had ever worked in a sensitive \ncompartmented information facility (SCIF) within the larger facility. The team lead never \nshowed her the procedures for maintaining accountability for entering and exiting the \nSCIF. Rather than receiving formal instruction through a Government network on how to \noperate a SCIF, Applicant\u2019s only training occurred by watching a coworker or the team \nlead perform the tasks needed to manage the SCIF. (Tr. 70-73, 78) \nOn May 31, 2020, an outside security company called Applicant, who was on \nduty at the time, to determine why the sixth floor of the facility was not armed. The team \nleader asked her a day or two later why she did not respond to the company\u2019s call by \nreturning to the facility to arm the sixth floor. Applicant replied that: (1) she simply did \nnot respond to the call from the security company; (2) she did not respond because of \ncivil protests in the area; and (3) she was returning from an out-of-state location.

She also intended to contact a \ncoworker who would back her claims. (Tr. 74-78) Applicant submitted no independent \nevidence to support her assertions. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, \nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress \ncan also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security \nconcern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19.

Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has accumulated 13 debts since 2014. Eleven of the delinquent debts \nare still unpaid. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s indebtedness \nwill not recur in the future. Her overall inability to meet her financial obligations casts \ndoubt on her trustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG 20(b) is available for mitigation when the conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problems were largely beyond an applicant\u2019s control. Since May 2009 and \nJune 2022, Applicant\u2019s four periods of unemployment entitle her to mitigation. However, \nthe mitigation due is substantially reduced because on two occasions, the reasons for \nher unemployment were largely within her control. On several occasions, Applicant \nmentioned her son\u2019s medical condition as a reason for her financial problems, but she \nprovided no documentation to show how his condition affected her finances. \nIn order to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), an applicant must act \nresponsibly regarding the unanticipated events.

Promises to pay the debts in the future is not a substitute for a meaningful track \nrecord of repaying debts. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013) \nAG \u00b6 20 (c) has negligible application. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.g even though the debt was not satisfied until \nMay 31, 2022, the day of Applicant\u2019s hearing. Aside from the SOR \u00b6 1.j account, which \nis unsubstantiated by the Government\u2019s evidence, Applicant has provided insufficient \nevidence of having taken good-faith actions on the remaining 11 delinquent accounts. \nHandling protected Information \nThe security concerns of the guideline handling protected information are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information, which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information, raising \ndoubts about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is  serious \nsecurity concern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling \nby management. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of security infractions from January to June 2020, ending in \na deliberate decision not to return to the facility to arm a floor and secure safes at her \nemployer\u2019s facility, clearly exposed the floor, the safes, and her former employer to \npossible exposure and compromise of protected information to unauthorized persons. \nPermitting employees in an unauthorized area, or allowing federal employees without \nproper identification into the security office, or not properly arming rooms, floors, or \nlocking safes, over a six-month period, despite verbal counseling and training from \nmanagement, fall within the scope of AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(g) and 34(h). \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training \nor unclear instructions; and  \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s 13 security infractions over a six-month period, less than \nthree years ago, and her subsequent employment termination in May 2022 under \nsimilar circumstances, I am unable to find AG \u00b6 35(a) in her favor. \nApplicant denied that any of the security infractions occurred in the six-month \nperiod between January and June 2020. She denied receiving any written \ndocumentation concerning training or counseling for the security infractions. The only \ntraining she claimed that she received was brief verbal training by a coworker or the \nteam leader. I find that Applicant\u2019s continuing unsubstantiated denials are not credible \nand undermine confidence in her judgment and reliability. Her security infractions, which \nare aggravated by their repetitive nature and frequency despite counseling and training, \nprecludes mitigation from AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(c) and 35(d). \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation or further processing for \nnational security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that he may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information; \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient \nconfidentiality, release \nof \nproprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information \u2026 \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nGuideline E addresses conduct of a questionable nature, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to obey rules and regulations that raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment and ability to protect classified information. Since the evidence submitted \nunder the guidelines for financial considerations and handling protected information is \nsufficient under either guideline for an adverse determination, discussion of the \nguideline for personal conduct is unnecessary. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) nor 16(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n11 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nApplicant is 46 years old and has a 28-year-old son with a medical condition. \nShe has held a security clearance since 2015. She indicated that she received two \nperformance bonuses during her employment from August 2020 to February 2022. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, the adverse evidence that disqualifies \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application is more substantial. To Applicant\u2019s credit, she \nsatisfied one car loan (SOR \u00b6 1g) on May 31, 2022, and the Government did not \npresent sufficient evidence concerning SOR \u00b6 1.j. However, Applicant still owes 11 \ndelinquent accounts.  \nRegarding the handling protected information, Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated \nclaims that the security infractions never occurred are not credible. Her repeated claims \nthat she never received written documentation regarding training, counseling, as well as \nwritten documentation about the security infractions, do not make the infractions less \nbelievable. The security infractions are even more convincing when weighed with \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent termination in May 2022 because of a similar personality conflict \nwith her team leader. Judging by the totality of all the evidence under the whole-person \nconcept, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to dispel the security concerns \nraised by the guidelines for financial considerations and handling protected information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.i, 1.k-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g, 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nWITHDRAWN \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Applicant did \nnot object. I have taken administrative notice of facts contained in GE 6, updated and \nexpanded them via publicly available government websites, and summarized them below. \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan \nPakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups, and \nsuccessive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even \nsupported some of them as proxies in Pakistan\u2019s historical conflicts with its neighbors. \nTerrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. Kidnapping \nis a concern throughout Pakistan, and extremist groups and criminals have targeted \nbusiness owners and prominent families to finance terror operations. U.S. citizens have \nbeen kidnapped in other countries and held in Pakistan. \nU.S. policy is to assist the creation of a more stable, democratic, and prosperous \nPakistan, and has given billions in assistance. However, since the revelation that Al \nQaeda leader Osama bin Laden had enjoyed years-long refuge in Pakistan, the U.S. \nsuspended security assistance in 2018, with few exceptions. Pakistan remains a safe \nharbor for regionally focused terrorist groups. \nIn a 2011 report to Congress, the Office of the National Counterintelligence \nExecutive reported that sensitive U.S. economic information and technology are targeted \nby the intelligence services, private sectors, academic research institutions, and citizens \nof dozens of countries, including Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence testified to \u201cPakistan\u2019s recalcitrance in dealing with militant groups\u201d and \npredicted that Pakistan will continue to threaten U.S. interests \u201cby deploying new nuclear \nweapons capabilities, maintaining its ties to militants, restricting counterterrorism \ncooperation, and drawing closer to China.\u201d \nSignificant human rights issues remain in Pakistan, including unlawful or arbitrary \nkillings by the government or its agents; torture and cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment; arbitrary detention and harsh or life-threatening prison \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions; political prisoners; politically motivated reprisal against individuals located \noutside the country; arbitrary and unlawful government interference with privacy; serious \nrestrictions on free expression and the press; government interference with peaceful \nassembly; severe restrictions on religious freedom; corruption and crimes against \npersonal and religious freedoms, and ethnic minorities. There is a lack of governmental \naccountability, and government officials were rarely punished for human rights abuses. \nThe U.S. Department of State issued a level 3 advisory (\u201creconsider travel\u201d) for \nPakistan on February 7, 2022, due to terrorism and sectarian violence. Additionally, \nDepartment of State assessed Islamabad, Peshawar, and Lahore as being critical-threat \nlocations for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 27 years old.

When traveling to Pakistan, he visited with his grandmother and since \nmarrying, his in-laws. In 2019, he also traveled to Turkey and to Saudi Arabia for a \nreligious pilgrimage with his parents, sister, and spouse. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse became a naturalized U.S. citizen on March 1, 2022 and they \nreside together in the U.S. It is unclear how he met his spouse. His grandmother is an \nunemployed citizen and resident of Lahore, Pakistan. Applicant visited with her when he \ntraveled to Pakistan. He noted in his answer to the SOR, that his contact with her is \u201cvery \ncasual and limited to greetings, asking how she is doing, and in return she does the \nsame.\u201d She is unfamiliar with his job and has not asked about his employment. His in-\nlaws are also citizens and residents of Lahore, Pakistan. He interacts with his father-in-\nlaw quarterly, or about three to four times per year.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro.

Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Pakistan residing in the \nU.S., and his grandmother, father-in-law, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nPakistan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering \nhistory of that government are among the important considerations that provide context \nfor the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018). \nWhen family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). [T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse. ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); \nsee also ISCR Case No. 09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). Applicant has not \nrebutted this presumption. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e) and 7(f) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019).

The U.S. Department of State has \nissued a level 3 advisory (\u201creconsider travel\u201d) for Pakistan due to terrorism and sectarian \nviolence. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established with respect to Applicant\u2019s ties to family \nmembers that remain in Pakistan. Pakistan has supported the targeting of sensitive U.S. \ntechnology and military information. In addition, its history of support for terrorism, \ndomestic violence, crimes against foreigners, government corruption, and significant \nhuman-rights violations are sufficient to meet the low standard of \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d was recognized in the U.S. State Department Level 3 Travel Advisory \n(reconsider travel) in February 2022. The same factors that establish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nare sufficient to establish a potential risk of a conflict of interest. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): \n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has provided very little background information on his grandmother and \nin-laws living in Pakistan. Applicant maintains regular and recurring contact with each \nperson, and has visited often, but I do not know whether their family members in Pakistan \nhave had any personal or political ties to or employment with the Pakistani government, \nmilitary, intelligence agencies, defense establishment, or terrorist group. It is \nunderstandable that Applicant maintains some ties to his and his spouse\u2019s family in \nPakistan, but it is not credible that he knowns very little about the family members\u2019 \nbackgrounds after maintaining telephone/Internet and personal contact over the years. \nAdditionally, he has not provided clear and convincing information regarding his financial \nstatus, community involvement, employment performance, or personal and professional \ncharacter showing the degree of his ties and loyalty to the U.S.; information that would \nhave been helpful in establishing mitigating credit. Based on the record presented, I am \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s close ties to family members in Pakistan would not \nplace him in a conflicted position. As stated above, the protection of the national security \nis the paramount consideration and any doubt must be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity. Based on the paucity of information provided in the record, I am unable to find \nany of the mitigating conditions to be fully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \ncitizenship and efforts to obtain citizenship for his spouse. I also evaluated this case under \nthe conditions in which a conditional clearance may be granted. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor, or to \nfurther inquire about foreign influence matters. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised by his ties to \nforeign nationals residing in Pakistan. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 8, 2022.    \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56-years-old. He has been married since 1988 and has two adult \nchildren. He received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering in 1988 \nand 1994, respectively. He was employed in various positions for a federal contractor \nfrom June 1990 to November 2019, and has been employed as a senior system engineer \nfor another federal contractor since November 2019. He supported the same DoD agency \nfor more than 20 years until June 2020. (GE 1, 3; AE C, D, F-H, K, L; Tr. 22-23, 38-39, \n54-55) \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1988. He was granted access to a \nclassified DoD IT system in approximately 2005. He was provided email accounts on \nclassified and unclassified DoD IT systems and issued a Government laptop computer. \nHe has received training on information security and the proper handling of classified \ninformation, including periodic refresher training. His access to classified information was \nsuspended in June 2020 and his security clearance was suspended in November 2020. \n(GE 1, 3, 4, 7; AE D; Tr. 12-23, 42, 48, 55-56, 73-74) \nFrom approximately 1999 to March 2020, Applicant maintained a large, \ncomprehensive electronic spreadsheet file (spreadsheet) containing his personal \ninformation including commercial account access information, tax and other financial \ninformation, medical information, and to-do lists. The spreadsheet included approximately \n20 worksheet tabs of information. From approximately 1999 to 2015, he maintained the \nspreadsheet on an encrypted, personal universal serial bus (USB) drive that he accessed \nand updated, at home or work, as needed. He reported that in approximately 2015, DoD \nrevised its information security rules and prohibited the introduction of personal USB \ndrives onto DoD IT equipment. From 2015 to 2019, he maintained and routinely \ntransmitted the spreadsheet as an encrypted, password protected file between his DoD \nand personal email accounts. (GE 2; AE L; Tr. 38-43, 53-58) \nFrom at least 2015 to March 2020, he also maintained protected DoD information \nin the spreadsheet including safe access information, and personal identification numbers \n(PINs) for facility access, unclassified and classified IT network access, and for his DoD \nID card. The word \u201cSafe\u201d was followed by a six letter passcode which could be converted \ninto a DoD safe\u2019s numerical combination.

(Tr. 41) He routinely accessed and \nrevised the spreadsheet to reflect changes in his personal and protected DoD information \nincluding the safe\u2019s passcode in 2017. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE L; Tr. 40-42, 53-57) \nApplicant reported that in 2019, the DoD agency he supported revised their \ninformation security rules to prohibit transmission or receipt of encrypted emails between \nDoD and personal email accounts. He said that in compliance with that policy, he ceased \nemailing updated versions of the encrypted file from his personal email account to his \nDoD email account. By March 2020, he reached a point where the copy of his personal \ninformation was dated and he felt it necessary to have an updated spreadsheet available \nfor access at work. He attempted to email the encrypted spreadsheet file between his \npersonal and DoD email accounts a couple of times, but the files could not be processed. \nHe said that he then removed the encryption and attached the spreadsheet to emails that \nhe transmitted between his personal and DoD email accounts. (GE 4; AE L) \nIn April 2020, DoD security personnel notified Applicant that they were conducting \na preliminary inquiry into the suspected spillage of classified information attributable to \nhis March 2020 email transmission of a file that included a safe passcode. He confirmed \nthe spreadsheet contained the word \u201cSafe\u201d followed by a passcode for a DoD safe that \nhe previously had access to, and also included his DoD IT network PINs. (AE L at 2-3) \nHe admitted his responsibility for including that information in the spreadsheet. He \nreported sending approximately four written responses to the DoD security personnel \nconducting the preliminary inquiry between April 24 and June 2, 2020, \u201cto explain [his] \nactions and answer questions.\u201d (AE L at 3) He has repeatedly claimed that he did not \nrecall the spreadsheet included the DoD Safe passcode when he transmitted the March \n2020 emails. He stated that he informed DoD security personnel conducting the \npreliminary inquiry that he included the DoD information in the spreadsheet \n\u201capproximately a year ago\u201d or \u201csometime in early/mid 2019\u201d because that \u201cwas the last \ntime [he] had sent the spreadsheet to his [DoD] computer\u201d and because it had been \napproximately a year since he had access to that safe. (AE L at 3) He also stated that \nwhen initially questioned about the incident he admitted that he had made such a transfer \n\u201ca couple of times in [March] 2020.\u201d (GE 4 at 2) He said that he was focused on the \nsuspected March 2020 spillage in his responses, and that he was attempting to only \nanswer the question asked, because he was sensitive to engineers\u2019 reputation for being \ntoo long-winded in their responses. (GE 4; AE L; Tr. 58-61, 74-76)  \nApplicant has stated that prior to submitting his June 4, 2020 response, he was \nanxious that the Government\u2019s \u201cconcern could now be about my long-term transferring of \nmy file. My mind was fixed, however, on the thought that I needed to answer the question \nthat was being asked (my March 2020 infraction) and that it was not correct to bring in a \nnew \u2018broader\u2019 email concern.\u201d (AE-L at 3) He also noted that if he could have discussed \ndetails of his compromise with someone other than a direct security manager, it would \nhave been possible for him to discuss his use of the spreadsheet in the context of the \nGuideline E allegations.

A preliminary inquiry found that the spreadsheet \ncontained classified information. Further analysis by security personnel determined that \nhe had transmitted a version of the spreadsheet including sensitive DoD information from \nhis unclassified DoD email account to his personal email account approximately once a \nweek (223 times) from at least 2015 to March 2020, and that over a period of several \nyears he appeared to routinely update sensitive DoD information in the spreadsheet, \nincluding the safe passcode in 2017. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE L; Tr. 49, 79-99) \nIn his July 2020 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he \nhad been warned or disciplined in April 2020, because he \u201csent FOUO Information (PII) \nin an unclassified email environment,\u201d and \u201cstored and sent classified information within \nan unclassified email environment.\u201d (GE 1 at 12-13) He reported that his security \nclearance eligibility/access had been suspended in June 2020 because he \u201csent classified \ninformation within an unclassified environment.\u201d (GE 1 at 39) \nApplicant stated that in June 2020, he learned that the DoD security concerns were \nhis long-term transmission of a spreadsheet, and lack of transparency about his conduct.\nHe said that he \u201cmade full disclosure of [his] actions at [his] next opportunity, which was\nduring his [security clearance background interviews]\u201d in July and August 2020. (AE L at\n3) During those background interviews with a government investigator, Applicant said that\nhe had transmitted the spreadsheet as an encrypted file between his personal and DoD\nemail accounts. He reported that in March 2020, he unsuccessfully attempted to email\nthe encrypted spreadsheet file between his personal and DoD email accounts a couple\nof times, \u201cbut the files could not be processed.\u201d (GE 4 at 1, 2) He said that he then\nremoved the encryption and transmitted the spreadsheet. When asked why he had tried\nto send the encrypted file after a policy prohibiting that practice was instituted, he said\nthat policy was neither written nor explicit and that when he had previously tried to send\nan encrypted file and the system would not permit its transmission, he had assumed, or\nit was implied that transmission of encrypted documents was prohibited by policy. (GE 4\nat 5-6) He said he had forgotten the spreadsheet included his classified DoD IT network\nPIN, DoD ID PIN, and safe passcode. He also told a background investigator that he had\nadded the DoD safe passcode to the spreadsheet approximately a year earlier and sent\nthose files to himself via email. (GE 4 at 3) He said that he last accessed classified\ndocuments in the safe in mid-2019, while working for a previous employer. He also said\nthat the safe had since been relocated and was no longer used for classified storage. He\nacknowledged that he was not supposed to store classified information with personal\ninformation, and said that he had been trained on and was aware of policies regulating\nthe use of DoD email, and the protection of sensitive and classified information.

In response to the SOR, he admitted the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, explaining that he had intended to transmit his personal information, but \nhad forgotten that he had previously included sensitive DoD information in the \nspreadsheet. He said that he had been told this information was not classified, that he \nhad previously included it in the file because he feared that he might forget the access \ninformation, and that his conduct was an inadvertent, isolated event. (SOR Response) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.c allege that Applicant exhibited a prolonged pattern of behavior \nthat endangered DoD information security, and that between 2015 and 2020 he routinely \nupdated sensitive DoD information in the spreadsheet file he sent between his DoD and \npersonal email accounts including a safe passcode, and that those actions contradicted \nwritten statements he provided to security officials. In response to the SOR he admitted, \nin part, and denied, in part, those allegations explaining that: \nI sent my personal file to my personal email. I would do this periodically to \nprovide myself updates regarding my [personal information]. Approximately \na year prior to the security incident, I included the sensitive information in \nmy personal file so I would not forget it in case I needed to lock up \nsomething classified. I did this so long ago, that when I sent the file, I had \nforgotten the sensitive information was also included. . . . The file contained \nmy personal information, which I would occasionally update if necessary. \nWhen making my written statements, I stated that \u201capproximately a year \nago, I included this information\u201d in reference to the sensitive information \nincluded in the file update I sent in March 2020. \n(SOR Response at 2, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that about once a week from 2015 to March 2020, Applicant \nemailed a spreadsheet containing his own personal information, including financial, \nmedical, and commercial account access codes, from his work email account to his \npersonal email account. He admitted the allegation noting that the spreadsheet was \nencrypted, except for transmissions in March 2020. (SOR Response at 3-5). \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that he was likely aware that he was mishandling sensitive data, \nthat he provided misleading responses to security officials investigating the matter, and \nthat he misled officials about the nature and extent of his behavior. He denied that \nallegation, stating that he truthfully answered questions from security officials. (SOR \nResponse at 2, 4) \nThe Government submitted an Information Security Program instruction, effective \nMarch 22, 2018, for the DoD agency that Applicant had supported.

(GE 5 at 10, 32, 54) \nApplicant testified that from at least 2015 to March 2020, he transmitted a \nspreadsheet that included a passcode for a DoD safe used to store classified information \nbetween his DoD and personal email accounts. (Tr. 58-64) He said the word \u201cSafe\u201d was \nfollowed by a six letter word that correlated to the safe\u2019s numerical combination, but did \nnot specify the safe\u2019s location or number. (Tr. 60-64; AE l at 1-3) He testified that he was \nnotified in April 2020 that the presence of safe password in an email attachment was \nbeing investigated as spillage of classified information. (Tr. 59-60) He disputed that the \nspreadsheet included classified information, stating that he understood from training that \na piece of information without context was not by itself classified. (Tr. 26-29; AE L at 2). \nHe testified that he believed that his DoD PINs including his classified IT network, facility \naccess, and ID card PINs were sensitive, but not classified information. (Tr. 30-32, 35, \n48-51, 64-67; AE L at 2) He acknowledged that he had not asked whether the \naforementioned DoD information was classified or not. (Tr. 48) He said that he notified \nhis company\u2019s security officer about the potential March 2020 spillage, after he was \ninformed of the suspected spillage by a DoD security officer in April 2020. (Tr. 35-36, 50-\n52) He testified that he did not disclose that he had updated DoD sensitive information in \nthe spreadsheet for a number of years because he was focused on the unencrypted \nMarch 2020 email. (Tr. 34-35) He said that he did not understand the concern was about \n\u201cthe issue over the extended period of time since 2015,\u201d until June 2020 after his company \nreceived a letter explaining why his facility access had been revoked. (Tr. 51-52, 74-76). \nHe testified that he had complied with post-incident counselling, and had removed all DoD \nsensitive information from the spreadsheet. (Tr. 35-36)     \nHe testified that he kept back-up copies of the spreadsheet including the sensitive \nDoD information on his home computer and in a commercial storage system. (Tr. 64). He \nsaid that prior to March 2020, the spreadsheet file was encrypted in order to protect the \ncontents. He noted that it was regular practice at the agency he supported, and consistent \nwith his training to encrypt CUI and FOUO information transmitted via unclassified email. \n(Tr. 28-29) He explained that he had reported transmitting classified information in his \nSCA, because he was answering the questions that were asked. He testified that he had \ntruthfully answered all investigator and SCA questions, based upon his understanding of \nthose questions at the time. (Tr. 35) He also testified that sometime in 2019 the DoD \nagency he supported prohibited the transmission of encrypted emails to and from that \nagency.

(SOR Response; AE A-L) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; and \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation.  \nApplicant admitted that he improperly sent an email with an attached spreadsheet \ncontaining sensitive DoD information in March 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He acknowledged that \na preliminary inquiry concluded that the spreadsheet he transmitted from his unclassified \nDoD email account to his personal email account contained classified information and \nthat the transmission of classified information over unclassified networks was prohibited, \nbut has repeatedly stated his belief that the spreadsheet did not contain classified \ninformation. (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The Government presented substantial, unrebutted evidence \nthat the spreadsheet contained classified information including documentary evidence \nthat it contained unspecified classified information, and testimony that Applicant\u2019s \nclassified IT network PIN was classified information.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate handling protected information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities;  \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and  \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nSecurity violations \u201cstrike at the heart of the industrial security program\u201d and are \none of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified \ninformation, because they raise serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information.

ISCR Case No. 14-05127 at 8 (App. Bd. June \n24, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 35(a) does not apply. Applicant improperly handled and transmitted protected \nDoD information frequently and recently (223 times from 2015 to March 2020).

Applicant acknowledged that he had been trained on \ninformation security and the proper handling of classified and sensitive information \nincluding periodic refresher training prior to the March 2020 incident. \nAG \u00b6 35(d) does not apply. Applicant routinely updated and transmitted the \nspreadsheet including protected DoD information to and from his personal email account \nfrom at least 2015 to March 2020. He first reported his security violation approximately \none month after his March 2020 email transmission, after DoD security officials had \nnotified him that his email transmission was being investigated as suspected spillage of \nclassified information. \nHandling protected information security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's\ntime or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing[.] \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and is equally \na security concern under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s transmission of a \nspreadsheet containing protected DoD information including classified information to his \npersonal email account damaged his personal, professional, and community standing, \nand created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \nestablished. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges under the personal conduct guideline that about once a week, \nfrom 2015 to March 2020, he emailed a version of the spreadsheet containing his own \npersonal data from his DoD email to his personal email account. Applicant repeatedly \nstated that he encrypted the spreadsheet in every email transmission except in March \n2020. No evidence from a witness, a regulation, an investigation, or similar source was \npresented to contradict his statements. There is insufficient evidence to support a \nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s transmission of his own personal information via encrypted \nemail raised a security concern under Guideline E. To the extent that any personal \nconduct security concern may have been raised by his unencrypted transmission of his \nown personal information in March 2022, that concern is mitigated, because the behavior \nwas infrequent, he has since acknowledged and been counselled on that behavior, that \nbehavior is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. I find for Applicant on the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d, the record as whole reflects that from at least \n2015 to March 2020 Applicant maintained and updated protected DoD information in a \nspreadsheet that he routinely transmitted between his DoD email and personal email \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccounts, and that those actions contradicted written statements he provided to DoD \nsecurity officials inquiring into the suspected spillage of classified information contained \nin the spreadsheet attached to his March 2020 email. For AG \u00b6 16(b) to apply to the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d, Applicant had to deliberately provide false or \nmisleading information or deliberately omit information relevant to security officials. \nApplicant has admitted that in written statements to DoD security officials \nconducting a preliminary inquiry into the suspected compromise of classified information \nthat he stated that he included sensitive DoD information in the spreadsheet for \napproximately one year prior to March 2020. He subsequently admitted that he included \nthe Safe passcode and other sensitive information in the spreadsheet from at least 2015 \nto March 2020, and that he had routinely emailed that information between his DoD and \npersonal email accounts during that timeframe. Applicant denies that he deliberately \nmisled those security officials. When an allegation of falsification is controverted, the \nGovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove an applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant's state of mind at the time of a falsification or omission. See ISCR Case No.  03-\n09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (citation omitted). \nConsidering the record as a whole, I do not find Applicant\u2019s claims that he did not \nintentionally mislead the DoD personnel conducting the preliminary inquiry credible. His \nwritten response that he had included the sensitive DoD information in the spreadsheet \napproximately a year before March 2020 was false or, at a minimum, incomplete. I \nconclude that he either deliberately falsified this information, or deliberately omitted \ninformation key to determining the duration of his conduct for the following reasons. \nFirst, his explanation that he made the statement because that was the last time \nthat he had sent the spreadsheet to his DoD computer is contradicted by evidence that \nhe transmitted the spreadsheet approximately weekly from 2015 to March 2020. Second, \nI find his claim that he made that statement because that was the last time he had \naccessed the DoD safe unpersuasive in the context of a preliminary inquiry into the \nsuspected spillage of classified information in an unclassified email. Third, he repeated \nthe claim that he had added the safe passcode to the spreadsheet approximately a year \nprior to the March 2020 incident to a background investigator in July 2020. This is notable \nbecause he claimed that he fully disclosed the scope of his conduct in that background \ninterview after learning that DoD was concerned about his long-term transmission of the \nspreadsheet. Finally, Applicant\u2019s insight into his own state of mind at the time supports a \nconclusion that he deliberately omitted information about the duration of his conduct. \nSpecifically, he acknowledged that he considered disclosing his long-term transmission \nof the protected DoD information to officials conducting the preliminary inquiry, but did not \ndo so, because in the context of the question asked and based upon his own mindset, he \ndecided \u201cthat it was not correct to bring in a new \u2018broader\u2019 email concern.\u201d (AE-L at 3). \nBased on all the evidence, I find that the Government has established that the \nApplicant deliberately provided false information, or intentionally omitted information \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout how long he maintained protected information in the spreadsheet to DoD security \nofficials conducting the preliminary inquiry. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies. When the same conduct \nis alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, as in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Therefore, SOR \u00b6 2.d is concluded for Applicant. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nAG \u00b6I\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious and \nfrequent. He routinely updated protected DoD information in a spreadsheet that he \nmaintained outside of a DoD network, and, from 2015 to March 2020, transmitted that \nprotected information at least 223 times between his unclassified DoD and personal email \naccounts. In March 2020, he transmitted an email with sensitive and classified DoD \ninformation from his DoD to his personal email account that created a vulnerability to \nexploitation or manipulation. When questioned by DoD security officials inquiring into the \nsuspected spillage of classified information contained in his March 2020 email, he \ndeliberately misled those officials about the duration of his conduct. Although he \nacknowledged the behavior and was counseled by his employer, there is insufficient \nevidence to support a conclusion that the behavior is unlikely to recur, or that Applicant \nmade prompt good-faith efforts to correct his omission or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts. \nBased upon the entire record, I cannot find that such behavior is unlikely to recur \nand do find that his conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Guideline E security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline K, and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 56-years-old, held an active security clearance from \n1988 to at least June 2020, and received regular training on information security and the \nproper handling of classified information. I considered that he has worked on significant \ndefense projects since 1990, has an excellent reputation for reliability, good character, \nrecognized technical skills, and has a sound record of performance. I also considered \nthat there is no evidence that the protected information contained in the spreadsheet was \ncompromised and that he was counselled on the proper handling of sensitive information \nafter the March 2020 incident. \nHowever, when faced with the common modern day challenge of keeping track of \nDoD passwords and PIN codes necessary to perform his duties, Applicant exercised poor \njudgment and decided to integrate that information into a spreadsheet that included \nextensive personal information. From at least 2015 until March 2020 he stored the \nspreadsheet on private servers, updated, and routinely transmitted it between his \nunclassified DoD and personal email accounts. Although the DoD agency he supported \nhad prohibited the transmission of CUI to personal electronic accounts since at least \nMarch 2018, and notwithstanding his understanding that agency had prohibited the \ntransmission of encrypted emails outside of DoD sometime in 2019, he transmitted \nencrypted versions of the spreadsheet in 2019, and attempted to do so again in March \n2020. When he could not successfully transmit the encrypted spreadsheet file, he \nremoved the encryption and transmitted it between his personal and DoD email accounts \nbecause he wanted to have access to his personal information at work. \nApplicant apparently believed that he had diluted the details of the DoD information \nto such a degree that he could permissibly maintain and transmit that information outside \nof DoD systems, but DoD security officials disagreed. Those officials determined that the \nspreadsheet contained both sensitive and classified DoD information. When questioned \nabout his suspected spillage of classified information, Applicant deliberately misled DoD \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nofficials about how long he had maintained that information, and understated how many \ntimes he had transmitted it. In an SCA completed in June 2020, he disclosed that he had \nbeen disciplined and that his security clearance access had been suspended because he \nhad sent FOUO Information, and stored and sent classified information in an unclassified \nemail environment. He has since disputed, without corroborating evidence, that the \nspreadsheet contained classified information. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines K and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on handling protected information or \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The \ncase was assigned to me on April 6, 2022. On April 20, 2022, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for May 11, 2022, to occur virtually through an online platform. \nI convened Applicant\u2019s hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were marked and admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified but provided no documents.

(Tr. 26) His admissions are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He graduated from high school in 1998 and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. He has never married and has no children. Applicant has \nspent most of his professional career as an engineer in the aerospace field. He worked \nfor an aerospace company, contractor A, between 2006 and 2017 in state 1.

He reported using marijuana daily while in college. Applicant disclosed \non his SCA that while employed with contractor A, he used marijuana \u201cmuch more \ninfrequently. I quit for many years due to random testing (about 2014 to 2017)\u201d (GE 1 at \n35) After leaving contractor A in 2017, he reported that he \u201cused it daily for two years. I \nthen mostly quit\u201d and used it only rarely. In the nine months before submitting his \nSeptember 2019 SCA, he used marijuana once, at a friend\u2019s birthday party. Applicant \nsaid he was no longer interested in using marijuana and no longer associates with old \nfriends.

He also acknowledged using marijuana with a \nclearance and while the company had a drug policy in place. He further acknowledged \nknowing marijuana use is not considered lawful use under federal law. (Tr. 30; GE 3) \nGovernment Exhibit 3 details the substance abuse policy of contractor A, as of \nAugust 21, 2015. It includes the following: \n[Contractor A] follows substance abuse policies and procedures that are \nappropriate to the work environments, business conditions, and the overall \ninterests of the Company. Implementation of this Policy is subject to \nrestrictions contained in federal laws, and to the extent not inconsistent \nwith federal government contractor requirements, state and local laws. \n(GE 3 at 2) \nPolicy: 1: Whenever employees are working, are operating [Contractor A] \nequipment or vehicles, are present on [Contractor A] premises, or are \nconducting company-related work off-site, they are prohibited from: \nUsing, possessing, buying selling, manufacturing, or dispensing illegal \ndrugs (as defined under federal law and this Policy, including possession \nof drug paraphernalia;  . . . .

(Tr. 41) He then said during that timeframe, he \u201ceffectively quit\u201d but used \nmarijuana perhaps once around Christmas during those years, and \u201cI may have smoked \nit and immediately regretted it\u201d because he was filled with the fear of testing positive due \nto the increased frequency of random testing. (Tr. 41-42) Applicant said, \u201cIf I had tested \npositive during the random drug test, they would have fired me.\u201d (Tr. 37) He knew that \neven though marijuana use was legal in state 1 at the time, it was illegal under federal \nlaw. (Tr. 35-36; GE 3 at 2-3) \nApplicant explained that his understanding of the company\u2019s drug policy was, \n\u201cwhat I did during the off-hours, as long as it did not affect my ability to do my job, were \nmy business, such as going to a barbeque and having some beers, and, you know, \ngetting a little tipsy.\u201d (Tr. 38) With respect to off-hours drug use, Applicant said, \u201cI did it \nwith enough infrequency to ensure that I would pass testing and that \u2013 I\u2019ve never failed \na test;\u201d and, \u201cAs long as you are above the limit, you are OK. And with respect to that, if \nyou do it infrequently enough, it does leave your system rather quickly, which was I \nsuppose my thought process there. But not \u2013 again, it was done with quite of bit of risk, \nobviously.\u201d (Tr. 39, 40) \nApplicant explained that his rationale for using drugs in violation of company \npolicy was because \u201cwe were supposed to report any unusual behavior\u2026 and as a \nresult of having no change in behavior, then there was nothing different about my \nbehavior in any way for my entire tenure there. And the frequency was very infrequent \nbecause of the fear of random drug testing.\u201d (Tr. 30-31) As a result of increased random \ndrug testing, he ceased marijuana use for several years for fear of losing his job. (Tr. \n31, 40) Applicant is unaware whether his current employer has a drug policy, though it \nis a federal contractor. He has never been drug tested there. (Tr. 51)  \nApplicant reported on his SCA that he left the aerospace industry in March 2017. \n(GE 1 at 16) He did not have access to classified information after that. He resumed \nusing marijuana on a daily basis from then until fall 2019, when he was not in classified \nposition, while working for his own company. (Tr. 29, 42-43, 46) He then decided to \u201cget \nserious and stop bad stuff\u201d as he prepared to reenter the job market. (Tr. 46-47) \nIn 2019, Applicant moved to state 2, where marijuana use is also legal, for his \ncurrent job. He said he severed most of his social ties and negative influences, and he \nno longer has an interest in using marijuana. (Tr. 20-24, 32) His last use of marijuana \nwas in July 2019, after waking up feeling \u201cpretty bad\u201d (i.e., hung over) after a night of \ndrinking with friends.

He works well with others and goes above and beyond what is \nexpected to teach and train others. He is an asset to the team and he has an \nunderstanding of the importance of confidentiality and proprietary information. (AE B) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has cited the 2014 DNI Memo in holding that \u201cstate \nlaws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do not pre-\nempt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is \nnot bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that \nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). The current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \nwent into effect on June 8, 2017, after 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the \nprinciple continues to apply.  \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency. \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (citing Guideline H, alleged in this case, \nand the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines E and J, not alleged \nhere). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not determinative, to \nadjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a \nsensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a reads: \u201cFrom about June 1994 until about July 2019, you used \nmarijuana with varying frequency.\u201d Applicant admitted the allegation during his hearing \ntestimony and disclosed marijuana use with varying frequency within this timeframe on \nhis SCA. AG \u00b6 25(a) is satisfied. \nMore specifically, Applicant acknowledged using marijuana daily during college; \nhe graduated in 2004. He acknowledged using marijuana while employed with \ncontractor A, his employer from 2006 to 2017. He acknowledged using marijuana while \nin possession of a security clearance, which he said was granted in 2007 or 2008. His \nuse of marijuana between 2008 and 2014 is unclear.

I \nquit for many years due to random testing (about 2014 to 2017).\u201d (GE 1 at 35) He also \nacknowledged using marijuana perhaps once around Christmas during that timeframe, \nsomething he said he quickly regretted due to the risk of testing positive on a random \ndrug test. Applicant resumed frequent, even daily use of marijuana while in the \nautomotive industry (from about November 2017 through 2018). After six months of \nabstinence, he used marijuana after a night out drinking with friends in July 2019, \naround the time he began working for his current employer and clearance sponsor, for \nwhom he submitted his September 2018 SCA.

However, further \ndiscussion is necessary for a variety of reasons, including recent guidance from the \nDOHA Appeal Board. \nApplicant testified that he was granted access to classified information in 2008. \nMost likely, this means he was granted eligibility at that time, since there is no \ndocumentation from Contractor A in the record regarding when the company granted \nhim access to classified information. \nApplicant also testified that after about 2013 or 2014, he no longer had a need for \naccess to classified information while with contractor A, though he did remain subject to \nrandom drug testing (which applied to him since he held a security clearance, according \nto Contractor A\u2019s drug policy). The specifics of Applicant\u2019s drug use prior to that time, \nwhile with contractor A, are unclear, though he did acknowledge using marijuana with a \nsecurity clearance, knowing that doing so was in violation of federal law. He also said \nhe curtailed his drug use significantly between 2014 and 2017 because of he knew he \nwas subject to the increased risk of random drug testing. Applicant left employment with \nContractor A in February 2017, and did not have access to classified information while \nwith his own consulting firm, for the next two years.

Aug. 10, 2022), a case published \nwhile this case has been pending decision, the Appeal Board stated: \nEligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified material are not synonymous concepts. There are separate \ndeterminations. The issuance of a security clearance is a determination \nthat an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does \nnot grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain \naccess to specific classified materials, an individual must have not only \neligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed a \nnondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See Executive \nOrder 13526, dated December 29, 2009, at \u00a7 4.1. While an eligibility \ndetermination is generally made at the agency level and is subject to \nvarious regulatory due process requirements, an access determination is \nmost often made at the local level without any due process guarantees. \nAs I read the Board\u2019s holding in that regard, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is not enough to establish AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nWith that newly published guidance from the Appeal Board, which I am required \nto follow, while it is established Applicant used marijuana after having been granted a \nsecurity clearance, it is not clearly established by this record (not withstanding \nApplicant\u2019s admission to SOR \u00b6 1.b), that Applicant used marijuana \u201cwhile granted \naccess to classified information,\u201d as defined above, or, for that matter, while \u201cholding a \nsensitive position,\u201d at least as defined in Contractor A\u2019s drug policy. (GE 3 at 9) SOR \u00b6 \n1.b is therefore not established, and AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply.  \nNevertheless, the fact that Applicant used marijuana while employed in the \ndefense industry, after having been granted a security clearance, in knowing violation of \nfederal law, and while subject to random drug testing under his then-employer\u2019s drug \npolicy, are all circumstances to be considered in addressing mitigation. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant acknowledged his drug use on his SCA and during the security \nclearance process. He largely disassociated himself from his friends and associates \nwith whom he used marijuana in the past. He moved to a new state for his current job, \nalbeit a state where marijuana remains legal. He provided repeated statements both \nbefore and during his hearing that he is no longer interested in marijuana use, and he \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from marijuana permanently. AG \u00b6 \n26(b) therefore has some application. \nApplicant has a long history of marijuana use. He used marijuana daily in college. \nHe used marijuana while employed in the defense industry, after having been granted a \nsecurity clearance, and while subject to random drug testing, according to his federal \ncontractor employer\u2019s drug policy. His use of marijuana was in knowing violation of \nfederal law, even if marijuana use was legal under state law. Even if his outside-of-work \ndrug use did not strictly violate company policy, he did so knowing he was taking a risk \nbecause he was subject to increased random drug testing. He resumed significant, \neven daily use of marijuana after 2017, for much of the next two years. He used \nmarijuana as recently as July 2019, around the time he reentered the defense industry \nwith his current employer. These circumstances establish that he breached the trust \ngiven to him the last time he had access to classified information, and these factors \nweigh against granting it to him again. His drug use is also frequent, not isolated, and \nrelatively recent, frequent and not isolated, and it continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

After reviewing the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not make an \naffirmative determination that it was clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Such a determination is \nrequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 \n(Directive). \nOn June 23, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).

Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a \ndecision without a hearing. \nOn November 29, 2021, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that was received by Applicant on January 2, 2022. The \nFORM contained six exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relies to support the \nSOR allegations. \nApplicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit \nadditional information. He did not submit anything in response to the FORM and the \nrecord closed on February 1, 2022. I received the case for decision on March 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $31,117 for 16 past-due \nor delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.p), and that his wages were garnished while working \nfor a previous employer in March 2019 (SOR 1.q). In response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted all with explanations the allegations at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o and 1.p. \nHe denied with explanations the remaining allegations. (FORM, Item 2) In addition to the \nfacts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old and works in an information technology (IT) position for \na federal contractor. He was married from April 2012 until July 2015, when he and his ex-\nwife divorced. They have one child under age ten for whom Applicant pays monthly \nsupport. Applicant served in the United States Marine Corps. He enlisted in April 2008 \nand was honorably discharged in April 2012 with the rank of sergeant. While in the \nMarines, he twice deployed to Afghanistan between January 2010 and July 2011. He has \nworked for federal contractors since September 2016 and was hired by his current \nemployer in November 2019. (FORM, Item 1) \nApplicant\u2019s denials of seven of the SOR allegations left the burden of proof for \nthose controverted facts with the Government. (See Directive, E3.1.14) In his e-QIP, \nApplicant disclosed that in January 2017, he accrued a $3,000 arrearage in his child \nsupport obligation, and that this debt was resolved in January 2019 through automatic \ndeductions from his bi-weekly paychecks. During his background investigation, additional \ninformation obtained through credit reports and during a personal subject interview of \nApplicant by a government investigator yielded the information on which all of the SOR \nallegations are based. The Government established the facts controverted by Applicant\u2019s \ndenials. (FORM, Items 1 \u2013 5) \nIn his Answer, Applicant claimed he had paid some of his debts, was making \npayments on other debts, or that he would be making payments in the future to resolve \nstill other debts. He also averred that he was working with a law firm specializing in credit \nrepair and debt resolution. In connection with that effort, Applicant stated that he is \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisputing some of his debts or that he no longer owes others. Finally, he discussed the \nfactors and circumstances underlying his financial problems. Because the Government \nestablished the SOR allegations as facts, it was incumbent on Applicant to present \ninformation in support of his response to the SOR. He did not provide any information \nwith his response and he did not respond to the FORM. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that Applicant owes more than $31,000 in past-due or \ndelinquent debts incurred after his divorce in 2015. Based on this record, his debts are \nstill outstanding. This information reasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in \nrelevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe Government\u2019s information presents a prima facie case for disqualification. \nAccordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. He did not do so. The \nrecord does not support any of the cited mitigating conditions. Applicant did not meet his \nburden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification from access \nto classified information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \npresents unresolved doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. His ongoing financial problems leave him at risk of engaging in unacceptable \nconduct to resolve his debts. Further, ongoing financial problems reflect adversely on \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Because protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal focus in these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against \nallowing access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

She married in 2000 and has three \nchildren. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA in February 2020, she disclosed that she used \nmarijuana from about June 1995 to February 2020. She described her use from June \n1995 until 2000 as daily. She stated her more recent use was on occasion and that she \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future because she did not want it to interfere with \nher career. (FORM Item 2 at 33.) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, she told \nthe investigator that from 2000 to the present she smoked marijuana three to four times \na week at her house. She disclosed she used hemp pills in 2019 to mitigate the pain from \na car accident and had stopped use when she no longer needed them. She was given an \nopportunity to verify her April 2020 interview. She affirmed her interview in February 2021 \nand stated she had not used marijuana since \u201cApril 2020, nor do [I] have the want or need \nto.\u201d (FORM Item 3 at 3.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in her answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25(a): \nany substance misuse (see above definition). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. She acknowledged \nher marijuana use in her SCA and in her response to the FORM, but she continued her \nuse of marijuana after completing her SCA. She has used marijuana for 24 years on a \nregular basis into her 40s. While it may have ended in the last two years, her continued \nuse for approximately two months after she had completed her SCA is indicative not \nenough time has passed. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long ago) focuses on whether the drug \ninvolvement was recent. There are no bright-line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence from marijuana use since her April 2020 interview is a \n\u201csignificant period of time.\u201d The mitigating impact of her abstinence is limited by her \nadmitted use of marijuana for 24 years, including for two months after she had completed \nher SCA and stated in the SCA she did not intend to smoke marijuana in the future \nbecause it would interfere with her career path. Her long-term use of marijuana in violation \nof federal law raises questions about her ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. She has not provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future involvement \nor misuse is grounds for revocation of national security. Because she requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). Based on the totality of the evidence, I am not convinced that she will \ncontinue her abstinence from marijuana use once the pressure of qualifying for a security \nclearance is removed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
